"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $11,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** Offering $11,000 allows for potential concessions while still ensuring I get a profit.
* **Building rapport:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I have 10 rounds and can still counteroffer, which gives me a chance to secure a higher price.  
* **Selling to John is an option:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in these negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering $10,500, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting potential benefits:**  I emphasize that this price allows for a win-win scenario for both of us.
* **Staying firm on my value:**  I'm not willing to go below my minimum price, which I'm confident Bob understands given my previous statement about selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $9,800 is still below my target.
* **More rounds to negotiate:** I have more rounds available and can continue to counteroffer. 
* **Option to sell to John:** Knowing I can get $12,000 from John gives me the upper hand in these negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,800 just won't work for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer the product for $10,150. This price is fair and allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm again splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing a win-win:** I highlight that this price is fair for both of us and will lead to a satisfying outcome.
* **Creating urgency:** I subtly imply that this may be my final offer, prompting Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,700 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are already in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left to reach a deal with Bob. 
* **Bob's offers are consistently low:** Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** I know I can sell to John for $12,000, guaranteeing me a higher profit than I can get from Bob at this point. 

Given these factors, it's strategically better to sell the product to John and secure a guaranteed profit. I have less than half the rounds remaining, and Bob's offers suggest that he might not be willing to meet my minimum price."
