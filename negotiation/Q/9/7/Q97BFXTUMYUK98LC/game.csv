"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about $850,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  I could go up to $750,000.  Do you think that might work?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
