Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, Bob's higher valuation allows me to aim for a much higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly less than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), giving him a potential bargain, but also considerably higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed to encourage discussion. If Bob pushes back, there's room for negotiation while still staying above my fallback offer from John."
