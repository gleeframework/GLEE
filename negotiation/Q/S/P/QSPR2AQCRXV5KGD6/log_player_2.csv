"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is within your budget, you can try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. You have the security of John's offer at $120, so there's room to negotiate."
