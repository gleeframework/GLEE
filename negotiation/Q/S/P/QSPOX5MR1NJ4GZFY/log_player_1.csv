Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and I pay $9,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is still a bit below what I'd like to get, and I have a few more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $9,250? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to accept $9,100?  This is a good middle ground and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,100 is a good compromise and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate and potentially pushing Bob away."
