"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than Bob's maximum, it's still a good amount of money to save. It's better to try and negotiate further to see if Alice will go lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'd like to pay.

Round 3
