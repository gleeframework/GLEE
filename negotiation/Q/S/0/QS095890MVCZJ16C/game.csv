"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900,000 was a bit steep, but $750,000 is a significant discount from the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $825,000 is closer, it's still slightly above my budget. I'm confident we can find a win-win solution. I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
