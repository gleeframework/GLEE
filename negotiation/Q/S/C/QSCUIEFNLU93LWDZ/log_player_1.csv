Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is very valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  It's a great deal considering what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my desired value but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value the product has for Bob to make him more motivated to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  By offering $9,500, I give Bob some wiggle room to make a counteroffer without immediately hitting my ""sell to John"" price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $10,000, there's a chance I can get closer to that by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value for Bob:** I'm reminding Bob that $8,500 is still a good deal for him, considering the value of the product.
* **Collaborative Approach:**  I'm using language that suggests a partnership to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. Further negotiation might lead to a slightly better price, but the risk of continuing is high.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable value.
* **Time Consideration:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob could take more time, which might not be worth the potential small increase in price. 

I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed sale with John, as it minimizes risk and ensures I meet my minimum earnings goal."
