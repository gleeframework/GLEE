Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be extremely valuable to you.  What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $950,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept the offer. Alice has come down to $950,000, which is still above his maximum of $800,000, but it's getting closer to that number.  He can always negotiate further if he wants to try to get a lower price, but at this point, it's a good deal."
