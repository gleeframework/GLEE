"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget.  Since you know you can get the same product from John for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting her offer keeps the option open for potentially getting a better deal from her later or finding a better alternative."
