"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business. To start the negotiation, I propose a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers substantial value, and after considering its potential benefits for your business, I believe a price of $1,650,000 is more than fair.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still a bit constrained by my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,550,000. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,550,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $1,600,000 for this deal to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting close to a deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1,600,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,580,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1580000.0,Bob,6,
