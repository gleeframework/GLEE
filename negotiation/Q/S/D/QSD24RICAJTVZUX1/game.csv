"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $13500. However, I am hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $12000, which aligns more closely with the value I place on the product?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $12500.
