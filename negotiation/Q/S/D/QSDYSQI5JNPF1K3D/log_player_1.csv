Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower.  
* **Strong Starting Point:** By starting at your desired price, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Avoid Underselling:** Offering it for less than $10,000 would be leaving money on the table."
