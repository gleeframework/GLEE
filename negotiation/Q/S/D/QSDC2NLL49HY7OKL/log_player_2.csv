"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product at a very competitive price of $1,000,000. It's a significant opportunity for you, considering its worth to you.  I understand you have a different valuation, but this price allows for a substantial profit and a strong return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than her valuation, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, making Alice's offer unattractive."
