Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price that reflects the value of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate and believe I can secure a better deal.  We're early in the negotiation, and I want to test his willingness to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a significant gap from what I have in mind. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,275,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a considerable compromise on my end."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000. This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a bit more, accepting his offer of $1,225,000 secures a significant profit above my baseline and avoids the risk of him walking away. It's better to take this deal than risk getting stuck with no deal or having to settle for John's offer of $1,200,000."
