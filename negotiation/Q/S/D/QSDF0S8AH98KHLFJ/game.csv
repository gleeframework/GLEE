"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider something closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $800,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $800,000 is still a bit steep for my budget though.  Could we agree on $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit above your target price. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for sticking with me on this. $775,000 is getting close, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $762,500?  I'm hoping we can make a deal!",762500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $762,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a slight adjustment, though. I can meet you halfway between $775,000 and $762,500, which would be $768,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",768750.0,Alice,7,
