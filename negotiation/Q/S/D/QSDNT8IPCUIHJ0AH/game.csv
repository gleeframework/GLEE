"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident you'll find this price to be fair considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
