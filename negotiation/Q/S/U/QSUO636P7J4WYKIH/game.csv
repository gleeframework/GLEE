"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000, which is a great deal considering its true value to you is $1500000. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Can you meet me in the middle?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think $1000000 is a fair price, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm offering it to you for $1300000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering its value to you is $1500000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value I've placed on it, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to negotiate a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm willing to hold out for the best price, so I'm sticking with my original offer of $1200000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to explore other options, including selling to John for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
