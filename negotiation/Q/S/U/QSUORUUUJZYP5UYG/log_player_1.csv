Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while minimizing risk."
