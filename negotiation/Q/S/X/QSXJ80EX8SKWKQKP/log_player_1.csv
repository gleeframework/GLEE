Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $130. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

This starting offer attempts to:

* **Establish Value:**  The message hints at the product's value to Bob without explicitly revealing its worth to Alice. 
* **Anchor High:**  Starting with a price above the middle ground ($125) sets a high anchor, potentially leading to a higher final price even with negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to counteroffer,  showing flexibility and willingness to make a deal. 
 
Alice needs to be prepared to adjust her strategy based on Bob's response, always keeping in mind her minimum acceptable price of $100 and the backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent offer, Alice knows Bob values the product at $150. Rejecting this offer and providing a counteroffer keeps the negotiation open with the potential for a higher sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we split the difference and settle at $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This common negotiation tactic suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $125 is a price Alice is comfortable with, exceeding her minimum and capitalizing on Bob's higher valuation.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** A quick counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and prevents stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $125. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  While not the ideal price, $115 still nets Alice a $15 profit over her minimum. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further haggling might only yield small increments, potentially not justifying the time and effort. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might walk away with each counteroffer, leaving Alice to settle for John's $100 offer. 

It's a good business decision to secure a reasonable profit now rather than risk losing the sale for a slightly higher amount."
