"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $820,000. This is closer to what I consider a fair value for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",820000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $820,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $900,000?  This still leaves a good margin for you and allows me to make a decent profit. Let's keep the negotiations going.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about $925,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to acquire a valuable product while ensuring I can get a reasonable return. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  $890,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about $910,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm confident this price would allow you to utilize the product to its full potential. What do you say?",910000.0,Alice,7,
