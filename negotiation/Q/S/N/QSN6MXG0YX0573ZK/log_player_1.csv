I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and get closer to my asking price in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand your position, I would like to stick to my original offer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob is not budging from his offer, and I'm not willing to go that low. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
