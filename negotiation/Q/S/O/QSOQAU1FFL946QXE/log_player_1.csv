Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is closer to my ideal price than John's offer of $10,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not asking for the full $15,000 Bob values it at, leaving room for counteroffers and a potential compromise. 
* **Framing it positively:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, making it more likely he'll be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I can likely get closer to $13,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $13,000 to $12,000. 
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing this as a fair compromise, emphasizing that it benefits both of us.
* **Open to further negotiation:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, keeping the door open for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $11500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** While I'd prefer $12,000, $11,500 is only $500 less than my last offer. This is a good deal for me, especially compared to John's offer of $10,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, it's possible he'll either reject it completely or continue lowering his price, risking me ending up with John's offer.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
