Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to make a decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer outright.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $100,000 discount from the product's perceived value to him.
    * Alice makes a $100,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer."
