"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is valuable, but not at that price. How about we start around $6,000? ",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to offer $7,000.  That's a fair price considering my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",9000.0,Alice,5,
