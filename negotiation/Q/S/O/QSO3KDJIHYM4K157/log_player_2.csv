Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, she's still significantly above your maximum budget and your alternative option. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is the best outcome for you. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice and potentially missing out on John's offer."
