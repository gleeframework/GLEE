"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.",925000.0,Alice,3,
