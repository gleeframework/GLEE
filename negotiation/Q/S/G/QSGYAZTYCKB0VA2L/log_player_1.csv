Round 4

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, I'm still confident I can get a slightly higher price, especially since I only have 6 rounds left. I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my previous offer.  Let's compromise at $900,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit more than I'd hoped to spend.  Would you consider $890,000? I'm hoping we can close this deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred a slightly higher price, it's getting close to my minimum, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of ending up with John's offer which is significantly lower."
