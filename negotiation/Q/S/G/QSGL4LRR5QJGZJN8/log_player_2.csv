"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $110 is a decent price, you know you can get the product for $120 from John if necessary. There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one."
