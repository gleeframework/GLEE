"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is less than your maximum budget of $120, it's still a bit more than the product is worth to Alice.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
