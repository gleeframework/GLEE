"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $140? I'm really interested in the product, but that's the most I can do right now.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at 160? I'm willing to compromise to find a deal that works for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $155. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to get the product within my budget.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than 165. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,
