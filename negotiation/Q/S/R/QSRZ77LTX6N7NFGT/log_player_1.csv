Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $10,000, so she wants at least this much.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to this amount.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $10,000 if Bob declines.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for a price that maximizes her profit while still being enticing for Bob. Offering the product for slightly less than Bob's maximum valuation makes sense. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to own this valuable product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Why This Works**

* **Profit Maximization:** This price nets Alice $1,500 more than her minimum and John's offer.
* **Appealing to Bob:** The price is still $500 less than Bob's valuation, making it a good deal for him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
