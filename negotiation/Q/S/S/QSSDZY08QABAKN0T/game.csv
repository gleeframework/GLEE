Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.,950000.0,Alice,1,,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $950000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $850000, but I'd like to see if we can meet at $825000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm willing to sell the product to you for $887500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",887500.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $862500. However, I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price, so I'll make a slightly lower offer of $825000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at this price.",825000.0,Bob,6,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $825000, but I need you to throw in some extras or concessions to make it worth my while. I'm thinking a warranty or some additional support services would be a good start. Can you consider that?",825000.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,
"I understand your request, Bob, and I'm willing to consider some extras to sweeten the deal. However, I'm not willing to go as far as offering a warranty or additional support services. Instead, I'm willing to throw in a premium upgrade package that includes some exclusive features and priority customer support. I'll sell the product to you for $825000, and include the upgrade package as a one-time offer. This is the best deal I can offer at this point.",825000.0,Alice,9,,yes
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the upgrade package, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $825000. I'll make one final offer: I'll meet you at $800000, and I'll also accept the upgrade package. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",800000.0,Bob,10,,
