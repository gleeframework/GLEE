"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) to give myself some room to negotiate. I'm also framing it positively by highlighting the product's value to Bob and emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect. This helps to initiate the negotiation in a favorable way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a fair offer, I need to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice! However, $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for it, which is the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $96. This is a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 96}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $96 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $94 for it, which is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not ready to give up yet. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm hoping to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95.  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice! However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for it, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a higher price. To ensure I get at least my minimum, I will sell the product to John for $120."
