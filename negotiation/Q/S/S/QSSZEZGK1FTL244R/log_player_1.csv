{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I've chosen a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.  $150 is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open-Ended:**  The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

I'm prepared to counteroffer if necessary, and I have the option to sell to John for $100 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe there's room for a higher price. I'm rejecting his offer and will make a counteroffer to try and secure a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135. This still gives you a great deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm lowering my price by $15 from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open-Ended:** The question ""What do you think?"" keeps the negotiation open. 

I believe $135 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $120, but I'm not going any lower. If he rejects, I'll sell to John for $100."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering $120, which is in the middle of my previous offer ($135) and Bob's offer ($115). 
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to finalize the deal at this price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and hoping to reach a mutually agreeable solution.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $100."
