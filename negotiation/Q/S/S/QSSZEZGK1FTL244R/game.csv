"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135. This still gives you a great deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal. ",120.0,Alice,5,
