Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,650,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $1,550,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly engaged in negotiation. I'll counter in the next round to try and keep the price moving closer to $1,600,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

We're getting close, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. Bob consistently meeting me halfway suggests he's willing to go higher. Let's see if we can push a bit further in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I respect your position.  Let's split the difference again - $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties."",

Round 8

Bob is no longer meeting me halfway - his compromises are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll go much higher than $1,550,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit over John's offer."
