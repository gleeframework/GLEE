"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, it's valued at $15,000 to us. However, I understand the value you place on this product and am willing to negotiate. Would you be interested in acquiring it for $12,000? This represents a significant saving for you while ensuring we receive a fair compensation for our efforts and investment. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your ideal price. If not, you're still secure in buying from John."
