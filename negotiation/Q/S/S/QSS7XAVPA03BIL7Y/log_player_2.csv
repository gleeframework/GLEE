"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing her to lower the price closer to her valuation. You're still willing to buy from John for $1,000,000 as a backup, so you hold a strong position."
