{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's value of $100 but below your minimum of $120. It leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, below my minimum of $120. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'd like to try to get even closer. Would you be willing to meet me at $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's closer to my minimum. I'm going to try to get a little more out of the negotiation by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $98 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's compromise at $102.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and it's closer to your budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make one final offer of $99. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $100 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  Since John is willing to pay my full asking price of $120,  it makes more sense for me to sell to John. This will ensure I get the best possible return for the product."
