Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it without feeling pressured.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with a question invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value and Negotiation Room:** Bob's offer of $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it's lower than my desired price. This indicates there's still room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Since I know the product is worth $150 to Bob, I believe I can likely get a higher price than $100. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  While selling to John for $80 is an option, it's a lower price than I'm aiming for.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than $120 to incentivize him to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still a little low for me. How about $110? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by dropping the price from $120 to $110. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Value-Based Argument:** I'm reiterating the product's value and emphasizing that $110 is a fair price for both parties.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product and suggesting that Bob will be happy with the purchase, further encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $105? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than selling to John. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Bob walking away or getting a lower price if I need to sell to John.
* **Fair Compromise:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a couple more dollars, $105 is a fair compromise and a good outcome. 

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $105, as it's a good balance between maximizing my earnings and securing the sale."
