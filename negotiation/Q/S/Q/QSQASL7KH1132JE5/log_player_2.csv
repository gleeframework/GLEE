"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $120 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $120, and it's within my budget of $100. While it might be a bit low, I'm aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us.  It's likely Alice will counter, but this gives me a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $110 is only $10 more than what I can get from John. While I would prefer to pay less, the risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate and having to buy from John at a higher price isn't worth it. Accepting the offer allows me to get the product within my budget and avoid further negotiation."
