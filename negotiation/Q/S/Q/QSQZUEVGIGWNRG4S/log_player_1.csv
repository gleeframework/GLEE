Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, hoping to get a good price.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to what I need for the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $125 isn't my ideal price, it's better than selling to John and it seems like we're close to a deal.  I'll take the profit and move on."
