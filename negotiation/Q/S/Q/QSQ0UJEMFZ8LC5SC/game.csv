"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a significant investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which reflects the value of this product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in continuing the negotiation.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider it?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it still falls short of my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to consider a final compromise of $1,040,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's the best I can do.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to consider this final counteroffer.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,040,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer $1,015,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1015000.0,Bob,6,
