Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $105. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $110.

Round 6

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that we may not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
