"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let's start with a price of $900,000. This leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle at $750,000? This ensures a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,
