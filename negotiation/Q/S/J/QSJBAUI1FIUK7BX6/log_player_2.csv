"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting and counter-offering again is the best strategy to try and save more."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal this round."", ""product_price"": 10500}
