""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $600,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects a more realistic valuation of the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget in mind, but let's be realistic about the value here. This product is a game-changer, and the return you'll see will far outweigh the initial investment. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is still very far from a reasonable price point. Her ""final offer"" statement doesn't hold much weight at this stage. We should continue negotiating and see if we can get her to significantly lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but that price is still significantly outside my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering John is offering me the same product for the same price."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** We're now anchoring our offer to John's price, creating a strong justification for our position.
* **Finality:** By stating this is our final offer, we're increasing the pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Transparency:**  We're being transparent about our alternative option, signaling that we're serious about walking away if she doesn't budge."
