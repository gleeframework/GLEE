Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I want to try to get closer to my desired price before selling to John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $950,000 is a bit too low for me at this stage. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still offers you a significant value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, and I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This offer is closer to my desired price point and I don't want to risk losing the deal by counter-offering again.  It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale at $1,000,000."
