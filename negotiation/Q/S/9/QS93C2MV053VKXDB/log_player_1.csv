{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, knowing John provides a safety net.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer.  He might be willing to go a bit above $800,000.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly."
