Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net of $800,000, aiming high with Bob is crucial to maximize profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain for Alice.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price without revealing its true worth to Alice.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob (who values the product highly) and leaving room for Alice to potentially negotiate a price even closer to his $1,000,000 valuation."
