``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to entice him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to ensure I get a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I make a profit on the product. I'm confident I can get a better price in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. If you're serious about getting it, let's close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering my minimum acceptable price of $100, which is also the price John is willing to pay. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and trying to create a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me at $100, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, I've reached my limit. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already offered him my lowest price. I don't want to risk going further down and losing out on a guaranteed $100 from John. It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
