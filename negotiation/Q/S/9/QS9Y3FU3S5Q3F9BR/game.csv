,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $120.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $145 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really keen on getting this product, but I can't go above $130. Would you be willing to consider that? ",130.0,Bob,4,
