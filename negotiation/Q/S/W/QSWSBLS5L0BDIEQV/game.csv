"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and is the most I can offer at this time.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,250,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value the product brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
