"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I like the direction we're heading, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000 just yet. How about we meet in the middle again, at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you negotiating with me.  To be honest, $12,500 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works, we have a deal!",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob! $12,500 is a great offer, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm on a tight budget.  $12,500 is my final offer.  If you can't do it, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. It's my minimum price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet there. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at $13,000 or if you'd like to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,9,
