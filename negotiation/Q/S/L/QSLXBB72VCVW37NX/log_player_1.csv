Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield a better profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price of $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob recognizes the product's value to him ($800,000). This price is significantly lower than my minimum and still provides a substantial profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price slightly high, allowing for potential negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price."
