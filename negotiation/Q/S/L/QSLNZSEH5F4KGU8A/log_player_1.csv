"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible price.  While Bob values the product at $12,000, I need to make sure I get at least my minimum of $15,000.  Starting at $18,000 gives room for negotiation and hopefully brings us closer to a win-win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  There's still room to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $16,000, which is still above my minimum of $15,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while also staying firm on my bottom line. Hopefully, this compromise will lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price.  I have a guaranteed offer from John, so I can afford to be more patient and see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my final offer.  It's my minimum price, and I'm confident that Bob will see it's a fair deal.  If he doesn't accept, I'll move on to John and secure the $15,000.  There's no point in further negotiating if I'm not willing to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my minimum price and Bob isn't willing to go any higher. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed offer from John for $15,000."
