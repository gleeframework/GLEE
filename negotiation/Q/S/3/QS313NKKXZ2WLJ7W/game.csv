"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $110? I think it's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're making a serious effort to get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $107.50. That's as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",107.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $107.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $102?",102.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we meet at $105, but I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $10? That way, you'll get an even better deal, and I'll still be able to cover my costs.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of the free accessory, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $102, and throw in the accessory as well?",102.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $103, and I'll throw in the accessory as well? This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",103.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've decided to stop negotiating and buy the product from John for $120. Thank you for the opportunity to negotiate, but I think I've found a better deal elsewhere.",120.0,Bob,10,
