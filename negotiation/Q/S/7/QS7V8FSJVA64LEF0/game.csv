"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell at a high price. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration range.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value this product at a much higher price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm confident this product can deliver significant value to your business, and I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price reflects a considerable reduction from my initial offer and shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet your latest offer of $1,100,000.
