{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 

* **Reasoning:**  
    * **$1,400,000** is a significant profit for me, exceeding my minimum value by $400,000.
    * It's also below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
    * This approach allows for potential counteroffers, maximizing my chances of earning the highest possible price.
    * If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,300,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still profitable for me, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't reflect the true value of the product. 
* I'm confident that I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* I'm prepared to counteroffer and see if I can bridge the gap between our desired prices. 
* Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a significant loss compared to what I believe I can achieve through further negotiation with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding middle ground:** My counteroffer of $1,350,000 splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,300,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still securing a decent profit.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product and my willingness to work with Bob to reach an agreement.
* **Setting a clear boundary:** By refusing to go lower than $1,350,000, I establish a clear boundary and show that I'm serious about getting a fair price.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a position of strength. If Bob rejects this offer, I can assess his next move and decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,280,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining leverage:**  Bob's offer of $1,280,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate, I can potentially secure a price closer to my desired $1,350,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would guarantee me a profit, but it's a significant loss compared to what I could achieve with Bob. It's more worthwhile to try and bridge the gap with Bob for a larger profit. 

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired $1,350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a great price, and I admire that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle at $1,320,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, while giving you a substantial discount. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1320000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer again splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,350,000) and Bob's current offer ($1,280,000). It shows continued flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining value:** I still emphasize the product's value, suggesting that this price represents a significant deal for Bob. 
* **Pushing for a final agreement:** This counteroffer aims to bring us closer to a final agreement while still maintaining a reasonable profit for myself. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider my next move.  I can either continue negotiating, or accept John's offer of $1,000,000 to secure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,250,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation might result in a deal too close to my minimum, leaving me with very little profit.
* **Risk of Further Decreases:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead Bob to lower his offer even further, potentially pushing me below my minimum and making the deal unprofitable.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit, ensuring I don't end up in a situation where I lose money or settle for a price I'm not comfortable with.

While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, the risk of further negotiation going awry outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal.  It's time to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John."
