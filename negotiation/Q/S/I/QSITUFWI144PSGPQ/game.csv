"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in this product but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could we work something closer to  $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
