"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This gives us room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good profit.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $16,000.  This price still gives you a great value, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my desired price but still shows flexibility. 
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value to Bob while also indicating my own need to make a profit. 
* **Positive tone:**  I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  We've gone through a few rounds, and it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement that meets both of our needs. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I receive my minimum price, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
