"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also positions me to get a good price.
* **Appealing to Value:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that he's getting a good deal at this price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than the $1,250,000 offer I made in the previous round.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get a better price than Bob's offer. 
* **Time to counter:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  $1,150,000 is my best price for this product right now.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $1,150,000, which is a more significant compromise than his previous offer. This shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Maintain Margin:** Even at $1,150,000, I'm still getting a price that's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Urgency:**  I subtly emphasize that this is my best price, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. Can you reconsider your price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,075,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and only a slight increase from his previous offer.
* **Risk of losing time:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting valuable rounds, which could lead to me having to settle for a lower price or potentially even lose the opportunity to sell to John. 
* **John is a safer option:**  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, selling to him ensures I get the best possible deal and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $1,125,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Value:**  I'm keeping my offer above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I still get a good deal even with this concession.
* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm making a small compromise, but still maintaining a firm stance. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't be swayed too easily.
* **Focus on Value:** I remind Bob of the value he'll receive from the product, hoping to make the offer more appealing.
* **Limited Rounds:** The time pressure from the limited rounds is a factor in my decision to make a counteroffer. While I'm not yet ready to sell to John, I want to avoid losing too much time with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Can you reconsider your price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:** $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. There is little hope of reaching an agreement at this point.
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 6, meaning I only have 4 rounds left to reach a deal.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing valuable time and potentially having to settle for a lower price.
* **John is a guaranteed deal:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids any further risk of negotiation with Bob. 

Given these factors, selling to John is the most rational decision. It guarantees a higher price and avoids the uncertainty and potential losses associated with further negotiations with Bob."
