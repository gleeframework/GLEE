Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

While a higher price is ideal, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,125,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
