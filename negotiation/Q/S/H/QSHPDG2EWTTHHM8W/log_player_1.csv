"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I appreciate his interest, $900,000 is too low for me.  I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is simply too far below what I need to sell.  I'm happy to come down a bit, but I'm proposing $1,050,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below the $1 million value I hold for the product. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not ready to accept his offer just yet.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $1,012,500 for the product.  I'm committed to finding a resolution, and I think this is a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1012500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $997500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $997,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $997,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm sticking with my goal of getting as close to $1 million as possible.  While $997,500 is tempting, I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price, but I'm still open to a fair compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd love to get a higher price, I've reached a point where the potential for further negotiation with Bob is too risky. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a much safer option than continuing with Bob and risking a lower final price or a complete breakdown in negotiations.  It's time to move on to a secure deal."
