"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1500000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1200000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1350000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000, as I mentioned before. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm starting to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
