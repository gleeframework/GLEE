"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of great value to you, for a price I'm confident is fair. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product just yet, I assure you it's worth at least $10000 to me. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to someone else.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",15000.0,Alice,1,
