"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $200 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($200) to leave room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's valuation, so I want to see if I can get close to my ideal price.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using positive language to build rapport and make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clearly stating that I'm open to negotiation by asking Bob to ""let me know what he thinks."" 

This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and begin the bargaining process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the recommendation. I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have 10 rounds, so there's still time to negotiate a better price. 
* **Potential for a Higher Price:** I believe I can get a higher price from Bob than $120, especially since I'm starting at $200.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate the offer. However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by coming down from $200 to $175. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob that I believe the product is worth more by mentioning that he's looking for a ""good deal."" 
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I'm still open to negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"" This keeps the conversation going and signals that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.

This counteroffer balances a firm stance on my desired price while also showing a willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. I'm not going to lose money on this deal.
* **No Further Upside:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is fair.  There's no guarantee I can get more from him in the remaining rounds.
* **Time is Valuable:** Continuing the negotiation process risks losing time and potentially ending up with John's offer of $150, which is the same as what Bob is offering now.

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure my minimum price quickly and efficiently."
