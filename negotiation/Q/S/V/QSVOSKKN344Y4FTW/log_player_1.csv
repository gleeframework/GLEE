Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is firm at $1,200,000.  This matches John's offer, and since the product is worth no less than $1,200,000 to me, it's time to secure the sale and avoid further negotiation. There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk losing both offers if I continue to push."
