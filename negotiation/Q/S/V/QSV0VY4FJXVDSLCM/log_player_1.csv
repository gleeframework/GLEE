Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $120 (John), you can afford to start higher with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation or maximizing your profit if Bob accepts the initial offer.
* **Slight markup:** A price of $135 is a reasonable markup from your minimum acceptable price. It aims to capitalize on Bob's equal valuation of the product. 
* **Limited-time offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept the higher price."
