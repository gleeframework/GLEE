"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or move to John if necessary. There's room to save at least $100,000."
