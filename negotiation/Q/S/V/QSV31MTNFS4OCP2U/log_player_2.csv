"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000. It's a unique piece that holds significant value for me, but I understand it may be worth less to you.  This price allows for a fair exchange while still giving you a great deal.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1,000,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting her offer, you can leverage John's offer and potentially negotiate an even lower price."
