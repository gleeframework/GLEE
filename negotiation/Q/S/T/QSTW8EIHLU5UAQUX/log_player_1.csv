Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and meet at $85?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also keeping my eye on John as a potential buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $82? This is a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $79? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm running out of time.  John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, so it's the most sensible option at this point."
