Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives you a great opportunity. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000** is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob. 
* It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $1,200,000, giving me a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I could accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, it would result in a large financial loss. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand it's a significant investment, but this product holds a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $1,050,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). 
* **Message:**  The message is polite but firm, acknowledging Bob's offer but reiterating the value of the product. It also emphasizes the compromise by suggesting a meeting in the middle.
* **Next Steps:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation but also demonstrates my willingness to be flexible. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to weigh the potential of another counteroffer against the certainty of selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is still the most financially beneficial option.  However, I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob.  He's shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's still potential to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $975,000 is getting closer. But I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the progress we've made.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,012,500, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,050,000) and Bob's latest offer ($975,000).  
* **Message:** The message remains friendly but firm,  acknowledging Bob's compromise while highlighting the value of the product.  It also emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the split-the-difference approach.
* **Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John. However, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price from Bob."
