"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives you a great opportunity. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand it's a significant investment, but this product holds a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $975,000 is getting closer. But I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the progress we've made.  Let's make this deal happen.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
