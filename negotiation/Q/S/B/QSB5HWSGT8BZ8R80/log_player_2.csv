"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows that the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price that's closer to that value. This should give Alice some incentive to negotiate further while still being a good deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $12,500, which is within Bob's budget. Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product for a good price without the risk of further negotiation potentially falling apart.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a chance Alice could reject another counteroffer, leaving him with no deal. At this price point, the risk of losing the deal is greater than the potential savings from further negotiation."
