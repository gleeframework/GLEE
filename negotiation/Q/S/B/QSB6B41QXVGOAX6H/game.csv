"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product holds significant value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $680,000? It's a strong offer.",680000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $680,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference at $715,000. This price is a good compromise, and it allows us both to move forward.",715000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I could stretch my budget to $700,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  It's a fair offer considering John's offer.",700000.0,Bob,6,
