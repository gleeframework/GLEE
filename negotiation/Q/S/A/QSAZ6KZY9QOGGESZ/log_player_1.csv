Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you won't lose money and allows for potential profit. 
* **It's a good starting point for negotiation:** You can adjust your counteroffers based on Bob's responses. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes that you want to maximize your profit. If you want to prioritize a quick sale or a strong relationship with Bob, you might consider a lower initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product and believe it has value. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit.  There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get closer to your target price. 

* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.** You can try to meet in the middle or push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but you might miss out on a potential higher price from Bob.**  You'll need to balance this risk against your desire to maximize profits.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you keep the negotiation open and have a chance to improve your position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is halfway between your last offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to consider your offer seriously.
* **Still above your minimum:** You're still above your $15,000 floor, ensuring that you won't lose money. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes your willingness to negotiate, creating a more positive atmosphere.

By making a counteroffer, you continue the negotiation and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I'm not comfortable at $13,500, I'd like to make one final offer of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has now made his final offer, and it's stuck at $13,000, which is below your minimum desired price. While there's a possibility of further negotiation, there's also a risk of getting stuck in a loop where you keep going back and forth.

Considering the following:

* **John's offer:** You have a guaranteed $15,000 from John.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob could be time-consuming and emotionally draining, especially since you're close to your minimum price.
* **Potential for a stalemate:**  Bob might not be willing to budge further, and you could end up with a deal you're not happy with.

Therefore, it's strategically advantageous to take John's offer and sell the product for $15,000. This ensures a profitable outcome and avoids the potential downsides of further negotiation."
