"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $105. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. ",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $118?",118.0,Alice,5,
