"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  While $117.50 is closer, I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Could we do $110? That's a pretty good offer.",110.0,Bob,4,
