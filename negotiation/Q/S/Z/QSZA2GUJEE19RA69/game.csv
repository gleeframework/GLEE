"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and agree on $875,000? Let's get this deal done!",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
