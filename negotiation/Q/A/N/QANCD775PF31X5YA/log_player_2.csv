"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility. This offer is also closer to our walk-away point, giving us room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $12,500?  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but the offer is still above our target price and what John is offering. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Could we meet in the middle at $11,250?"",
""product_price"": 11250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are proposing a compromise price that is exactly halfway between Alice's last offer and our previous counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and move closer to her price, but still keeps us below our maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,250 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $13,000. Let's meet halfway at $12,625.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is firm on her price and it's clear she won't go below $12,500.  Since we can get the product for $12,000 from John, it's no longer worth continuing the negotiation. It's time to exercise our walk-away option."
