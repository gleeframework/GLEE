Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,500 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he's likely to be interested in this offer. 

By starting with this offer, you maximize your potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $13,500?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum, it's still below your initial asking price. You have a chance to get closer to your desired price. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is still above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Is closer to your ideal price:** You're getting closer to your desired price without being too aggressive.
* **Is a reasonable compromise:**  It's halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.

By using this strategy, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate while also ensuring you don't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $13,750. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,750 is very close to your desired price and is a good compromise. While you could potentially continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal entirely is increasing. Accepting this offer ensures you secure a sale above your minimum threshold and leaves minimal room for further negotiations that could potentially result in a lower price or a rejected deal."
