"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1050000 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'll give you a slight discount, but I need $1050000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
