Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is increasing her price, but I'm still not ready to give in. I'm going to try another counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.  It's still early in the negotiation, and I want to explore all possibilities before resorting to buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting too close to John's price.  With only three rounds left, it's not worth risking a longer negotiation that could result in a higher price or no deal at all.  Buying from John ensures I get the product for a price I'm comfortable with, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible."
