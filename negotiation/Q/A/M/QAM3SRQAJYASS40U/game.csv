"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $900000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $875000.  This is a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value and my need to stay within budget. Let's find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about staying within budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $890000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $890000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to land on a price that works better for my budget. I'd like to offer $880000. This feels like a good compromise that allows us to both get what we need from this deal. What do you think?",880000.0,Bob,6,
