"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1200000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
