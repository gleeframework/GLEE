Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, but still above my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $160, which is still above my minimum acceptable value of $150. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell for his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price that's more favorable to me.  I'm willing to go lower than $160, but not as low as $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $140, which is still above my minimum acceptable value of $150. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my initial offer.  At this point, I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
