"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $800,000? This would be a great deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
