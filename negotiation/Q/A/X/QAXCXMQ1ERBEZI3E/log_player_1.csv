"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000.  This is a good starting point as it allows room for negotiation without immediately going too low. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product at a premium price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $17,500. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it shows a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob, considering his previous offer was significantly lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a better price in the next round.  I'm not ready to settle for less than my minimum yet, and I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or potentially John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $16,000. I'm trying to close the gap between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. I'm confident that this price is still a good deal for both of us and will hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still reach a better agreement with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $15,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe Bob is close to accepting. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and agree to this offer, rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob has come closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm running out of time, and the negotiation is getting increasingly difficult.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids further risk.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the sale."
