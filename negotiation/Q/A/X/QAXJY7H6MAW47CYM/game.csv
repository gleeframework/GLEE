"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. This product fits a specific need for me, and I'm working within a tight budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective and willingness to negotiate.  However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need us to find a more realistic middle ground. While I'm not prepared to meet your initial ask, I am willing to increase my offer to $725,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price point.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to make this deal work.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. However, there's still a significant gap between our positions. To be frank, if we can't agree on a price closer to $800,000, I'll need to seriously consider my other options. I'm willing to offer $775,000 as a final attempt to find a solution with you.
