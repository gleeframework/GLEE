"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  While $1,250,000 is a strong offer, the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This is a strong price, and I believe it reflects a good balance between our needs. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,
