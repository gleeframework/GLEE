"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you can still purchase the product from John, albeit at a higher price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  While $1,250,000 is a strong offer, the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Although she lowered her price, it's still above your desired price range and only slightly lower than your initial counteroffer. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can likely convince Alice to come down further by making another counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a risky fallback.** It would be much more expensive than buying from Alice, and you might be able to get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
