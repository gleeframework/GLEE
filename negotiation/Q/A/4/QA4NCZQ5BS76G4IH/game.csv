"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it holds equal value for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $850,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,
