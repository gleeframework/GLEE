"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am hoping for a lower price. Could we discuss something closer to $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle? I'd accept $1350000. This gives us both a good deal and ensures a smooth transaction.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussion, I would like to propose a price of $1300000.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1300000 is still a little lower than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference this time?  I'm willing to go down to $1325000.  That's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
