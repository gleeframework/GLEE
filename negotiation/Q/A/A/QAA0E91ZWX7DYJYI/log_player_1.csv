Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price well above our minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob, justifying the high price. 

**Why not ask for the full $1,200,000?**

While tempting, it's generally not a good negotiation tactic to start at the absolute highest price. It leaves no room for negotiation and might make Bob feel like he's being taken advantage of, even if the price is objectively fair."
