"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer is equal to the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($15,000), I will accept his offer.
