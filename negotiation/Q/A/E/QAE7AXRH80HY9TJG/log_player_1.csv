Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price. 
* **Secure a Deal:**  While we have a backup offer, selling to Bob at this price point is significantly more profitable than John's $12,000 offer."
