"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. However, I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its market value and the value it holds for me.  To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects its true worth. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still outside my price range. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  Since John is offering the product for my target price of $1,000,000, it makes more sense to secure the deal with him and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
