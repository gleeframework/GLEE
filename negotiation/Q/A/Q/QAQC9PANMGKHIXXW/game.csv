"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still below what I need to move forward.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This gives us both a good deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would that work for you?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle on $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise for both of us. ",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. How about we make this the final offer: $1,160,000.  This keeps us both relatively close to our desired prices.",1160000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I understand we're getting close to a deal.  I'm willing to go down to $1,165,000. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.  Let's make this happen.",1165000.0,Alice,7,
