"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be interested in taking it at that price?",14000.0,Alice,3,
