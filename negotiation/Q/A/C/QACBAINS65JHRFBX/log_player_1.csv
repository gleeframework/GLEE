Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin over my minimum price of $100 while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  I'll be watching his response carefully and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (or lack thereof)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is better than selling to John, but it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this price is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still gives me a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is pretty close to my desired price. While I could keep negotiating, there's a chance I'll end up with a lower price, or even lose the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and avoids further risk."
