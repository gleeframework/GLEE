"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $8,000. It's significantly below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $10,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
