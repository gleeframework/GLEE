Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating its worth to you, the message hints at the product's value, which might make Bob more amenable to a higher price.
* **Alternative:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable given the product's worth to him."
