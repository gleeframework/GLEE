,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $85 is closer to my price. However, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $86. I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",86.0,Bob,4,
