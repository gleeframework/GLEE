Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but leaves you room for profit. Since you have a backup offer, you can afford to start higher.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's positive and positions the product based on value, not just price. 
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. 
    * It's significantly less than your minimum but still leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down.
    * It's substantially more than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Having John as a backup gives you strength in the negotiation.
* **Relationship:** While aiming for the best price, consider your long-term relationship with Bob. A slightly lower price might be worthwhile if it leads to future business."
