"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  He's offering $8,500, which is $1,000 less than Alice's offer. This is a significant discount, but still leaves Alice with a profit of $500.  This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still lower than John's $10,000 price. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's likely that further negotiation will be more time-consuming and may not result in a significantly lower price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase at a good price with minimal risk."
