"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's  worth exploring negotiation with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $8,000 offer is a strong starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's budget. There's room for further negotiation, and it's worth exploring those possibilities before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but still trying to save as much money as possible.  A $9,000 offer represents a significant compromise from Bob's initial counteroffer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.  This also leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  There are still rounds left, and Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his limit, but there's still a chance to get a slightly better price. A counteroffer of $9,500 shows Bob's willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. This puts pressure on Alice to either accept or make a very small counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting close to Bob's budget but it's still above the $10,000 limit he set for himself.  With only a few rounds left, the risk of failing to reach an agreement is high. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget."
