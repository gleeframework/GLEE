"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $775,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter-offer. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground here, but that price is still a bit high for me. How about we try $700,000? I think that's a fair reflection of the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $725,000 is closer, I'm still hesitant to go that high.  My final offer is $710,000.  I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. ",710000.0,Bob,6,
