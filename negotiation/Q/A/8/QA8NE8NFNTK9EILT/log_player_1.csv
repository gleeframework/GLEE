Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the negotiation dynamics:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down. 
* **Emphasize Value:** The message highlights the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential"" to justify the higher price.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you can tailor your message accordingly. 
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have John as a backup, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is beneficial for future business opportunities.

This offer balances assertiveness with the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
