"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is close to my limit, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and propose a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:**  My message maintains a polite and friendly tone while clearly stating my price target. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By aiming for $110, I'm closer to my ideal price while still leaving space to negotiate up if needed before I hit my $150 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $140 is my initial asking price, I could meet you halfway at $125. This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $125 is still above my target price. There's room for further negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle on $115? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate and meet her closer to the middle ground. 
* **Justification:** By positioning $115 as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm implying it's a reasonable request.
* **Pressure:**  While I'm still negotiating, I'm getting closer to my walk-away point of $150. This offer should encourage Alice to consider a price closer to my desired range."
