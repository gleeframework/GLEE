"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering my budget and what I've researched about similar products.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $1600000. It's a fair middle ground that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
