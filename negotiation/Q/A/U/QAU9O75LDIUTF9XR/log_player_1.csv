"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to us, but I need to see a price that reflects its actual worth in our current market. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $1,000,000. That's significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price. I still have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and I can always sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  It's crucial we find a compromise that respects both our needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, acknowledging the value it holds for your company. This offer reflects a significant discount from my initial proposal, and I hope you'll see it as a fair starting point for further discussion.  Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but we're still quite a ways apart on this.  To be frank, anything above $1,200,000 just isn't going to work for my budget.  I'm confident this product can bring us mutual success, but I need a price that makes sense for us right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000 and get this deal done? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,500,000. I have several rounds remaining and I can always sell to John."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects a substantial concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to close this deal and ensure both of our businesses benefit."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to understand that $1,400,000 is really pushing my limit. This purchase needs to make financial sense for us, and I can't go any higher than $1,250,000.  I'm demonstrating my seriousness by holding firm here. Let's find an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution, but $1,250,000 unfortunately doesn't work for me. We're getting closer, but we still need to find a price that reflects the value of this product for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer is a sincere attempt to bridge the gap, and I hope you'll see it as a sign of my willingness to make this deal happen. Let's keep talking and find a solution that benefits both our businesses."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I acknowledge your willingness to negotiate, but we need to be realistic.  $1,350,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable with.  My absolute limit is $1,275,000. This is a significant investment for us, and I need you to meet me halfway to make this work.  Let's close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've been willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I have only 2 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing a sale to John by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
