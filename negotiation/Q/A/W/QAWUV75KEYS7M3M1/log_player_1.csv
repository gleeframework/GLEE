Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $8,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving a bit on the price Alice.  To be honest, $10,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.

Bob is unlikely to go any higher than his last offer. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
