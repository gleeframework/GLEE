Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000.  It's a unique item I believe you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Gauging Interest:** The $20,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). His response will reveal how interested he is and provide insight into his potential price ceiling. 
* **Potential for Profit Maximization:** If Bob accepts the $20,000, you maximize your profit. If he negotiates down, you can still aim for a price higher than $15,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have time for potential negotiation with Bob before finalizing the sale to John."
