"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, you can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I've already given you a discount from my initial price. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $115 is still within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either reject your counteroffer or walk away from the deal entirely. Accepting the offer guarantees you get the product at a price you're comfortable with, and it's better than having to pay John $150."
