"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I see the value in your product, $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $11500 for it.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $11500 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12250? This leaves some room for negotiation, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12250 is still a bit more than I can manage right now. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to pay $12000, which is the maximum I'm able to spend. I hope you can consider this final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
