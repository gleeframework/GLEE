Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I can still try to get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,200,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a substantial profit for you. If we can't reach an agreement on this price, I might have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,500,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer of $1,300,000. It's closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to sell it for that price yet. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but we're nearing the end of the rounds, and I'm worried about getting a much lower price if I keep negotiating.  John is offering a guaranteed price of $1,500,000, which is my minimum. It's the most sensible choice at this point."
