{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

By rejecting, you can explore a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and to potentially force her to make a more reasonable offer in the next round.
* **Room for Compromise:** While $350,000 is a substantial reduction, it still leaves room for potential negotiation and compromise.

By making a bold counteroffer, I'm aiming to establish a baseline for negotiation and push for a more favorable price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility:** While she rejected my aggressive counteroffer, she has come down from her initial price. This is a positive sign.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  $400,000 is still higher than my counteroffer, but there's room to potentially close the gap. 

By rejecting, I can continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 375000}

* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge if Alice is willing to meet me closer to the middle ground.

This approach aims to find a compromise point while still maintaining leverage in the negotiation."

**Reasoning:**

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer represents a midpoint between Alice's current offer ($425,000) and my previous offer ($375,000).  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Increasing the Pressure:**  By coming closer to her offer, I'm putting pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal. I'm also signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit.

I believe this counteroffer is a good compromise while still maintaining a strong negotiating position."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mirroring Alice's Last Offer:** By mirroring Alice's previous offer, I'm showing her that I'm willing to meet her halfway and close the gap. 
* **Pressure to Accept:** This counteroffer puts the ball in Alice's court. If she wants to avoid going to another round, she needs to seriously consider accepting this price. 
* **Limited Time:**  With only two rounds left, I'm  running out of time to negotiate. This makes it crucial to secure a deal.

This counteroffer is designed to increase the pressure and push for a quick resolution."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are in the 9th round, leaving only one round left for negotiation.  
* **Alice's Offer is High:**  $475,000 is still significantly higher than my desired price.  
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  There's a high chance Alice might reject my next counteroffer, leading to a stalemate.

With only one round remaining and Alice's price remaining high, the risk of not securing the product is too great. It's more prudent to buy from John at this point, even though it's a higher price. This guarantees I get the product, even if it's not the best deal."
