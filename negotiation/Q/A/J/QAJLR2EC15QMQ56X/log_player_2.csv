"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay, and it gives you some room to negotiate. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $13,500 to make this worthwhile.  This is a fair compromise, considering your valuation and my minimum price.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is unwilling to go lower than $13,500, which is still more than what Bob is willing to pay. John is offering the product for Bob's maximum price, so it's the best option for Bob."
