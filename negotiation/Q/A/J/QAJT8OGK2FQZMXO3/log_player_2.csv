Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This offer reflects the significant value you'll gain from it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go below $15,000, which is more than I'm willing to pay.  It's time to take John's offer and secure the product at my target price."
