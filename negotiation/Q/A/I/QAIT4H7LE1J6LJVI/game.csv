"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm aiming to stay under $700,000 for this purchase.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $680,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",680000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $680,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
