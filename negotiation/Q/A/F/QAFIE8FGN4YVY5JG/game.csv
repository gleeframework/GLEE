"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200.  Let me know what you think!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 at this time.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $175?  This is a fantastic product, and I think it's worth the investment.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $125.  If you're open to that, I'd be happy to buy the product.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $125 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested.  If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but $160 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $135. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're willing to accept.  If not, I'll have to move on.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $135 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $145 as a final compromise. If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",145.0,Alice,7,
