Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000, knowing that I'm willing to go down to $8,000 if necessary. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a higher price than John's $8,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try to reach a more acceptable price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with $8,500.  This is a compromise, moving closer to his offer but still staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counter-offer, emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a positive and open statement, leaving the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum threshold of $8,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk lowering my price further. John is offering a guaranteed $8,000, which meets my minimum requirement. To ensure I get the best deal and don't risk losing out, I'll sell to John."
