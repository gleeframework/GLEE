"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $12,000 to you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify $13,000.  Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to be more flexible. I'll offer you the product for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
