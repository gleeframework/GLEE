Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, I'm setting a high anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's more likely the final price will be closer to my desired range.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John is waiting with a $1,500,000 offer provides leverage.  I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value is not as high as what you're asking. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While closer to his perceived value, it's still a substantial difference from my target.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not to accept such a low offer when I have John as a guaranteed backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept anything below $1,800,000."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I've lowered my price to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Significant but Gradual:** The decrease is substantial enough to hopefully encourage Bob but still keeps me well above both his offer and my minimum.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm holding firm above John's offer, ensuring I don't lose potential profit by negotiating too low, too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now greater than John's standing offer of $1,500,000. It makes financial sense to accept Bob's offer.
* **Strong Negotiation:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging negotiations could lead to missed opportunities or delays. Accepting now allows me to move forward."
