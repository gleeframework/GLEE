"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $8,000 is quite low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $12,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $12,000, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $11,000? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you've reached your limit, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. It's a bit above your maximum, but I'm willing to compromise to close the deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
