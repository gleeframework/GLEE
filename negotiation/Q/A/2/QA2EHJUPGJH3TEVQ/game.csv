"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a great product, but I'm not sure if it's worth the full $1500000. Can you meet me at this price or is there some flexibility in your offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I've had other interested buyers and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'd like to know if you can meet me at this price or if we can discuss further.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1300000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still not sure if the product is worth $1300000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1300000, which would be $1275000. Can you consider this offer or is it still too low for you?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1275000. I can offer it to you for $1290000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1290000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we've been able to find some common ground. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1280000, which is the last concession I'm willing to make. If you're willing to sell it to me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",1280000.0,Bob,8,

"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make one last concession. However, I've already given you a good discount from my original price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I can offer it to you for $1290000, which is the same price I offered in round 7. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",1290000.0,Alice,9,
