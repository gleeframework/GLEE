"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so she is making a profit of $4,000. If I accept her offer, I will be paying $14,000, which is $4,000 more than its worth to her. I can get the product from John for $15,000, which is only $1,000 more than Alice's offer. However, I can save $1,000 by buying from Alice, so I will reject her offer and buy the product from John.
