"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate upwards from his initial offer. We are still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate while remaining profitable."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is moving slowly, but he is still moving upwards.  We are getting close to the point where we need to consider if the additional potential profit from Bob is worth the risk of him walking away. We'll push a little further but be ready to accept in the next round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. This is my final offer, take it or leave it: $872,000."", 
""product_price"": 872000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to apply pressure and signal that this is the end of the road in terms of negotiating the price down.  This offer gives Bob a small concession while still keeping a significant margin above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. I would like to counter with $865,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $865,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $865,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Accepting Bob's offer at $865,000 is the best course of action. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:**  $865,000 is significantly higher than John's standing offer of $800,000. Accepting this offer secures a solid profit. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  We've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation increases the risk of Bob losing interest or finding alternative options.  Closing the deal now secures the profit."
