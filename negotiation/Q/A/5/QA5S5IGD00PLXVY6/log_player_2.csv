"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This signals his willingness to negotiate, but also establishes a clear boundary for what he's willing to pay.  It's a reasonable starting point, and he has room to potentially increase his offer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $11,000 is still higher than Bob's limit of $8,000. He has room to negotiate further, especially since he has the option of buying from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, showing willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is a reasonable midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's current offer.  It's also still within his budget, leaving room for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,500 is close, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum limit of $8,000.  While there's a possibility of further negotiation, Bob has already been through several rounds and it's unclear if Alice is willing to go lower.  Given that John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product at that price rather than risk further negotiation that could fail or take more time."
