Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to go, and it's still below my minimum.  There's no point in further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
