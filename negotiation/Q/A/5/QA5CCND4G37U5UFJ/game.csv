"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
