"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. Let's work together and reach an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $15,750.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",15750.0,Bob,4,
