Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. Let's work together and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $15,750.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $15,750 is a good offer and a fair compromise. There's a good chance that Bob won't budge further, and I'm not sure I want to risk losing the deal altogether."
