"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're confident in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering your value for the product and my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $10,500. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me.",10800.0,Alice,5,
