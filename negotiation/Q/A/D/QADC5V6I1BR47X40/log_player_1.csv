{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value of $120 while still being attractive to Bob.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll try to get a bit closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $95? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, but I think I can do better than $95. How about $85? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would like to continue negotiating with Bob,  his offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum value of $120.  I'm better off selling to John for $120, as this guarantees I reach my minimum profit."
