Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:** Bob's counteroffer is now at his maximum price. This is a bold move as it demonstrates a commitment to reaching a deal while also leaving no room for further concessions.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:** Alice's offer is still too high.  There is only one round left, and  it's highly unlikely Alice will accept Bob's maximum price of $100.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John at this point.  While it's not the lowest possible price, it saves further negotiation time and ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
