{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a valuable asset that I believe would be a great addition to your business. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum price:**  This shows you're confident in the product's value while leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer, as he knows he can get it for less than what it's worth to him.

Remember, this is just the first step in the negotiation. We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell it for that price yet. I want to see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get for this valuable product. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:** It meets Bob halfway, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterates the value:** It reminds Bob of the product's worth to justify the price. 
* **Keeps the pressure on:** It doesn't go too low and allows for potential further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,350,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for $1,250,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm determined to get closer to my target price. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. This product is truly unique and offers significant benefits that are worth more than that. How about we compromise at $1,300,000? It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while still allowing you a good deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **Compromises further:** It's closer to Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to close the deal.
* **Highlights the value again:** It reminds Bob of the product's benefits to justify the price.
* **Sets a firm limit:** It's close to my minimum, but still leaves room for a small concession if needed. 

I'm hoping this will be the final offer and lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $1,000,000.  While I'd like to get a better price, I'm not willing to keep negotiating with Bob at this point.  I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer and I'm happy to secure the sale for $1,000,000."
