"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a valuable asset that I believe would be a great addition to your business. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get for this valuable product. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,350,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. This product is truly unique and offers significant benefits that are worth more than that. How about we compromise at $1,300,000? It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while still allowing you a good deal. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
