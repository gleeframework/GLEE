{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're interested, let me know.  Otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired earnings. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price. I'll aim for something slightly lower than my previous offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? It's a fair price that we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 8750}
