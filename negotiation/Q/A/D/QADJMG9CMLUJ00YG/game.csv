"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're interested, let me know.  Otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? It's a fair price that we can both be happy with.",8750.0,Alice,5,
