"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Building Rapport:**  The message aims to establish a friendly tone and emphasize Bob's potential benefit from the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:** This price allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest, and there's still room for negotiation.  
* **Keeping Options Open:** Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** The message maintains a friendly tone and invites Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still looking to keep my costs down. I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob is increasing his offer, which shows a willingness to compromise.  
* **Keeping Options Open:** By rejecting the offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust negotiation possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a good price, and I appreciate that. While $125 is closer, it's still a little low for me.  How about $128?  It's a small step closer to your offer and would help me make this work. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  My counteroffer is a smaller step closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but not drastically lowering my price.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  The message highlights the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining a Friendly Tone:**  I aim to keep the communication positive and encouraging to avoid a breakdown in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $127. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $127 is still below my preferred price, but it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a missed opportunity.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  While $127 is a bit less than I'd like,  accepting this offer could lead to future deals with Bob if he values the product. 
* **Avoiding John's Deal:**  Selling to John for $150 would be safer, but I'm prioritizing potential future business with Bob."
