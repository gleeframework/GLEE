"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $11,500 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still offers you a great deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $13,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another offer. I'm willing to pay $12,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",12800.0,Bob,4,
