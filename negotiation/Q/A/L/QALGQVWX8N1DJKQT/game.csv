"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. I'm confident this deal would be mutually beneficial.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, given the product's unique features and the market value, I believe we can achieve a more equitable transaction. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $1,300,000. This price still allows for a significant profit margin while ensuring you receive a fair return on your investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
