"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the value the product brings to Bob's business to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm aware Bob might not accept this first offer, so I'm leaving room for negotiations in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I have the option of selling to John for a much better price. 
* **Strategic play:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show him that I'm serious about getting a fair price and not willing to settle for a lowball offer. This might encourage him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value this product brings. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (somewhat):** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but not to cave in.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, hoping to sway him towards a higher price. 
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation productive. 

I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer. This strategy allows me to potentially reach a higher price with Bob while keeping my options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not yet willing to settle.
* **Strategic negotiation:** I want to continue to push for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not under pressure to sell to Bob immediately.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a secure option. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a lower profit.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm determined to get a better price. This might motivate Bob to make a more attractive offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your latest offer, $1,450,000 still falls short of my expectations. Given the product's potential value to your business, I'm willing to compromise and offer it for $1,550,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost there:** I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob and emphasizing the discount from my initial offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us"" to make it more appealing and encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer is a strategic move. It shows Bob I'm serious about a deal but not willing to cave in, potentially prompting him to accept or make a final counteroffer closer to my desired price.  If he rejects again, I have the option to sell to John, ensuring I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. However, I'd like to propose a payment plan to make it more manageable for my business. Would you be open to discussing a payment plan? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Even though he's proposing a payment plan, I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me.
* **Payment plan uncertainty:** A payment plan introduces complexity and potential risks. I don't have enough information about Bob's payment plan to assess its feasibility and security.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a secure option without any payment plan complications.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. If he's truly interested, he might be willing to raise his offer or consider a more attractive payment plan."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to explore a payment plan. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me. To move forward, I'd need to see a concrete payment plan that makes financial sense for both of us.  If you're willing to offer a price closer to $1,500,000 with a feasible payment plan, I'm open to discussing it further. Otherwise, I'm going to have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm on price:** I'm maintaining my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to go lower, especially since I can sell to John for that amount.
* **Payment plan condition:** I'm turning the focus to the payment plan. I'm open to discussing it but only if the price is closer to my minimum.
* **Clear ultimatum:**  I'm giving Bob a clear ultimatum â€“ he needs to offer a better price and a workable payment plan to continue the negotiation. 

This strategy is designed to pressure Bob to make a more appealing offer. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to walk away and secure the deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, and I'd like to reiterate my request for a payment plan. Additionally, I'd like to offer a bonus of $5,000 to make the deal more attractive. Can we discuss a payment plan that works for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Despite the bonus, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** We're nearing the end of our rounds, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Secure alternative:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

While a payment plan could be beneficial, the bonus is insufficient to compensate for the price difference.  The risk of further negotiation and the possibility of not reaching an agreement is too high, and I'm better off securing the deal with John."
