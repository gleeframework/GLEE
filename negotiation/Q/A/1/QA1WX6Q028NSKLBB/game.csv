"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value this product brings. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. Can we discuss further?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your latest offer, $1,450,000 still falls short of my expectations. Given the product's potential value to your business, I'm willing to compromise and offer it for $1,550,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. However, I'd like to propose a payment plan to make it more manageable for my business. Would you be open to discussing a payment plan?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to explore a payment plan. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me. To move forward, I'd need to see a concrete payment plan that makes financial sense for both of us.  If you're willing to offer a price closer to $1,500,000 with a feasible payment plan, I'm open to discussing it further. Otherwise, I'm going to have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, and I'd like to reiterate my request for a payment plan. Additionally, I'd like to offer a bonus of $5,000 to make the deal more attractive. Can we discuss a payment plan that works for both of us?",1450000.0,Bob,8,
