Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy involved:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to negotiate down from a higher price. 
* **Value justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high asking price. 
* **Open for negotiation:** The tone is not overly aggressive but invites Bob to engage in discussion.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** Bob knows the product is valuable to him, but he'll also want a fair deal. A significantly inflated price might make him walk away, even if he's highly interested. 
* **Your backup:** The safety net of John's offer allows you to be bolder in your initial ask.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. You could experiment with different price points and messaging strategies."
