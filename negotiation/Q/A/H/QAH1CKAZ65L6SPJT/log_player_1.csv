"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) but still below Bob's perceived value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate and leaves Bob feeling like he can get a good deal.
* **Positive message:** A friendly and positive message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  While $10,000 is higher than my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate closer to my desired price. Bob's offer shows he's interested and willing to pay.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer. This demonstrates that I'm not desperate and willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Avoiding selling to John:** Selling to John for $8,000 would be a guaranteed outcome, but it would be a lower profit. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer,  I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $11,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Reiterating value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to further justify my price point.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm not dropping it drastically. This maintains pressure on Bob to reach a deal closer to my desired price."
