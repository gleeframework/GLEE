"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated. Let's try $1,075,000. This is a compromise, but I think it's a good price for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
