**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly hovering above your maximum price and even increased her offer from the previous round. It's unlikely she'll come down significantly in the remaining rounds.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, which saves you money and avoids further negotiation risk."
