"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal and I'm confident it will be very valuable to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $18,000, significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value to Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is high enough to potentially trigger a counteroffer from Bob, allowing for back-and-forth bargaining. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's initial counteroffer is unacceptable, his message indicates he's interested in the product.  This means there's potential for a compromise.
* **Room to Counter:** I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and cooperative approach to keep the negotiation going.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to make my price seem more reasonable. 
* **Room for Agreement:**  I've left some room for further negotiation if Bob counters again.  

**Note:**  If this counteroffer is rejected, I'll be more willing to consider selling to John in the next round, as Bob is showing a reluctance to meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11000? It's a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's message suggests he's willing to negotiate further. There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, there's a good chance of getting a higher price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer with a price slightly above $11,000, aiming for a final deal that's as close to my desired price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $11,000 is definitely closer to where I need to be.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go down to $11,500.  This allows me to make a reasonable profit and gives you a great value on the product.  I'm hoping we can agree on this, so we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm making a small concession, going down to $11,500. This shows Bob I'm willing to meet him halfway, but still maintain a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm remaining optimistic and friendly, hoping to close the deal.

**Thinking Ahead:** 

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $12,000.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10750?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,750 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited Negotiation:** We're already on Round 6, and there are only four rounds left. Continuing to negotiate carries a risk of getting a lower price or not reaching an agreement at all. 
* **Safe Option:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids further potential losses in the negotiation. 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of getting stuck with a lower offer or losing time in the limited rounds outweighs the potential for a better deal with Bob."
