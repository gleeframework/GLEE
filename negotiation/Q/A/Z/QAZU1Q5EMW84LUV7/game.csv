"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. I believe it's a great deal and I'm confident it will be very valuable to you. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14000.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11000? It's a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $11000 is definitely closer to where I need to be.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go down to $11500.  This allows me to make a reasonable profit and gives you a great value on the product.  I'm hoping we can agree on this, so we can both be happy with the outcome.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10750?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,6,
