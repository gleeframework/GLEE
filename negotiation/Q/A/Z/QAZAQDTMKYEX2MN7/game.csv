"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to my original offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1,375,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. While I value your business, I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000.  Let's try $1,390,000. This is a final compromise on my end.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",1390000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Alice, but $1,390,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,380,000, but no higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1,500,000.",1380000.0,Bob,6,
