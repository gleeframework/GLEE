"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $500000 for the product, considering its potential value. This reflects a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500000 is simply too low for this product. I'm willing to compromise, however. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1000000. This price reflects the value I've placed on it, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1000000 is still out of my price range. Let's try $700000. This is a significant investment for me, and it's the highest I can go at this point. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your financial constraints. While $700000 is closer, it's still not quite there.  Let's try $850000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and allows for a comfortable margin for both of us.  Think of it as an opportunity to secure a valuable asset at a price that's within your reach.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly value your flexibility in negotiations. However, $850000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is the maximum I can offer without exceeding my financial limits. I believe this price is fair, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to be closer to my desired price.  Let's try $900000. This is a fair compromise that accounts for the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm confident we can find a solution that satisfies both of our needs.",900000.0,Alice,7,
