# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. Let me know your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's important to establish a lower baseline before considering a purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product, considering its potential value. This reflects a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500000 is simply too low for this product. I'm willing to compromise, however. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1000000. This price reflects the value I've placed on it, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget.  I need to keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still out of my price range. Let's try $700,000. This is a significant investment for me, and it's the highest I can go at this point. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your financial constraints. While $700000 is closer, it's still not quite there.  Let's try $850000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and allows for a comfortable margin for both of us.  Think of it as an opportunity to secure a valuable asset at a price that's within your reach. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer, $850,000 is still too high for my budget. I want to see if I can get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly value your flexibility in negotiations. However, $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is the maximum I can offer without exceeding my financial limits. I believe this price is fair, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to be closer to my desired price.  Let's try $900000. This is a fair compromise that accounts for the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm confident we can find a solution that satisfies both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging on the price.  Even though there are still a few rounds left, it's not worth risking going further and potentially losing out on the product.  John's offer is my best option at this point."
