I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000 from John, but I believe there's a good chance Bob will be willing to pay more.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for higher profits:**  I'm aiming for a substantial profit, and it's worth taking a risk.
* **Unknown value to Bob:**  I don't know the product's value to Bob, so this offer creates a potentially advantageous situation for me.
* **Worst-case scenario:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John and secure my minimum profit. 

I'm cautiously optimistic that this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
