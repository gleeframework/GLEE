"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, the product's true worth is reflected closer to my initial price. How about we meet halfway at $1,875,000?",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,875,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference at $1,800,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
