Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's very interested, getting you closer to your maximum possible profit.
* **Balance with Attractiveness:** While you could start higher, there's a risk of alienating Bob. This offer is a good balance between being attractive to him while still aiming for a significant profit."
