Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below $90. I'll send him a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe the product is worth more than $85. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $87.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $87.50 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $82.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is getting closer to my price, but I've already gone down as far as I'm comfortable with.  Since I can get $100 from John, I'm going to sell to him instead."
