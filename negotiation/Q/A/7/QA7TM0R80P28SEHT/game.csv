"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. Considering your offer of $6,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise that I hope you'll find acceptable.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price that I hope you'll find acceptable.",8200.0,Alice,5,
