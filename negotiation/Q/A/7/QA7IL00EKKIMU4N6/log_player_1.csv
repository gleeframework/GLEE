Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,200,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal ($100,000 less than his perceived value) while still maximizing your profit.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer. 

By starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value, you increase the chances of closing a deal quickly and securing a significant profit."
