Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering Bob a price that's $100,000 higher than my guaranteed minimum from John. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it also reflects the value I place on the product. 

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Higher price:**  I want to maximize my profit, so starting high is a good strategy. 
* **Not too high:** I don't want to scare Bob off immediately.  
* **Negotiation room:** There's space for Bob to counter-offer without me feeling like I'm being taken advantage of.

I'll need to be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
