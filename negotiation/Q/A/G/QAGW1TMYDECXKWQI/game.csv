"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a great price for a fantastic product like this.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice. While the product looks great, $90 is still a little more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $85? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
