Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $85? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, her latest offer of $85 is still higher than John's fixed price of $80.  It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and secure the best possible price."
