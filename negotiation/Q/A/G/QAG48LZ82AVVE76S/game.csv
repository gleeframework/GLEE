"Hi Alice, $145 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140?  That's still a great deal for you and a fair price for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $135.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $135 is still just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $137.50?  This way, we both get something we can be happy with.",137.5,Alice,5,
