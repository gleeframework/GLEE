"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $145. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $145, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer positively to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not going for the full $150 right away, as I want to leave space for potential counteroffers and a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $145 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There is still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140?  That's still a great deal for you and a fair price for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering $140, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I'm highlighting that this price is a good deal for both of us, encouraging a win-win scenario.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:**  I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm showing I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $135.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  He's showing a willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get him closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** I can always sell to John if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $135 is still just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $137.50?  This way, we both get something we can be happy with."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting that this offer benefits both of us, emphasizing a win-win situation.
* **Final push:**  I'm trying to push Bob towards my desired price, but I'm still open to negotiation if needed."
