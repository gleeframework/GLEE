"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. Can you consider a price of $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and willingness to pay a premium. After considering your offer, I am proposing a counteroffer of $12500. This price includes the same comprehensive warranty and lifetime support as before, and reflects a compromise between our initial offers. I hope this meets within your desired budget.",12500.0,Alice,3,
