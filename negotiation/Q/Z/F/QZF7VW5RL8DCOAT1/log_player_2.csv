"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal compared to the product's worth to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it can bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $900,000 is still out of Bob's budget.  There's still a chance that Alice might be willing to drop the price further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  However, if Alice's next counteroffer is still above $800,000, Bob should seriously consider buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to give you a small discount from my original offer, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is still above Bob's budget. It's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that Bob can afford. At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Continue negotiating:** This could lead to a successful deal, but it's risky. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and the negotiation could drag on, potentially costing Bob valuable time and energy.

2. **Buy from John:** This is the safer option. John is offering the product for $800,000, which is within Bob's budget.  While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a guaranteed deal that allows Bob to stay within his financial limits.

Considering the risk and the likelihood of further negotiation being unsuccessful, Bob should choose to buy from John."
