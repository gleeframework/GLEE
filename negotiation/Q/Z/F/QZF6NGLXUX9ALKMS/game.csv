"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product!",9500.0,Alice,5,
