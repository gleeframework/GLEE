Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product that I know you'll find valuable. I think a fair price would be $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $150, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80) and John's offer ($80).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This opening offer positions the product as valuable while still presenting an attractive deal for Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a deal with Bob, you could adjust the price higher or lower."
