"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a great opportunity to own something special, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know your thoughts!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment.",14500.0,Alice,3,
