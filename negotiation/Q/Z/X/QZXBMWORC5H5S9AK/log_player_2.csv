# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
