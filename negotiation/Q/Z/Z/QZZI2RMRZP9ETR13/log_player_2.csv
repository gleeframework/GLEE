Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $10000 for the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still out of my range.  I'm firm on $8,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}

Round 5
