"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. I believe it could greatly enhance your operations or personal use. Let's start by discussing a fair price. Would you consider purchasing it for $15000?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product,  $15000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $8000 for it. This is the maximum I can spend at this time.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $10000 for the product. This still reflects its high value, while making it more accessible to you. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10000 is still out of my range.  I'm firm on $8000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let me propose a compromise. How about $9500 for the product? This is a bit closer to your offer but still maintains a fair value for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",9500.0,Alice,5,
