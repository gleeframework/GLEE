Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too much for me.  How about $750,000?  That feels like a solid middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price point. It's still early in the negotiation, and we have room to negotiate further. Accepting $750,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to see a bit more movement to make this worthwhile for me.  Would you consider $850,000? That feels like a fair offer considering its unique value."",
""product_price"": 850000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, this product does have unique value.  To meet you halfway, I can offer $800,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. While we might be able to push for a bit more, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting $800,000 guarantees a good profit and avoids the potential loss of the deal."
