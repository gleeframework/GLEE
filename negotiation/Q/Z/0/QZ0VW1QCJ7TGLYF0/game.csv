"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too much for me.  How about $750,000?  That feels like a solid middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to see a bit more movement to make this worthwhile for me.  Would you consider $850,000? That feels like a fair offer considering its unique value.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, this product does have unique value.  To meet you halfway, I can offer $800,000. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
