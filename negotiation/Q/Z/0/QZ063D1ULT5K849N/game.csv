"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget is quite limited. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $1500000? I'm hoping to find a balance between the product's value and my financial constraints.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1700000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget concerns. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, given my current financial situation, I'm unable to accept $1700000. Would it be possible to consider $1600000 as a potential middle ground?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer a new price of $1650000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. However, I'm still not able to meet at $1650000. Considering the product's value and my financial constraints, would it be possible for us to agree on a price closer to $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
