"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and my own needs. Let's discuss!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from your original price, but I'm willing to pay a premium for a product like this.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This still gives you a significant benefit and allows me to reach a fair price. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to you. It's also a substantial amount for me, which means I'm serious about finding a solution. Let's make this deal happen!",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget limit, but $1,350,000 is still not enough for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals. Think about it - this deal would be a huge win for you, and it's just a small step away for me. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm offering $1,325,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,8,
