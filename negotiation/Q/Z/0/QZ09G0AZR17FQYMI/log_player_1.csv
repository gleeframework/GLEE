"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and my own needs. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off. This gives me room to negotiate down while still getting a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I want to keep the negotiation friendly and open to discussion.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value the product has for Bob, making it a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from your original price, but I'm willing to pay a premium for a product like this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a significant discount from my initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **No need to rush:** I still have 8 rounds left, so I'm not under pressure to accept this offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This still gives you a significant benefit and allows me to reach a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not sacrificing my minimum goal of $1,500,000.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him and how this price still offers him a good deal.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm keeping the conversation open for further negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to work towards an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **""Final Offer"" is a tactic:** While he claims it's his final offer, this is often a negotiation tactic to pressure me into accepting. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have 6 rounds left, so I can continue to explore a price that works for both of us.
* **John's offer is secure:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to you. It's also a substantial amount for me, which means I'm serious about finding a solution. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-tactic:** I'm addressing Bob's ""final offer"" tactic by making my own counter-offer and emphasizing that I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Moving closer:** This offer is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm showing I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making it a good investment.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and encouraging a solution-oriented approach."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** With 4 rounds remaining, I can continue to negotiate and try to push Bob closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell the product to John and receive $1,500,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget limit, but $1,350,000 is still not enough for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000.

Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one. This shows flexibility and willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Emphasizing the benefits:** I'm reminding Bob of the significant value he'd gain from the deal and emphasizing the small remaining gap between our positions.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm keeping the tone optimistic and urging Bob to close the deal. 

**Strategy:** 

With fewer rounds left, I'm trying to apply more pressure to encourage Bob to accept a price closer to my desired range. By offering a compromise and highlighting the potential benefits, I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm offering $1,325,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to two rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **No guarantee of agreement:** There's no guarantee that Bob will come up to my desired price in the final round.
* **John's offer is safe:** John has already agreed to pay $1,500,000, which is my minimum. It's a secure deal that guarantees I reach my desired profit.

**Conclusion:**  I've tried to negotiate a better price with Bob, but with limited time and his unwillingness to move much further, I'm better off taking John's offer. It's a safer and more reliable option that guarantees a successful outcome."
