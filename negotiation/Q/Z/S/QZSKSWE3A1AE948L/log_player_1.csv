"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move, but I believe the product is worth it. If Bob balks, I have room to negotiate downwards. However, I'm confident that my product's value justifies this starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  He's clearly interested and has shown a willingness to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm dropping the price to $950,000. This is a significant compromise, but I want to show Bob I'm serious about a deal. I still believe the product is worth more, but this offer demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to my minimum of $800,000. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering I'm nearing the halfway point of the negotiation.  I'll take the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential further price reductions."
