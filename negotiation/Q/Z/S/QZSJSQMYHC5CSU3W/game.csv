"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique product with significant potential. I believe it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I'm confident it can be equally valuable to you.  Let's start the conversation with a price of $1500000.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a great starting point.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential in this product, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is still a fair price given the potential I see.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident this product holds even more value for you than you realize.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000? It's a fair price, and it gives us both room to breathe.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still out of my range.  I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us, and I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to close the gap. I'm prepared to come down to $1050000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the true potential of this product for you.  Let's get this deal done.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm willing to go up to $975000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential I see in the product. Let's try to close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
