"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,500? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $14,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about $12,500? That's a substantial increase from my last offer and  moves us closer to a fair deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, but $12,500 is still below my desired price. How about we meet halfway again and go with $13,500?  This offers a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. ",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to stay within my budget. How about $12,800? That's a fair offer considering the value I place on it.",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $12,800 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference again and try $13,150. It's a small adjustment but brings us closer to a win-win situation.  What do you say?",13150.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. This is my final offer,  $12,900. It represents a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.",12900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer.  $12,900 is a good price, but I'm still hoping we can bridge the small gap.  How about $13,000?  This represents a final compromise from me, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal.",13000.0,Alice,9,
