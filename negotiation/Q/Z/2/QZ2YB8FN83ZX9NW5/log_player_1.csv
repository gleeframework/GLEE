"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also demonstrates that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better price."
