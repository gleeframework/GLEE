"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $120, but $110 is still above your desired price range.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.** This gives you a chance to get a better price from Alice. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  If you can't reach a deal with Alice, you can still purchase the product at your maximum price limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer reflects your desired price range.** You are willing to pay $120, but you want to get a better price.  Offering $100 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **This counter-offer shows you are serious about buying.** You are willing to negotiate and reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is within your acceptable price range.** While you prefer a lower price, $105 is still under your maximum of $120.
* **Accepting the offer avoids further negotiation.** This saves time and effort compared to continuing to haggle.
* **Buying from John is still an option if necessary.** However, Alice's current offer is a good deal, making it the preferred choice at this point."
