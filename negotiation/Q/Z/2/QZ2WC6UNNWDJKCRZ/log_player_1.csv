Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to earn a bit more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $149 is a strong starting point. It's just below my minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the ""great deal"" to entice Bob and focus on the perceived value rather than just the price."
