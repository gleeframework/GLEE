"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle on $10500?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9000. How about we try $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price point but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $10000. This is the best I can do, let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really close to making a decision, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $9800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
