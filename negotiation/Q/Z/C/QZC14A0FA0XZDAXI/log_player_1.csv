Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a good starting point considering the minimum value of the product to me is $100. This allows for some potential negotiation space while still ensuring I make a decent profit.  I'll assess Bob's response and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept Bob's initial offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if Bob is serious about purchasing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his rock-bottom price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer, and I'm not willing to sell for my minimum value.  It's clear that further negotiation with Bob won't result in a higher price. Selling to John for $100 ensures I don't lose any money and allows me to move on to other potential buyers."
