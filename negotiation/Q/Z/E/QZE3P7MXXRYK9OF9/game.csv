"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a little more to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,
