Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $12,500? That's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worth my time. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a final offer from me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's not the $11,000 you wanted, it's better than John's price.  Continuing to negotiate has a risk of Alice walking away."
