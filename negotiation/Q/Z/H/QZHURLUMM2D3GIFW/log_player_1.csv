This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in your product's value.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob allows you to aim for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000) while still offering him a good deal.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Adding a sense of urgency and exclusivity can encourage Bob to act quickly and make a decision. 

This offer aims to strike a balance: maximizing your profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
