"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is a significant step down from the value this product brings. Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle on $1,025,000? This represents a substantial discount from my original offer while acknowledging the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $950,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $950,000 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept.  My final offer is $985,000. This represents a significant discount on a product of this caliber.",985000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $985,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
