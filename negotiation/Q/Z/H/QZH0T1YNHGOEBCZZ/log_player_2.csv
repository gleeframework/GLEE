Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $870000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'm willing to meet you at $885000, which is just a small step back from my previous offer. This price still reflects the product's value and would be a fair deal for both of us. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's offer is only $15,000 lower than your previous offer.  The negotiations are getting close to a stalemate, and there's little room for further concessions.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continued negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a situation where both parties refuse to budge.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  It's becoming clear that the cost of further negotiation outweighs the potential savings.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at a fixed price, avoiding further risk and uncertainty. 

With only a few rounds left, it's better to lock in a deal with John and avoid the potential for a failed negotiation with Alice."
