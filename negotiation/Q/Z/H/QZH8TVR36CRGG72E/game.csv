"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Let me know if you can meet me in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects a significant discount and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the revised offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than $10,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,750. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
