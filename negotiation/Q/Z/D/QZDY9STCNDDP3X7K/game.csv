"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth and potential for a profitable return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still very far apart on price.  I can appreciate the product's value, but $2,000,000 is not feasible for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price point.  To be straightforward, $1,500,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go for this product. I have another buyer ready at that price, but I believe you would benefit greatly from its acquisition and would prefer to see it in your hands.  What are your thoughts on this final offer?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
