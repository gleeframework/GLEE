Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to split the difference that far. I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll sell it to you for $825,000. However, I need to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer, so I'll actually sell it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down on price, she's playing a tough game. Her ""final offer"" and attempt to disguise the lack of change from her previous offer indicate she's unlikely to go much lower.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, saving you stress and potential further haggling."
