"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $1,000,000 to make it work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While your initial offer is below what I can accept, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle - how about we consider $1,700,000? This reflects the true value of the product's capabilities.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a big stretch for me. I could potentially do $1,250,000 if that works for you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum I need to reach for this deal to make sense for me.  Would you be willing to consider $1,450,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, my absolute maximum is $1,300,000. If you can't meet that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
