Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential profit margin of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk Bob might reject the offer.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its worth in the market. "",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It positions the product as valuable and uses framing (""fair,"" ""reflects its worth"") to make the price seem reasonable.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion ($150,000) of the potential profit margin while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($50,000).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower the price to increase your chances of securing the deal.
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly lower price could build goodwill.
