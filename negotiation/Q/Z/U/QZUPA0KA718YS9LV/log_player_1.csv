Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product's value is $1,500,000 to both you (the minimum you'd accept) and Bob, there's room for negotiation.  Starting significantly higher leaves space for potential concessions while aiming for a maximum profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, encouraging Bob to consider its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open and invites Bob to engage in discussion rather than presenting a non-negotiable offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your absolute bottom line.  If he knew you'd accept $1,500,000, he'd never offer more.  Negotiation is about finding a mutually agreeable price within a range."
