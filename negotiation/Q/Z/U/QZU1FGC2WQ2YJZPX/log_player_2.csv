"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than its intrinsic value. Given its significance to you, I propose a price of $95 for the product. This offer allows us both to benefit: you get a valuable item at a reasonable price, and I secure a fair return for my investment. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

I'm rejecting Alice's offer because $95 is still above my maximum price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  However, $95 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
