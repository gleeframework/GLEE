"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $8500? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $7000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to purchasing it. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $7000. How about we meet you halfway from $8000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to consider? I'm willing to sell it to you for $8000, but that's as low as I can go.",8000.0,Alice,5,
