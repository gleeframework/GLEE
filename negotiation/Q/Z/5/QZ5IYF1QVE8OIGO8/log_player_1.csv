Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm getting close to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  While $1,330,000 isn't my absolute dream, it's still a good profit, and it seems like we've reached an agreement that is acceptable to both of us.  It's better to close the deal now than to push for more and potentially lose the sale altogether."
