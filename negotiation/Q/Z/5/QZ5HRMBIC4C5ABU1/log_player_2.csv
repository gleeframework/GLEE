# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and there's a chance he can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you and your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

While $16,000 is better than $18,000, Bob should still reject the offer. He can likely negotiate a lower price or purchase the product from John for $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings to you and your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

While $15,500 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, which is within his budget."
