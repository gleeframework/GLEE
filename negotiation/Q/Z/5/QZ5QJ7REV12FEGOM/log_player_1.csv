"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's also a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum expectation.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my range. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment for me and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little higher in the next round.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to lower my price to $975,000. This is a good deal for both of us. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's within my acceptable range.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $900,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation and Bob seems stubborn.  I'm not convinced I can get a better price out of him, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,000,000."
