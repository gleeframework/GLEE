"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'm confident that my initial offer will pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a good profit. I believe this offer is fair and will encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's a fair deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
