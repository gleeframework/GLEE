Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to discussing that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your position, $20,000 is closer to the product's true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still above my limit.  I'm firm on $13,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is offering $13,000.  While I could try to push for more, it's getting closer to John's offer. Accepting Bob's offer now avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down and ensures a reasonable profit.
