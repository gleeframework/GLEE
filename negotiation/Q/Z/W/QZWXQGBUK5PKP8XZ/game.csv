"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the price point but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $11,200, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your previous offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I can do $11,000, which is the same price I offered initially, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the extras, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,750?  It's a good compromise and would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I think $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $11,250, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your latest one. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the product's value.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're close, but $11,250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $11,000, Bob. I think we've already established that you value the product at $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,000, so I'll offer it to you for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,9,
