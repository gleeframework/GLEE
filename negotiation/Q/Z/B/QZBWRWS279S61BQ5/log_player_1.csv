Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120.
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John if Bob refuses.

By starting at $150, we're aiming for a price significantly higher than our fallback option.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, while still ensuring a profit if he accepts the initial offer."
