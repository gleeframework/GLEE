"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your desired outcome.  This leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Not Too Aggressive:** While I value the product at $1,000,000 and Bob values it at $1,200,000, starting at $1,200,000 might be perceived as too aggressive and could lead to an immediate rejection.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the product's ""potential worth"" subtly implies its high value to Bob, encouraging him to seriously consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language ""initially proposing"" and ""mutually beneficial agreement"" signals to Bob that I'm open to negotiation and finding a deal that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is tempting as it's above my minimum, it's still considerably below his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Demonstrate Value:**  By not immediately accepting, I signal that the product is worth more to me than his initial offer.
* **Maintain Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting keeps the door open for a counteroffer that moves closer to a mutually beneficial price point.

I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation since I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting yours.  While I understand your position,  I believe the value this product brings warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $30,000, which is a significant enough concession to show Bob I'm flexible but not so large that I undervalue the product.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm reminding Bob of its worth and subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation towards a price closer to the middle of our current positions ($1,050,000 and $1,150,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,120,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,050,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,085,000?  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,085,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price is still $85,000 above my minimum acceptable price, representing a strong profit.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob's proposal to ""meet in the middle"" indicates a willingness to compromise and suggests he may be reaching his upper limit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation further for a potentially small gain might not be worth the risk of Bob walking away or significantly lowering his offer. 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain seems marginal compared to the risk of losing this deal altogether. Accepting now secures a good outcome."
