"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $8,500 is still too low for me, considering my minimum is $12,000.  I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,500?  It's a great product and I think it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000.  We're making progress, but $9,000 is still not high enough. I'm going to see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, but that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,100. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Even though I'm close to reaching a deal with Bob, it's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations. John's offer is my minimum, and I can get that price right away.  It's not worth risking that for a slightly higher price from Bob."
