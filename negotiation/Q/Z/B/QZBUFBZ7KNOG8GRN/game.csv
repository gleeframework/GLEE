"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While I acknowledge your final offer, I believe $850,000 doesn't fully reflect the value and potential this product holds for you.  To demonstrate my willingness to find common ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the significant benefit this product will provide. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm confident this price offers a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm still interested in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits of the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",875000.0,Bob,4,
