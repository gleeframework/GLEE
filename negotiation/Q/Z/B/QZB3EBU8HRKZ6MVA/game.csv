"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm definitely interested. However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $650,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $675,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",675000.0,Alice,3,
