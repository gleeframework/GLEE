"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm definitely interested. However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $650,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 675000}"
