"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You have 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm definitely interested. However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $650,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $675,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $675,000 is within your budget and represents a good compromise. You've already made a counteroffer and it seems Alice is willing to negotiate. Continuing to bargain might lead to a lower price, but it risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price while still leaving room for potential savings in future rounds."
