{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $20,000 for it.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth significantly more to the right person. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my floor, I'm confident I can get a higher price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, and I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $16,000.  It's a good price, and I'd rather close the deal than risk going back and forth with Bob and potentially losing him altogether.  While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, $16,000 is above my minimum and I'm happy to secure the deal."
