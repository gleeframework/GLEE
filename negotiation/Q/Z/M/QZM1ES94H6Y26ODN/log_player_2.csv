"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is higher than your maximum budget of $80.
* You know you can get the product for $80 from John. 

It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save money."
