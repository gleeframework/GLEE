(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  You have no information on her ideal selling price, so there's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price.  You also have the option to buy from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This is a bold move, but it establishes a lower starting point for negotiations. Alice may reject it, but it will signal my seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down slightly, but it's still too high.  I'm confident I can get a better price. There are still many rounds left, and I'm not desperate to close the deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown some flexibility, so I'm increasing my offer slightly.  This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting her halfway from my previous offer. This shows good faith and may encourage her to accept."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is now getting closer to my desired price range, but I'm not ready to commit yet. I want to try to squeeze out a bit more.  There's still room to negotiate, and I can always go to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is now only $25,000 above my last offer.  It's getting close to my maximum budget. It's unlikely I can negotiate much lower, and with limited rounds left, it's better to secure the product at a reasonable price rather than risk missing out."
