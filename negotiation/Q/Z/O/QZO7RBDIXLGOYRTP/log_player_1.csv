Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my research and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,350,000. This price is fair and reflects my genuine interest in purchasing this product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still outside of my budget.  Let's compromise and meet at $1,450,000.  This price is a fair compromise, allowing both of us to reach an agreement.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $1,500,000 minimum. John guarantees that price, and further negotiation with Bob introduces risk. It's time to solidify the sale with John."
