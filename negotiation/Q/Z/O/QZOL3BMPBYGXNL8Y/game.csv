Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?,130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $130. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, I'd like to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $132.50. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to my budget, so I'm going to need to go a little lower than that.  How about $131?  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",131.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer it to you for $133. What do you think?",133.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $133 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference again and go with $132. This feels like a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. ",132.0,Bob,8,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $131.50. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",131.5,Alice,9,
