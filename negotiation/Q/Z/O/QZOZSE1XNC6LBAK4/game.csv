"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000. I'm confident this product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. Let's split the difference and get this deal done.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
