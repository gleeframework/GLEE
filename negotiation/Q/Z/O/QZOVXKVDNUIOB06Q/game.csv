"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6000 is far too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, $10000 would be a more reasonable starting point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $8000 is still a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $9000? It's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $8500, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd consider?",8500.0,Bob,6,
