Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're entering a phase where the negotiations could drag on.  It's unlikely Bob will go much higher than $700,000. Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed win at this point, avoiding further risk and time spent negotiating."
