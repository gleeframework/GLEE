Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum. This allows for room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to a price I'm happy with.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price, which could lead to a more favorable outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've successfully sold the product.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and try to negotiate a price that works for both of us.
* **If Bob's counteroffer is too low:**  I'll make a counteroffer of my own or consider selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob is interested, his offer is too low. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. It's important to keep the negotiation open and respectful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $70 is a bit lower than what I can accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down a little, though.  Would you be willing to consider $120?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Rationale:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is significantly higher than his offer, but still lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Highlighting Benefits:** I'm framing my offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, which can make it more appealing to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've successfully sold the product at a price I'm comfortable with.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer! I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but not enough:**  $90 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price or a prolonged process.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing a sale without any further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:**  By selling to John, I ensure a quick and guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
