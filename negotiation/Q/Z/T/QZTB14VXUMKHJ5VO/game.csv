,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's worth a bit more than $120. How about we try $135? It's a fair price for a unique item like this.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. How about we try $110? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. How about we try $125? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for this unique product.",125.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in this product, but I'm not willing to pay $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $130, which would be $122.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",122.5,Bob,8,
