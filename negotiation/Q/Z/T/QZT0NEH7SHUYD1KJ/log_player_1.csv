Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and is attractive to Bob since it's less than his perceived value.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that he's getting a good deal. 

This approach aims to get the negotiation started on a positive note and sets a price point that's likely to be accepted.  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer with a price that's closer to my desired value.  This approach allows me to explore if there's a middle ground we can agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value Again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that my counteroffer is still a good deal.
* **Positive and Open Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still staying above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will accept this price, but if not, I'm ready to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a great deal for me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $12,500, I'm willing to accept his offer for several reasons:

* **Close to My Minimum:** The price is very close to my minimum, so I'm not losing out significantly.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  A successful sale with Bob could lead to future business opportunities. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and I might not get a better offer.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision in this scenario."
