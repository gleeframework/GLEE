# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's in my best interest to reject and make a counteroffer to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point. I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing some flexibility, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my goal of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm really eager to get this product, but I can only go up to $900,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $900,000, which would be $1,000,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I place on this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, $1,000,000 is still a significant amount over my budget. I'll continue negotiating with the goal of getting closer to my desired price point of $800,000. It's worth exploring if we can reach a mutually agreeable number before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to work within my budget, and $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $980,000 is still over my budget. With only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of successfully negotiating down to my desired price are slim. At this point, it's more financially beneficial to buy from John at $800,000, guaranteeing a purchase within my budget."
