Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point. I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
