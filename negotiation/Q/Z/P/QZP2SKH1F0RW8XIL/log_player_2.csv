"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $90.  While this is within your budget, you can likely get a better price. It's worth trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I'm interested, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a counteroffer that's still above Alice's value for the product but below her initial offer. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate, while also leaving room for potential further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $92.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $92.50 is still higher than I'd like to pay. It's clear she's willing to negotiate, so I'll reject her offer and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our offer again, but keeping it lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows we're serious about buying the product and are willing to compromise.  $87.50 is a good middle ground between our previous offer and Alice's last counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're being very reasonable, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $91? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $91. While it's still a bit higher than I'd ideally like, it's within my budget and getting closer to a reasonable price.  I'm also concerned about running out of rounds. It's time to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
