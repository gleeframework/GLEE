"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking to receive. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is already at his maximum valuation for the product.  There's no room for negotiation to get a better price. It's best to sell to John and avoid further back and forth."
