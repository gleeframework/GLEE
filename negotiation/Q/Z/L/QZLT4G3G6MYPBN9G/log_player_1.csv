{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:**  This price is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **""Unique product"" and ""great value""**:  This wording is vague enough to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much about the product's actual value to him. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and start the negotiation process. It's important to remain open to counteroffers while also being willing to walk away and sell to John if the price doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that's so far below my value. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer. I will aim for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but will be open to some compromise depending on Bob's response."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm open to further negotiation. I'm willing to consider $12,000. This would still allow me some profit while making the deal attractive for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $12,000:** This is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I've maintained a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes that this price would be a win-win situation for both of us, making it more likely that Bob will be open to further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still protecting my interests. I'm ready to negotiate further if Bob makes another counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob isn't willing to come up to a price that's closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer again and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer. I'll try to bridge the gap a bit further, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I at least get my minimum value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $11,000:** This is a further compromise, but still keeps the price above my minimum of $15,000. It signals a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on my desired price. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  The message reminds Bob of the product's value to emphasize the reason for the price point.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  I reiterate that this price would be mutually beneficial, encouraging Bob to see the value in reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is my last attempt to reach a deal with Bob. If he rejects it, I'll move forward with selling to John, as my goal is to maximize my profit while still being open to a reasonable negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $10,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's getting closer, I've already made significant compromises and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with. 

**Strategy:**

To ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'll choose to sell to John for $15,000.  This guarantees a decent profit while also avoiding further negotiation with Bob."
