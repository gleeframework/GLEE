"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a certain budget in mind, Bob. However, I want to emphasize that this product is truly unique and has a lot of value to offer. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $850000, but I think I can do better than that. Can you consider $875000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for in the market.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $920000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875000 and $920000, so I'll offer $897500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",897500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $897500. I've already met you at $920000 and you've countered down to $897500. I'm willing to meet you at $910000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that we might be at an impasse, and I'd like to consider other options.",910000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to an impasse, Alice, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $905000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that this is the best price we can agree on, but I'd like to give it one more shot.",905000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $905000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $912500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",912500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $907500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000.",907500.0,Bob,10,
