Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm looking to invest a bit less than $1200000. Would you consider a price of $1000000? I believe this is still a fair price that reflects the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
