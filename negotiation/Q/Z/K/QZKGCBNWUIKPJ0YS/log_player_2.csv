"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its rarity and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is exactly that, there's no immediate benefit to accepting. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm looking to invest a bit less than $1,200,000. Would you consider a price of $1,000,000? I believe this is still a fair price that reflects the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still within your budget and represents a significant discount from her initial price. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to compromise further or that the negotiations will drag on. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's favorable to you."
