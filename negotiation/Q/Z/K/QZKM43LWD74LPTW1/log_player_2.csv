"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity. The product we have to offer is not just any item; it holds immense value and potential for you, just like you see it worth $1,000,000. Our initial offer for this exceptional product is $950,000. We believe this price reflects its true worth while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let us know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you would like to discuss further terms. We look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is the best deal available. Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, getting it for $50,000 less is a significant savings.  While John's offer is a fallback option, it's not as financially advantageous as Alice's."
