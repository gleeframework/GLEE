I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid the product's value is higher than $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $11000. I'm willing to pay $9500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to buy from John.",10000.0,Bob,6,
