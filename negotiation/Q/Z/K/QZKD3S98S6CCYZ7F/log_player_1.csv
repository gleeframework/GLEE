"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer that's higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a price that's highly profitable. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, framing it around ""unique value and potential"" aims to spark his interest and potentially reframe his own valuation.  
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and open-ended (""What do you think?"") to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting now would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it's a starting point.  There are still 8 rounds left to negotiate a more favorable deal. 
* **John as a backup:** You have the security of selling to John for your minimum price. This gives you leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is considerably below its true value.  This product offers unique advantages that I'm confident can significantly benefit your business. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects its real worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This message reiterates the product's value and justifies the high price without completely dismissing Bob's offer.
* **Significant Step Down:** By decreasing the price by $150,000, you demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Focusing on Value:** By highlighting the product's potential benefits to Bob's business, you aim to shift his focus away from just the price and towards the long-term value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's potential benefits, but $1,350,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given our respective needs. This offer represents a significant increase from my previous proposal and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer has increased, $950,000 is still significantly less than your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Slow Progress:** Bob's counter-offers are increasing slowly. At this pace, it's unlikely you'll reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds.
* **Apply Pressure:** By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about the product's value and willing to walk away from the deal if necessary. This may incentivize Bob to make a more substantial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm open to finding a solution but need to see a more substantial move on your end. To be clear, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,250,000. This takes into account the value it offers and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a Clear Target:** By stating your desired price range directly ($1,250,000), you provide Bob with a clear understanding of your expectations. This helps avoid unnecessary back-and-forth with smaller increments.
* **Firm but Flexible:** While you're firm on the price range, you still leave some room for negotiation with the phrase ""closer to."" This might encourage Bob to offer something slightly above $1,250,000.
* **Limited Time Pressure:**  While you still have rounds left, stating that you need a ""more substantial move"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a more serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer is within my price range, and I believe it represents a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's not ideal, it represents a strong profit. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  It's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly better offer from Bob. He's made it clear that $1,250,000 is above his budget.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate returns.  Continuing to negotiate risks prolonging the process and potentially losing Bob altogether."
