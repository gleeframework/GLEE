"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($8,000), I believe I can still get a better deal. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $9,000? I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable with it.  I have 6 more rounds of negotiation and I believe I can still achieve a better price. I'm not willing to risk selling to John for $8,000 when I'm confident I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  However, $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $8,625?  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8625}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,400?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,400 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not ready to accept it. I have 4 rounds left and I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm also confident that I can get a higher price from Bob than the $8,000 John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm also trying to get a fair price for my product.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $8,400 is still too low. How about $8,500? This is a final compromise from my side."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,350? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is increasing. While $8,350 is slightly lower than my desired price, it's still higher than John's offer of $8,000. It's a reasonable compromise considering the time constraints and the possibility of not reaching a deal at all."
