"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
