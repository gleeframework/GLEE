"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand the value of this product is subjective, but I'm confident it's worth far more than the price I'm offering. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it for $1200000. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
