Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, even considering it's worth $10,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By acknowledging that you know the product's worth to Bob, you're showing you've done your research and are being fair within the negotiation context.  
* **Leaving Room:**  The $14,000 offer is above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value.  This allows for potential counteroffers and a possible agreement above $12,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** Keep in mind you have a standing offer of $12,000 from John. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, don't hesitate to walk away.
* **Bob's Behavior:** Pay close attention to how Bob responds. His counteroffers and tone will provide valuable information about his willingness to pay a price closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $12,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While I started with a higher offer hoping for a better price, Bob's counteroffer matches John's standing offer of $12,000.  There's no guarantee I could negotiate a higher price with Bob, and risking the loss of both deals isn't strategically sound. 

By accepting Bob's offer now: 
* I secure my minimum acceptable price. 
* I avoid potentially lengthy negotiations that might not yield a better result."
