**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. This means you're getting zero value from negotiating with her. 
* You have a guaranteed alternative with John for the same price.
* Rejecting Alice's offer means you can continue to try and get a better price from her or find another seller. You're not losing anything by rejecting."
