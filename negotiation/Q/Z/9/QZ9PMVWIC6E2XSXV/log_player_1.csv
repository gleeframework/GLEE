"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to maximize profit. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, creating a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,000.  I understand the product is valuable to you, but that's my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price still allows me to make a profit and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
