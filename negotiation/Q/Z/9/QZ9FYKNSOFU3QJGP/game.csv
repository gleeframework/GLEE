"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me and I believe it's a great value for you too. Considering its worth to both of us, how about we start at $95? I'm confident we can reach an agreement that suits both of our needs.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product. However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Let's try $85 as a starting point.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $87.  This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on it.",87.0,Bob,4,
