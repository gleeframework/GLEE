"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $95 to you. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's still higher than what the product is likely worth to you. By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose we settle at $90. This is a fair compromise between the original price and your counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your ideal price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and hopefully get a lower price.  Remember, you have 10 rounds to close the deal, so there's time to work towards a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a little too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and go with $87.50.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your suggestion. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. After careful consideration, I propose we set the price at $89. This acknowledges the value you see in the product while remaining within my desired range. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is a good compromise. While it's higher than your ideal price of $85, it's still a good deal considering you're willing to pay up to $100 for the product.  It's also likely that Alice will hold firm at $89, and further negotiation might not lead to a lower price.  Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product at a price you're comfortable with."
