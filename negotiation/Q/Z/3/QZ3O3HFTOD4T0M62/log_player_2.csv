"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  This is my final offer. Let me know your decision.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,500 is getting closer to his desired price, he can still potentially negotiate a better deal. It's worth seeing if Alice is truly committed to this price or willing to go a little lower."
