Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $15,000, you ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher value. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets a benchmark that makes your fallback price of $10,000 (to John) seem more appealing.
* **Politeness and Scarcity:** The message uses polite language and subtly implies scarcity (""before I make it available to others"") to make the offer seem more attractive.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  Remember, you have a strong alternative with John, so don't feel pressured to accept an offer below your minimum."
