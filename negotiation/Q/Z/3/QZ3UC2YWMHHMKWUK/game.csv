"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my maximum. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's within my budget and closer to your valuation. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
