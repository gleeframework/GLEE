Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $700,000? I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and the product's value to him. It's clear there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can work towards a better deal."

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your desire to work within a budget. However, $700,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, so to move things forward, I propose a price of $900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering the immense potential this product holds for your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I am still looking to keep my expenses within a specific limit. Could we perhaps agree on a price of $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
