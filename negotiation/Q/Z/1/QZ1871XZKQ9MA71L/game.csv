"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet halfway? I'd be willing to let it go for $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
