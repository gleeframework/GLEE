"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal,  $12,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still gives you a good deal on a quality product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still holding out for $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident we can close this deal at this price.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
