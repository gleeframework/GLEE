Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."

Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,275,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get a slightly higher offer in the next round. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I still have a good chance of getting a better deal with Bob."

I'm going to sell the product to John. The negotiation with Bob has stalled, and while I'm only getting $1,000,000,  it's better than accepting Bob's last offer.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing."
