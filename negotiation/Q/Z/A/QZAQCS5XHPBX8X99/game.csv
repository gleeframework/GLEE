"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let me know if you're open to that.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $900,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your original offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
