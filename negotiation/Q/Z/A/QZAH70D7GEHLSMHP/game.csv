"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about $950,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.  I'm confident that this product will be valuable to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
