Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before anyone else. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $95."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $100 as possible, but still make the offer attractive to Bob. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, so we shouldn't go below that.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so we need to offer a price that provides him with some value.
* **Psychology:** Offering a price slightly below $100 might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even if it's higher than his initial valuation. 

By offering the product at $95, we leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit margin than selling to John directly."
