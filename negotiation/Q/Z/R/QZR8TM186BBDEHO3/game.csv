"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $110. I'm looking to keep my spending within a budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
