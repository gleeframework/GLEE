"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $950,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value it brings while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
