"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $650,000. Can you consider this offer?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your desire to save, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $650,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,
