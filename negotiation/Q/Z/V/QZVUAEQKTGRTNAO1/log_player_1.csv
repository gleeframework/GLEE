Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your absolute minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By setting a high initial price, you ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher value. Even if Bob rejects the offer, his counteroffer might be higher than if you started lower.
* **Alternative in Mind:** You have John as a backup buyer, giving you leverage to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's offers remain too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.  Bob's willingness to counter at $1,200,000 suggests he might be willing to go higher, especially since he expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize the value you see at $1,200,000, I'm confident this product's true potential warrants a higher investment.  Could you consider $1,450,000?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's, aiming to keep the negotiation moving in a favorable direction. 
* **Justifying the Price:** By mentioning the ""true potential,"" we're subtly reminding Bob of the value the product holds."
