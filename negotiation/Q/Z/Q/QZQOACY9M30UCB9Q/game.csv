"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 is a bit low, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $17,000, which would be $14,500. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,4,
