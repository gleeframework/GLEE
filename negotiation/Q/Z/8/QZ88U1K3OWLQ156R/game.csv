"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $9,500 is simply too far below my asking price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,500. This is a fair price that takes into account your needs and my value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider it?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,900 just isn't going to cut it for me. If you're serious about buying this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final compromise. That's a significant discount from my initial price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
