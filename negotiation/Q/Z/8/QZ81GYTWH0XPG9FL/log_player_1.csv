"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below the midpoint of what it's worth to both of us, hoping to get a quick deal. But I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $80 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below the midpoint. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call.  Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 above my floor price of $80, so it's not a huge profit margin. However, we're getting close to the end of the rounds, and the risk of going lower and then having Bob reject my next offer means I could end up with $80 anyway by selling to John.  I'm going to take the $85 offer and close the deal."
