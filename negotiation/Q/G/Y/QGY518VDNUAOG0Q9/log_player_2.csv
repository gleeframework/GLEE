{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his ideal value as possible, but still leaving some room for negotiation. Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, demonstrating that Bob is serious about buying the product while also aiming for a significant discount."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal value, even though it's closer to his preferred price.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. He's still early in the negotiation process and there's potential to get a lower price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal value, even though it's closer to his preferred price. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. He's still early in the negotiation process and there's potential to get a lower price. Buying from John for $12,000 is still an option, but Bob wants to see if he can get a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting to close the gap with Alice's offer. He's increasing his offer again, demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product. However, he's still trying to get the price lower than Alice's last offer, showing that he's not ready to accept it just yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting closer to Bob's ideal value, but they are still above his limit.  At this point, the negotiation is becoming time-consuming, and there's a risk of not reaching a deal before the rounds run out.  Bob should avoid the risk and buy the product from John for $12,000, which is his absolute maximum.  While it's not his ideal price, it guarantees him the product and saves him the time and energy of further negotiation."
