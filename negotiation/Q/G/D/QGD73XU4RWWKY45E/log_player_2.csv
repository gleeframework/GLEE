# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as the product is worth more to her than to you.  Rejecting her initial offer allows you to try to get a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product.

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  $900,000 is closer to your limit, but there's still room for a compromise. You can try a counteroffer slightly higher than $850,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After reviewing your latest offer, we've decided to counter with a price of $890,000. This reflects a compromise that maintains a fair value for our product while acknowledging your financial constraints.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and the price is very close to your maximum budget. It's likely that further negotiation will result in a price that's still too high for you. Accepting the offer is the best option to secure the product at a price that's only slightly more than your target."
