"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",11500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,800 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $11,100?  This would allow us to close the deal and ensure both of us are happy with the outcome.  What do you say?",11100.0,Alice,7,
