Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $1,800,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

I'm confident that Bob will want to make a counteroffer, as he values the product at $1,500,000. We can then use that information to further adjust my offer and hopefully land a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's not worth it to sell to him at that price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.  This price is also closer to Bob's offer, which hopefully will lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd love to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing.  It's time to close the deal."
