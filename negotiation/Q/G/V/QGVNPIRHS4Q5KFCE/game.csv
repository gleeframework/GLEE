"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This would still be a profitable transaction for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise.  This offer gives you a significant profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,220,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
