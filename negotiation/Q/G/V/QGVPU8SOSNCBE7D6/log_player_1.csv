Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $170, I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price. There's no room for negotiation to earn more, and John is offering the same amount. It makes sense to sell to John and avoid further back and forth."
