Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  It's important to start high to maximize profit, but also to be reasonable so Bob doesn't immediately reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy with the $120, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway by offering $135. This is a fair compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

``` 

While Bob's offer is only $5 more than what John would pay, it's still a better deal than selling to John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure a slightly higher price."
