"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",10000.0,Alice,5,
