"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I believe this price represents a fair deal given its potential value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice is starting high:**  Alice's opening offer of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation. She clearly wants to maximize her profit. 
* **You have a backup plan:** You know John will sell you the product for $1,200,000. This gives you leverage.

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. She'll likely come back with a lower price in an attempt to avoid losing the sale entirely."
