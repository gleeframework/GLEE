"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know your thoughts.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to go up to $8,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $8,000. However, I've already received an offer from another buyer, John, who is willing to buy the product at the minimum price of $8,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,200, but I need to consider John's offer. If you're willing to meet me at $8,200, I'll give you the product. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",8200.0,Alice,5,
