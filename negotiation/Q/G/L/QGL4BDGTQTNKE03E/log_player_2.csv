"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $20,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget and maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate down or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"",

``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly. It acknowledges Alice's offer but sets a firm position much closer to your ideal price. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents its true value, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but $16,000 is still more than you need to pay. You're closer to John's price, so another counteroffer might bring Alice closer to an acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $16,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle of our last two offers at $14,000?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer proposes a compromise by averaging your previous offer ($12,000) and Alice's current offer ($16,000). 
* **Staying competitive:** While $14,000 is still above John's price, it shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but remain firm about your budget.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer leaves some space for Alice to potentially counter with a price slightly above John's offer if she's really motivated to sell to you."
