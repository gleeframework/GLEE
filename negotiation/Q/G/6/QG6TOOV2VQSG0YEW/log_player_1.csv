"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows I'm open to a deal.  I'll evaluate Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for more.  I believe there's room to negotiate further, and I want to see if Bob is willing to come up. I'm also considering the potential of selling to John, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $9,500? This would be a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm feeling the pressure to close the deal, $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.  If that fails, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 as a final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit concerned about the price, and I'm not willing to go up to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John.  I've made several counteroffers, and Bob's offers are still too low. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's significantly below my minimum.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, and I'm going to take it."
