,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $15500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $15500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make at least $16500 to make it worth my while. Can you think about meeting me at $16500?",16500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but $16500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $16250. Would you be willing to consider that price?",16250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $16250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make at least $17000 to meet my minimum. Can you think about meeting me at $17000?",17000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but $17000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $16000, and I hope you can meet me at that price. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the end of the road. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make at least $16500 to meet my minimum. However, I'm also aware that you've made a final offer, and I respect that. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16500.0,Alice,9,
