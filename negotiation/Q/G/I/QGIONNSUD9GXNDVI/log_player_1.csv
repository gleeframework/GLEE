Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows you to potentially gain more profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial offer, it leaves space for him to counter-offer and potentially meet at a price higher than your minimum.
* **Consider the Alternative:** You know John will buy the product for $120, which acts as your safety net. This knowledge allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
