"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $140. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit too low for me, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $135. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $135 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $130, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll have to consider other options.",130.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $130 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $138. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal. What do you think?",138.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've already offered $130, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'd like to remind you that I can buy the product from John for $120, which is a much better deal for me.",130.0,Bob,8,
