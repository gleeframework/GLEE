"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to pay up to $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair value for the item while making it more accessible to you. Please let me know if this offer suits your needs.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $80. If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to go with another seller.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. In light of your firm offer of $80, I am willing to consider this price. However, I must also ensure that we reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Therefore, I am proposing a final offer of $95 for the product. This price still reflects its value while allowing us to close the deal. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",95.0,Alice,5,
