Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $14,500. I think it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Create Urgency:** Highlighting a ""special price"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Why not higher?**  While Alice could start higher, it risks Bob immediately rejecting the offer without trying to negotiate. 

**Why not lower?** Going much lower than $14,500 would significantly reduce Alice's potential profit, especially since she has a guaranteed buyer at $15,000."
