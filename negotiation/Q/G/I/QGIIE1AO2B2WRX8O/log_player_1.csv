Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,500,000, getting Bob to bite at a slightly lower price means a quicker, less complicated sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a substantial profit margin. It's high enough to be appealing to Alice (selling significantly above her minimum), but also offers Bob a $400,000 potential gain.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message hints at other buyers (""limited-time,"" ""other interested parties"") to encourage Bob to act quickly."
