"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the middle ground you suggested, but unfortunately, I still can't reach $13,000. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
