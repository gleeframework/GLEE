Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to allow room for negotiation. This leaves Bob with the impression that there's room for compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly less than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) but also gives you a good margin above your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  This initial offer allows you to potentially decrease your asking price during the negotiation process while still securing a favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers up to $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation. Accepting his first counteroffer might signal that you're willing to settle quickly, potentially leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, and I appreciate your offer.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,275,000. I believe this reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your constraints."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway between your previous offer ($1,350,000) and his counteroffer ($1,200,000). 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** By countering at $1,275,000, you're still significantly above your minimum acceptable price while showing flexibility.
* **Encouraging a Response:** This approach keeps the negotiation active and encourages Bob to either accept, make a counteroffer closer to your target, or reveal more about his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet at $1,275,000 due to my financial constraints. I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of both the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now countered twice at $1,200,000, indicating this is likely his firm upper limit.  While we'd prefer a higher price, consider:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,200,000 is still a $200,000 profit above our minimum.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging negotiations delays getting this capital, which could be reinvested.
* **Risk of Losing Both:** Holding out for more risks Bob walking away entirely, leaving us to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

It's a good deal, even if not the absolute ideal."
