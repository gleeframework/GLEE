""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to make a deal at $14,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower allows room to potentially make more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,500 is a significant discount from the original price, making it more enticing for Bob. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing subtly implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

This strategy balances securing a good deal with the knowledge that we have a backup buyer."
