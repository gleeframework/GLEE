"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" and ""significant return on investment,"" we're emphasizing the product's worth, potentially justifying the high initial price in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The significant gap between Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and the asking price ($2,000,000) leaves ample room for negotiation. 

This strategy allows us to:

1. **Understand Bob's Position:** His response will indicate how eager he is to buy and how much he might be willing to pay.
2. **Maintain Control:** We set the initial negotiation anchor, potentially influencing his counteroffer. 

Remember, we have John as a backup offer, so we're not desperate to close a deal at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), we still have room to negotiate.  Here's why:

* **Negotiation Dynamics:** Accepting an offer too quickly can signal that we were willing to go even lower. By rejecting, we demonstrate that we value the product and are looking for a price that reflects its worth.
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup willing to pay our minimum acceptable price gives us leverage in this negotiation.  

We'll use the next round to counter Bob's offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair, the unique benefits this product offers do command a premium price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This recognizes the value you're getting while acknowledging the significant potential this unlocks for your business."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down from $2,000,000 to $1,700,000, showing Bob a willingness to negotiate. However, the concession isn't too drastic.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This classic negotiation tactic often feels psychologically fair to both parties, even if the midpoint isn't mathematically precise. 
* **Reiterating Value:** We're continuing to emphasize the unique benefits and potential of the product to justify the higher price in Bob's mind.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Keep the Negotiation Moving:**  We want to avoid a stalemate.
* **Gauge Bob's Flexibility:**  His response will reveal how much he's willing to move from his $1,400,000 offer. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** We're still aiming for a price that exceeds our minimum acceptable offer, maximizing our potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to consider $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me, so I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000 is the maximum I can go, but I can do $1,300,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Furthermore, his language suggests he's unlikely to move much higher. 

* **""A bit too high"":** This implies that even $1,500,000 might be a stretch for him.
* **""Maximum I can go"":** This is a common negotiation tactic, but it signals that he's reaching his limit. 

Given these factors, it's unlikely we'll be able to negotiate a price with Bob that meets our needs.  It's in our best interest to accept John's offer of $1,500,000, ensuring we receive our minimum acceptable price without further risk or delay."
