"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $9,200 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000 to $9,500. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can meet you at $9,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $9,100 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you at $8,900.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",8900.0,Bob,6,
