"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This still leaves room for profit for you, and is closer to a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $775,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
