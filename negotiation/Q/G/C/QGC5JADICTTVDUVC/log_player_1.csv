"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I have 8 rounds left and the potential to negotiate a better price with Bob, or I can sell to John for a guaranteed $800,000. It's too early to give in to such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This still leaves room for profit for you, and is closer to a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired range. I have 6 rounds left to continue negotiating and see if I can secure a price closer to $850,000. Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $775,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 finally meets my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially try to negotiate a higher price, there's a risk he might walk away.  With only 4 rounds left, accepting his offer is the safest and most financially sound option.  I'm also confident I can still achieve a better outcome than selling to John for the same price."
