Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This still leaves room for profit for you, and is closer to a fair price for both of us. What do you think?
