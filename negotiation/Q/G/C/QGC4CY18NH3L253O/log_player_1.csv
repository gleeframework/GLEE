Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range benefits both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. A price too close to $1,200,000 might make him balk, while a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves potential profit on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  Start by highlighting the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Strong Price:** $1,150,000 is a strong opening offer. It leaves you room for potential negotiation (if Bob counters) while still securing a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **No Justification:** Avoid providing reasons for the price unless Bob asks. Let him respond first.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price within the ZOPA based on your risk tolerance and how aggressively you want to negotiate."
