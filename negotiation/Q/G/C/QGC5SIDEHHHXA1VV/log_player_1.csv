Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $107 isn't quite working for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $109?  I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 109}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $108 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $108 is closer to my target price, I'm running out of rounds. It's not worth the risk of continuing with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price.  It's better to sell to John for $120 and ensure I get my desired profit."
