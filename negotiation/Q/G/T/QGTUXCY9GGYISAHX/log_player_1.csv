Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250?"", ""product_price"": 12250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems pretty set at a price point significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and I'd rather take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
