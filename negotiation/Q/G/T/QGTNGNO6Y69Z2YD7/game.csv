"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to your desired price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $6,750 is still below my minimum. Let's try $7,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",7000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $6,875?",6875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  While I appreciate your offer, $6,875 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",7000.0,Alice,7,
