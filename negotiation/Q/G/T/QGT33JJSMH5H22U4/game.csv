"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant compromise on my end.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
