"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you value it at $15,000 and it's worth at least $8,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really want to get the best deal possible. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $10,500?  This is still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think we can do better. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
