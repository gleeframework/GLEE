Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:** We aim to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for you. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, since you have a guaranteed sale with John at $120, you're not risking a loss."
