Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1300000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm prepared to offer $1100000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
