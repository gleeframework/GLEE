Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $12,000 (You'll sell to John for this)
* **Bob's Value:** $10,000 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $10,000 and $12,000. Any price within this range can potentially lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price closer to $12,000 without alienating Bob completely. Here's a balanced approach:

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and the current market, I believe a price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting high anchors the negotiation in your favor.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value"" and ""current market"" adds perceived value.
* **Leaving Room:** The $500 gap allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Polite but Firm:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages a response while maintaining a position of strength.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might consider a slightly lower starting point.
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might be willing to accept a smaller profit margin.
