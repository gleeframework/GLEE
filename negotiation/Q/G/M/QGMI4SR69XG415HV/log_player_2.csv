"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to Bob, and Alice's offer is far too high.  Rejecting the offer and proceeding to a counteroffer makes sense in this situation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, and is well within Bob's budget. It's a starting point for negotiation and signals that Bob is serious about buying the product, but at a price that reflects its value to him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While $160 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still too high. There's room for more negotiation, and Bob shouldn't rush into an agreement that doesn't significantly benefit him.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives Bob more control over the final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise, but he's still significantly below Alice's last offer. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining Bob's goal of getting the product at a price that's reasonable for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal if he continues to counteroffer. He should aim for a price closer to his maximum value of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price point.  A counteroffer of $90 demonstrates a willingness to compromise but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a strong move that shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but isn't willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is tempting and getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still a bit too high. There's no urgency to accept this offer. Rejecting and counteroffering keeps the negotiation moving and gives Bob the opportunity to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

Bob is getting increasingly close to his maximum value, but is still trying to get the best possible deal. This counteroffer shows a serious intention to buy, but also keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further. It's a good move to keep the negotiation moving towards a positive outcome for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is tempting and getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still a bit too high. There's no urgency to accept this offer.  Bob has only one round left and can get the product from John for $100, so he should try to squeeze out the last bit of negotiation. Rejecting and counteroffering keeps the negotiation moving and gives Bob the opportunity to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

This is Bob's final offer, and it reflects his maximum value for the product.  He is essentially saying, ""This is my final price.  If you don't accept, I'll go with John."" This puts the pressure on Alice to make a decision. If she rejects, Bob knows his fallback option is to buy from John, which is a good position to be in."
