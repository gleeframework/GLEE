# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,200,000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly more than your $800,000 maximum and what John is offering. You can do better by rejecting this offer."
