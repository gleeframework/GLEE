"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,350,000 is a bit steep for the product. I would like to propose $1,300,000 again, as I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
