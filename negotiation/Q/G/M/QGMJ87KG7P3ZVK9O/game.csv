"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, and I think this price is more reasonable for me.",16500.0,Bob,4,
