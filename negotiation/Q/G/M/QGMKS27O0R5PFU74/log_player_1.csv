"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,200,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  We're aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaving room for negotiation. Starting at $2,200,000 gives us space to come down while still aiming for a final price well above our minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** We haven't mentioned our walk-away point (selling to John) yet. It's best kept as leverage for later rounds if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer, but it's significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in a fair deal - how about we bring the price down to something more realistic? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). While he's showing willingness to negotiate, accepting now would mean a substantial loss. We have room to negotiate and will aim to bring him closer to our range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  However, your offer is quite a bit below what I believe is a fair reflection of this product's value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** We start by recognizing Bob's participation, fostering a positive negotiation environment.
* **Firm but Flexible:** While stating his offer is too low, we demonstrate flexibility by making a significant reduction from our initial price. This signals willingness to negotiate while emphasizing we're seeking a substantial sum.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The price drop is substantial but still keeps us well above both Bob's offer and our walk-away point ($1,500,000). This aims to create movement from Bob while preserving our position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but we're still a long way apart. To be frank, if we can't find a price closer to my budget, I'll have to consider John's offer.  I'm proposing $1,100,000 -  it's a significant jump from my last offer, showing I'm serious about getting this done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Getting Anxious:** Bob mentioning John's offer indicates he's feeling pressure and might be willing to go higher. We still have the upper hand knowing our alternative option.
* **Offer Still Too Low:**  While $1,100,000 is a more substantial jump, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're only in Round 4, leaving us with time to negotiate further and potentially bring Bob closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, and I'm glad you're serious about this deal. It's a unique product, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you.  Let's bridge the gap - I propose $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Empathy and Reassurance:** We acknowledge Bob's perspective and reiterate the product's value to keep him engaged.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  Our price drop is smaller this time ($200,000), signaling that we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The offer of $1,700,000 keeps us above Bob's last offer while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed. We're aiming to secure a price that is beneficial for both sides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the price is still significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't agree on this, I'm afraid I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Tactic:** Bob is clearly trying to pressure us by mentioning John's offer and stating his ""absolute limit."" However, we know he has a strong incentive to buy below $1,500,000.
* **Still Below Our Minimum:** $1,250,000 is closer, but still under our absolute minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Time for a Calculated Risk:** We're past the halfway point, but we have some leverage and time to take a calculated risk. We'll hold firm in the next round and see if we can push Bob closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you. However, this product's unique value justifies the price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,600,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is as low as I'm willing to go."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and Compromise:** We introduce this offer as ""final,"" creating a sense of urgency. We also emphasize our compromise while staying firm above our $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential gains he'd be missing by going with John.
* **Calculated Risk:**  This is a strong stance. We risk losing Bob, but it's a calculated one. We're betting that his need for the product, combined with the price being below his perceived value, will push him to accept or make a serious counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I respect your position, but I can't justify going that high.  My absolute maximum is $1,300,000. I understand this is a firm offer, and I'm taking a risk here. However, I believe this is a fair deal considering John's offer is still available.  It's your call. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We only have two rounds left, and Bob is unlikely to go much higher. 
* **Strong Offer, Considering:** While not ideal, $1,300,000 is a significant profit over Bob's initial offers and a decent margin above our walk-away point. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push Bob risks losing him to John's offer. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
