"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $200 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much bargaining power I have. This offer is within my budget and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you do $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but it's still way above my budget and what I'm willing to pay.  I'll counteroffer again, moving closer to a more reasonable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's valuable, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about $95?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

Explanation:

* I'm increasing my offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* $95 is still within my budget, and it puts some pressure on Alice since it's getting closer to my walk-away point ($100). 
* By now, Alice should understand I'm serious about buying but need a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $150 for this.  It's a fantastic deal at that price. How about we split the difference and call it $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $125 is still more than I want to spend, especially knowing I have the fallback option of John. I'll hold firm for now and see if she's willing to move closer to my price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's the highest I can go."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:** I acknowledge Alice's efforts to compromise but stand firm on my budget limitations.
* **""Meet in the middle"":**  This phrasing suggests a final offer and creates a sense of urgency.
* **$110:**  This is my final compromise, slightly above my walk-away price but a significant saving compared to Alice's earlier offers. 

Now it's up to Alice. This offer demonstrates serious intent while leaving me the option to go with John if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting a steal at this price.  $110 is really my bottom line.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my price. This is a good deal compared to her initial offer, and I'm saving money compared to John's price.  There's no point in pushing further and risking losing the deal."
