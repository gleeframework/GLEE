"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider a price of $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
