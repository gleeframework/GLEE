Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is your limit, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met her absolute bottom price. She's indicated this is as low as she'll go.  Continuing to negotiate risks her walking away or you having to settle for a price closer to John's offer.  Accepting now secures the product at the best possible price from Alice."
