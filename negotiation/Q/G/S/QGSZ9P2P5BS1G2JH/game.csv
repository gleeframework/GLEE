"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that goes beyond its immediate price tag.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $1,475,000?",1475000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,475,000 is close, but I need to be firm.  Would you consider $1,490,000?  This is my final offer.",1490000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,490,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,475,000, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'd love to hear you out and see if we can come to an agreement.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
