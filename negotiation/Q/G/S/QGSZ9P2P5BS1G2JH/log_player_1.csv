Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that goes beyond its immediate price tag.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $1,475,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, I'm still above my minimum sale price to John. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if I can get closer to $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,475,000 is close, but I need to be firm.  Would you consider $1,490,000?  This is my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,490,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,475,000, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'd love to hear you out and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,475,000 and has indicated this is his best offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,500,000,  accepting his offer is still significantly more profitable than selling to John for $1,200,000. It's time to close the deal."
