"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but that price is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit below my minimum threshold. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Considering our previous discussions, I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
