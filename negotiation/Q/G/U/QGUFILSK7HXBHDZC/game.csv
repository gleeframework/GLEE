"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm open to finding common ground. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000?  This price still gives you a significant advantage over buying from John, and it's closer to my ideal price point.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $940,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",940000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $940,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. Let's split the difference again and settle at $970,000. This would mean a significant gain for you compared to buying from John, and it's a fair compromise for me.  What do you think?",970000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. Let's make this our final exchange - how about $955,000? That's my best and final offer.",955000.0,Bob,6,
