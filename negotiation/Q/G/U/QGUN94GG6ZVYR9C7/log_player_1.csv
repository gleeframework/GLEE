Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is above your $8,000 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's space for him to counter-offer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's aggressive:** It shows you're confident in your product and willing to negotiate from a strong position. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below your desired profit margin. It's worth taking another round of negotiation to see if you can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's lower than your initial offer:**  This shows you're willing to be flexible. 
* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** You're still aiming for a better price than his offer.
* **It's within a reasonable range:** It's closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,700 is close enough to my minimum of $8,000 that it's worth accepting. While it's not my ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $8,000 and it avoids further negotiation."
