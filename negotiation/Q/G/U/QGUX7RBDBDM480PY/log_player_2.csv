Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your input. In light of our discussion, I would like to propose a revised price of $900,000 for the product. This still represents a significant profit for me while offering you a competitive price. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a slight decrease from the initial offer, you can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  You're aiming for a price closer to $850,000, so rejecting this offer keeps you on track to reach your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement this time."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I value your patience during these negotiations. Considering our past discussions, I am now willing to offer the product at $875,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive. I hope this proposal is more acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to your desired price point of $850,000. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance that you won't get a significantly better price. Accepting this offer saves you time and potentially avoids the risk of Alice becoming more resistant to negotiation. It's a good compromise, as you're still getting a substantial discount from the initial offer and from John's price."
