"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the details you've provided about the product's value. However,  $1500000 is at the very top of my budget. To make this work for me, I'd need to come in at a lower price point.  I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product.  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and explore the benefits you've described. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
