Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $145. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying above your minimum. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum price."
