"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  It's a great product, but I'm really hoping to stay within a budget of $800000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850000 is closer, I'm still hoping to stay within my budget of $800000. Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $825000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $20000, so the effective price would be $830000. What do you think?",830000.0,Alice,5,
