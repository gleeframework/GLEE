"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,
