"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we compromise at $1,050,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $975,000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",975000.0,Alice,5,
