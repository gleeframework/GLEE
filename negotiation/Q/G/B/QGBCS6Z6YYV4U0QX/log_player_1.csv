Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to see if you can get a better deal.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering the product at $15,000 gives you room to negotiate.  It's a common tactic to start higher than your desired price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers, you create a sense of scarcity and encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to settle on a price that's still above your minimum."
