"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider a price of $950,000.  This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to come up to $1,000,000, which is a significant amount for me.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,020,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
