"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay. I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere closer to my original price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the research I've done on the market. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. While I believe this product is valuable, I can't justify going beyond $900,000. This price reflects the potential benefit to me and provides you with a reasonable return.  Let's work together to find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for this product. It's a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to you.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
