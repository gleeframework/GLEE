Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay. I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere closer to my original price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the research I've done on the market. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. While I believe this product is valuable, I can't justify going beyond $900,000. This price reflects the potential benefit to me and provides you with a reasonable return.  Let's work together to find common ground.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
