"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $7,500. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's lower than the product's value to her, but it's still above your maximum budget. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to drive the price down further.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  It's good to have, but it's not the best deal if you can get it cheaper from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $7,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the value the product brings to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,200. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your desired price.**  The $7,200 offer is within your budget and significantly lower than her initial offer.
* **There's risk in further negotiation.** While you could potentially push for a lower price, you only have 7 rounds left. 
* **John's price is a good backup.**  But you've already gotten a better deal from Alice.

It's a good balance of risk and reward to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
