"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,050,000. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell the product for $1,075,000. This would still give you a healthy profit, and it's a fair price for the value I'm offering. Let me know if you're open to that.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
