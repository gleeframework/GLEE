Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the direction we're heading, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $77. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $81? It's a small step up from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $80. While we have room to negotiate, the gains are getting smaller and we risk her digging in. Accepting at $81 secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
