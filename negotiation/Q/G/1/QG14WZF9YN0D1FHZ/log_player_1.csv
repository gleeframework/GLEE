"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start high in a negotiation. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential"" of the product, we're subtly justifying the high asking price.
* **Openness:**  Even though we start high, we signal flexibility and willingness to listen to Bob's perspective. This can prevent immediate rejection and encourage a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, it's too early to settle. We started high, and Bob went straight to his perceived fair value without much negotiation. This suggests there might be room for us to negotiate a higher price. We'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I recognize your perspective on the value, I believe the product holds even greater potential than that figure reflects. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** We start by acknowledging Bob's offer, demonstrating respect for his position in the negotiation.
* **Reiterating Value:** We subtly reassert our belief in the product's high value without directly dismissing Bob's perception.
* **Compromise:** We propose meeting ""halfway"" at $1,500,000.  This is a strong anchor point that's significantly above Bob's initial offer but still allows room for further negotiation. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** We end with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to respond and continue the dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is now negotiating and moving closer to our desired price point.  
* **Concession Pattern:**  By suggesting ""halfway,"" Bob is establishing a pattern of concessions. We can leverage this in the next round.
* **Potential Upside:** We still have plenty of rounds left, and rejecting this offer might lead to an even better offer from Bob.

We'll continue negotiating, aiming to push Bob closer to $1,400,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we're both in agreement that this product has significant value. How about we settle at $1,400,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true worth of what we're discussing."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** We start by highlighting the common ground and Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Final Offer Framing:** We're presenting this counter-offer as a ""fair compromise"" and using language that suggests it's our final position. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We're conceding to $1,400,000, which is a strong point psychologically (just above the midpoint between his last offer and our previous ask).
* **Call to Action:** While not explicit, the tone suggests we're aiming to close the deal on this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,400,000. I'd like to propose $1,250,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** We've successfully negotiated Bob up from $1,200,000 to $1,250,000, securing a $50,000 gain from our minimum.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is signaling that $1,250,000 is his absolute limit. Pushing further risks souring the deal and potentially losing the sale. 
* **Time Value:** We still have rounds left, but there's no guarantee of getting a better offer from Bob. Accepting now avoids the risk of a stalemate.

While we could push for slightly more, accepting $1,250,000 represents a solid outcome in a successful negotiation."
