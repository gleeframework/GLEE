Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and leaves some room for concessions.
* **Positive message:**  I'm using a friendly and positive message to encourage Bob to engage with the offer.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm not just stating the price, but hinting at the product's value to Bob, hoping to make the offer more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120).** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me to make a profit considering the product's value to me. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  John is guaranteed to buy the product at $120, which is significantly better than Bob's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great deal for a product of this quality, and it's still within a reasonable range. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $105 is a compromise between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90.  This shows that I am willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reinforcing the value of the product by emphasizing its quality. This helps to justify the price.
* **Reasonable range:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal within a reasonable price range. This can make the price more palatable to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price of $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.** While it's closer, it's not enough to make a profit considering the product's value to me.
* **John offers a much better price.** Selling to John for $120 ensures that I meet my minimum profit requirement and maximizes my earnings.

**Next Steps:**

* I will sell the product to John, as it's the most profitable option at this point."
