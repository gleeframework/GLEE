Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to gain from his higher valuation.

**The Offer**

The key is to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Here's a strong approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High but Fair:** $1,150,000 is a significant markup from your minimum but still leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain compared to his valuation.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition,"" you subtly remind Bob of its worth.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"":** Creates a sense of scarcity and importance, potentially making the offer more enticing.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style (aggressive, passive, etc.), you might adjust your approach.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill.
