Alice is definitely getting closer, but I still think there's some wiggle room. I'll counter slightly below her offer to see if she's willing to budge a bit more."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has started to come back up in price. This suggests we're reaching her lower limit. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and this price is good enough that it's not worth risking the deal for a few more dollars."
