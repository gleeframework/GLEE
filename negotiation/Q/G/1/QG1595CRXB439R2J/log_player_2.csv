"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $7,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value of the product, $7,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $6,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,800. This is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $6,800 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get it a little lower. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  I'm still feeling a bit high at $6,800. Would you be willing to come down to $6,600?  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $6,700. This is a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, $6,700 is a good deal, saving me $1,300 compared to buying from John. While I could try for a lower price, there's a risk Alice will reject my offer, and I might end up paying more in the end. It's time to close the deal."
