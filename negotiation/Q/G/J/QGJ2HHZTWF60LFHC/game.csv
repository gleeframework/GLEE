"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I could do $10,000, but that's really the limit for me.",10000.0,Bob,6,
