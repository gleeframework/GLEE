{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a friendly and positive tone for the interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand you're working within a budget, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
