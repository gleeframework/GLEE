"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand you're working within a budget, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8000.0,Alice,3,
