"Alice,  $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $95 for the product.  Let's try to find a compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $105. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product's quality. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go to $100 for this product.  That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already told you, Bob, that $100 is my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to hold out for a better offer, but I'm not going to sell it to you for less than $100. You can either accept my minimum price or walk away.",100.0,Alice,7,
