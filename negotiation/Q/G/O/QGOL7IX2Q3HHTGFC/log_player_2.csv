It's always advantageous to try and negotiate a better price. Since you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to explore lower prices."

{""product_price"": 900000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my limit, I'm still able to potentially negotiate a better price. There's a chance I can push her down to closer to $1,000,000, making it worthwhile to continue negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal. It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially be accepted."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $50,000 lower than John's price.  The chance of getting Alice down to my target price of $1,000,000 seems low. It's more efficient and less risky to buy from John at this point."
