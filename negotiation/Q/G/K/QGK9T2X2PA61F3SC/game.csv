"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This gives you a good deal, and ensures I can move forward with the sale.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $925,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $887,500?",887500.0,Bob,4,
