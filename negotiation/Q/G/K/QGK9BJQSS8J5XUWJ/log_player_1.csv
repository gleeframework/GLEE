Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is higher than Bob's valuation ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to get Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $12,000 is a good starting point, potentially leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Avoid immediate rejection:** The price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, reducing the risk of an immediate rejection. 
* **Set the tone for negotiation:** A friendly and encouraging message sets a positive tone for potential back-and-forth negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would you consider selling it to me for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. 
* **Proceed to the Next Round:**  While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it's still within his valuation.  This indicates he is genuinely interested in the product, and further negotiation might be possible. 

This decision balances the need for a good profit with the possibility of a more favorable outcome through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While I'm not able to go down to $10,000, I'm open to a slightly lower price. How about $11,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would be closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500:** This price is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000).  It's still a good profit for me, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value for Bob while acknowledging his initial offer.  It also reiterates the importance of the deal being mutually beneficial.

This approach aims to:

* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm signaling that I'm still interested in selling to Bob. 
* **Find a middle ground:** $11,500 represents a potentially acceptable compromise for both parties. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message is friendly and open, hoping to continue the negotiations constructively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose $11,000 as a potential compromise. This would allow us to reach an agreement that respects both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accept Bob's Offer:** While $11,000 is still lower than my desired price, it's only $500 less than my previous counteroffer. Accepting this offer would:
    * Guarantee a sale and avoid further negotiation.
    * Bring in a significant profit of $11,000, which is much better than selling to John for $15,000. 

This decision balances the desire for a higher price with the risks and uncertainties associated with further negotiation.  It's a pragmatic choice that secures a good profit and avoids potential delays or complications."
