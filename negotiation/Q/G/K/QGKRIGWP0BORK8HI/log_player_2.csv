"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product that's worth so much to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about getting a lower price and willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but there's still a potential $500 difference.  It's worth one more counter-offer to see if we can get closer to the $10,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,750.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but how about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower. The difference now is only $125, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the $10,000 price point, which was the initial goal."
