Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product that's worth so much to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you some wiggle room to accept a counteroffer if it's close enough to your target.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It doesn't leave any ambiguity for Bob about the price. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between getting the best price and not scaring Bob away with a too-high initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sacrifice so much. I will counteroffer him to see if we can reach a compromise."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'll try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
