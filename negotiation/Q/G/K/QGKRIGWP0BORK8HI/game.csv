"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but how about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,5,
