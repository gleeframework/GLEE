Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still offers you a good profit margin.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer because it is below my minimum acceptable price. I want to try to negotiate a higher price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still too far away from my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get him closer to my goal before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not comfortable going above $1,225,000. Can we meet at $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob is not budging much. I've already had to drop my price significantly, and it doesn't look like I'll be able to get much closer to my desired amount. It's better to sell to John and guarantee my desired profit than to risk a deal falling through with Bob."
