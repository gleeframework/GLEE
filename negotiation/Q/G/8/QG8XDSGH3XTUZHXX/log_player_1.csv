"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'll get.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with a price of $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), it's still below it.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the back and forth.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John now would guarantee me my minimum price, but I'm optimistic about potentially earning more by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  How about $13,500? This is a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's work together to find a solution!"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise and highlighting the value Bob will still get, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to incentivize him to agree to a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We've reached a point where Bob's counteroffer is the same as my previous offer. Continuing to negotiate may result in a longer process without a significant price increase.
* **Time Constraint:** With limited rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While selling to John would guarantee my minimum acceptable price, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale with a decent profit, minimizing the risk of not closing the deal."
