Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $125. I think it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation if Bob attempts to haggle.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering the product at $125 still nets you a $25 profit if Bob accepts.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer positions the price as potentially negotiable while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. This might make him consider it more seriously than a lower offer. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer outright. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, there's no risk of losing money by aiming higher with Bob initially."
