{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  You want to save as much money as possible.  $8,000 is a good price, but you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $1,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within a reasonable range.  It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved up slightly from her initial offer, but it's still not as good as my counteroffer. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I still have time and can potentially get a better price.  I don't want to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm going to compromise a bit by moving up from my previous counteroffer. $7,500 is a reasonable middle ground between my initial counteroffer and Alice's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to work towards a deal, but I'm not willing to pay more than I think the product is worth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is increasing her offer, but it's still too high. While I'm getting closer to my $10,000 limit, there are still rounds left to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm going to continue moving up my offer, but I'm still trying to keep the price below $8,500.  $8,000 is a good compromise point, showing I'm willing to meet halfway, but I'm not willing to go much higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still too high. It's getting close to my limit, but I still have a few rounds to negotiate. I want to see if I can get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm getting closer to my limit with each round.  I'm willing to meet Alice halfway again by raising my offer to $8,500. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm still trying to get the best possible price.  I have two rounds left, so I need to decide if I want to close the deal or move to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is at my limit, and I have one round left. It's unlikely she'll come down any further, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product entirely.  Buying from John guarantees I get the product, even if it's at the highest price I'm willing to pay."
