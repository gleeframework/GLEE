"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.  There are 9 rounds left, allowing for additional negotiation attempts."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to lower the price by a substantial amount. This strategy is meant to test Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially initiate a more favorable bargaining position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $920,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob still believes he can negotiate further. With 7 rounds left, there's ample time to see if Alice will budge further towards his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 910000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now strategically increasing his counteroffer, making a smaller reduction in the price. This shows Alice that he's serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise.  This approach aims to reach a mutually acceptable price without risking losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been consistently lowering the price and Alice has been meeting him halfway.  While it would be ideal to get the product for $910,000, Alice is now offering $925,000 which is a very good price for Bob. With only 5 rounds remaining,  it’s likely that Alice will not budge further and Bob could end up paying $1,000,000 to Jhon if the negotiations continue. It’s a good time to secure a good deal and avoid the risk of paying the full price to Jhon."
