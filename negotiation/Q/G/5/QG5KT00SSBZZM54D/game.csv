"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value of the product.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement with you, $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down slightly, and I appreciate that. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we are getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,110,000.  This is my final offer, and I think itâ€™s a fair compromise for both of us.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,110,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I propose a price of $1,090,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
