Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,110,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I propose a price of $1,090,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While we could push further, accepting $1,090,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still securing a $90,000 profit above our minimum. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of further negotiation and the potential of Bob walking away.
* **Uncertainty of Future Offers:** There's no guarantee Bob would go higher, and we risk leaving money on the table by being too aggressive."
