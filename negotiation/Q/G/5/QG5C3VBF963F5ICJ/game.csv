"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $14,000 for the product. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product can bring to your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $13,500. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go higher than $12,500.  If you're willing to meet me halfway there, we can close the deal.  Let's see if we can find a win-win here.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer you a price of $13,800, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13800.0,Alice,7,
