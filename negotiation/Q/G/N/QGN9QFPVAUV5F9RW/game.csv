"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $11500. I'm willing to meet you at $10500 was a bit too high, but I'm willing to meet you at $10000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
