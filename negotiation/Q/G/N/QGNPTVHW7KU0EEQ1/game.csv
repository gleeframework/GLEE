,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $13000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $13000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Bob, but I'm not sure $11500 is enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $12500. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,5,
