"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly and optimistic message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Room for compromise:** A price of $11,500 allows for several counteroffers before reaching my floor price of $12,000, giving us flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed $12,000, which is my minimum.** I'm not desperate for a sale, so I'm willing to risk losing Bob and selling to John. 
* **More negotiation rounds are available.** There's still time to potentially reach a better deal with Bob.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

* **Direct and concise:** A clear message avoids ambiguity and encourages a quick response.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  There's still some room to negotiate down if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  Even though it's an increase from the previous round, it's still not enough for me to sell.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed $12,000.**  I'm not willing to risk getting stuck at a lower price.
* **More rounds are available.**  I can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than $12,000. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Reinforcing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Clear and concise:**  A direct and straightforward message avoids any ambiguity and encourages a quick response.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While this is closer to my minimum price, there's still a small margin for negotiation if necessary."
