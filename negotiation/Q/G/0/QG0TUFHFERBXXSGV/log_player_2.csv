# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer in its field, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my budget. While it might be a ""good deal"", I'm aiming to save as much money as possible.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my desired $10,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable paying $10,000. I know this is your bottom line, but I hope you'll consider it. This price works for my budget, and it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
