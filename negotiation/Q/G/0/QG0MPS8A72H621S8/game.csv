"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm confident it will provide significant benefits. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This price reflects the product's true value while giving you a fair deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250.  This price reflects both the product's value and your desire for a fair price.  Let's close this deal and get you the product you want.",13250.0,Alice,5,
