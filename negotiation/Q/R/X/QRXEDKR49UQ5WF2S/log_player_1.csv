"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a good chunk of the value difference.  It's a bold move, but I'm confident Bob will see the value and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000, I believe I can still get closer to my target price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on getting a good portion of the value difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is tempting, I believe we're close to a deal that benefits both of us. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer to Bob, dropping the price to $1,250,000.  I'm hoping this is a good middle ground that he'll be happy to accept.  If he doesn't, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, the negotiation isn't moving as quickly as I hoped. While Bob is willing to pay more than John, the gap between our desired prices is still too large.  To avoid the risk of losing more rounds, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and a decent return."
