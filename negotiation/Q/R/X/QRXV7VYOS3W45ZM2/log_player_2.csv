"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($120). This means there's room for negotiation to get a better price.  It's worth trying to get closer to the $120 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is a $10 reduction from Alice's offer and a good compromise. This price is still higher than the product's worth to Alice, but it's closer to my maximum budget. This makes it more likely Alice will accept, while still saving me money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $145 is only $5 less than what John is selling for. This is not a significant enough price difference to justify further negotiation. It's better to buy from John at $150 rather than risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially end up paying even more."
