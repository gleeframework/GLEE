"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above your target price of saving as much money as possible.  You can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than your initial target of $1,200,000. You have saved $250,000 compared to buying from John, and the negotiation has likely reached a point where further haggling may not be productive. Accepting this offer is a good way to secure the product at a price that is still beneficial to you."
