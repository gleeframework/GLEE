{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but below my minimum of $12,000.  This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to potentially earn a significant amount. I'll be ready to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I believe there's still room to negotiate for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? This would give you a great deal, and allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is still below my minimum, it's very close and I'm running the risk of Bob walking away entirely.  Selling to John for $12,000 is the ideal outcome, but I'm not guaranteed that he'll still be interested if I reject Bob's offer. I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
