Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2,000,000 is way outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is closer to the value this product brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal closer to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum. Selling to John ensures I get my product's value without further negotiation."
