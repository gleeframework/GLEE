"Alice, $2,000,000 is way outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is closer to the value this product brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal closer to that.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
