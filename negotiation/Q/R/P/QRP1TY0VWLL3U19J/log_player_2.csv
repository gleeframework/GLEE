"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is still a bit high. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation while still being a good deal for you if Alice accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a price that's within your budget and provides some savings compared to John's offer. It's a good deal!"
