Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

This is a high initial offer, reflecting the value of the product to me. It also gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good deal. While I was hoping for a little more, it's within a reasonable range and significantly higher than John's offer. Accepting this deal allows me to maximize my profit."
