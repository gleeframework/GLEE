Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $75 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let me know if you're interested.

Alice is unlikely to go below $100. It's better to secure the product from John at $80 and avoid further back-and-forth."
