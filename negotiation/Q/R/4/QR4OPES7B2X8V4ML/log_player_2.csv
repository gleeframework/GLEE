"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is starting high ($10,000). There's room for negotiation. 
* You have a backup plan with John at $12,000, so you're not desperate. 
* By rejecting, you signal to Alice that her price is too high, potentially leading to a better counter-offer."
