{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $130, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $130, knowing Bob values the product at $150. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $130 still allows for a potential compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message makes the offer more appealing and creates a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Lower than My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price range. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $120? It's a fair compromise that still allows you to get a fantastic deal on this product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100,  ensuring I don't lose out on value. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $115 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $115 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited Room for Improvement:**  Further negotiation might result in a slightly higher price, but it's not guaranteed. There's a risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows for a quick sale and avoids further negotiation rounds, which could potentially take longer."
