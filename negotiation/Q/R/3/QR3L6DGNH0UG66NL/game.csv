"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking to keep the cost within my budget. Would you consider $950,000 as a fair offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
