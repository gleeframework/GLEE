Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $60 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $95 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $70?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I can do $75, but that's really the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Bob will go above $75.  It's better to take the guaranteed $80 from John than risk getting less from Bob in the remaining rounds."
