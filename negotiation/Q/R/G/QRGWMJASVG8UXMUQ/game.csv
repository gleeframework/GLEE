"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $1200000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm prepared to come down to $1700000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise for both of us. Let's continue the discussion.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1700000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1400000. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
