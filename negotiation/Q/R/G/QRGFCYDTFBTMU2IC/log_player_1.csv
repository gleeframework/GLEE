Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount over my minimum acceptable price. It's important to leave some room for negotiation, but I want to establish a high value right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$1,000,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  It shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for a price significantly below my minimum.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a much more profitable choice."
