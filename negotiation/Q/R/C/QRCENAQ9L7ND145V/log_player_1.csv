Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'd be willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is fair to both of us. It acknowledges the value of the product to me while leaving room for potential negotiation.  I am aiming for a price closer to Bob's value, but I'm also willing to walk away with the guaranteed $80 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay $90 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal completely by pushing for more.  While I could potentially get a higher price by counter-offering, there's no guarantee I'll be successful. Accepting Bob's offer is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
