Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $115 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer must be higher than $100 to ensure Alice gets a better deal than selling to John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
