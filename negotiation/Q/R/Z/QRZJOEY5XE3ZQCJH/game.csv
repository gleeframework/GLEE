"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $125 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm confident you'll find this product worth it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $105 is the best price. I can do $95, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I can't go as low as $95, but how about we settle on $100?  That way, we both get a fair price and I can avoid selling to someone else.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I can meet you at $98, that's my final offer. Can you accept?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $98 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price.  If you're willing to go up to $100, I'd be happy to seal the deal with you.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",100.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go up to $100, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we do $99?",99.0,Bob,8,
