"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation and potentially a lower price.
* **No risk in rejecting:** Rejecting doesn't mean Bob loses the opportunity. He can always come back with a counteroffer or buy from John. 

By rejecting, Bob keeps his options open and has the opportunity to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, and he knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice. This counteroffer at $1,000,000 represents a significant discount, giving Alice a good reason to consider it while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting this offer means:

* **Saving Money:** Bob gets the product for $1,300,000, which is significantly less than buying from John.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  While there's a chance of pushing Alice down further, the potential gains are smaller and risk delaying the purchase.

At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal and needing to buy from John at a much higher price."
