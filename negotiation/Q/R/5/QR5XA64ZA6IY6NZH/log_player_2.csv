"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I'm willing to let you have it for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's offer of $100, Bob can still do better.  Since the product is only worth $80 to Alice, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price with her."
