"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course!",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $22,000 is a bit too steep for me. While I see the value in your product, my budget is significantly lower.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a substantial return on this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $11,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. I could consider $15,000.  This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
