"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's in my best interest to reject and start negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $22,000 is a bit too steep for me. While I see the value in your product, my budget is significantly lower.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a substantial return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $18,000 is still significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $11,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. I could consider $15,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $15,000 is still above my budget of $8,000. Although we've made some progress, it's unlikely that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to buy the product from John for $8,000, which is the most cost-effective option for me."
