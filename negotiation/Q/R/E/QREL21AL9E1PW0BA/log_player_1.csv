Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable for Bob.  I want to see if I can get close to his maximum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping Bob might be willing to compromise a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value.  I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $125 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my initial asking price than my minimum.  Since I'm not in a rush to sell, it's worth it to avoid further negotiation."
