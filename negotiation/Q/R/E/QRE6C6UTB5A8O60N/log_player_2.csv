You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000 vs. $1,500,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a price closer to what I know the product is worth. I'm happy to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise and still provides you with a healthy profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
