"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $15,000.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best option as it allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $7,500 is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best strategy to see if Alice will budge further."

Bob is increasing his offer, but staying below his maximum. This shows Alice he's serious but still has room to negotiate."
