"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial. I understand its value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's but still above your maximum.** You're willing to spend up to $1,200,000, and Alice is asking for $1,150,000. 
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.** By rejecting, you show Alice that you're serious about getting a better price. This might encourage her to lower her price further, or at least get you closer to your target."
