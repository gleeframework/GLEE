I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1200000 to reflect its exceptional quality and potential for growth.,1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $950000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a price of $1050000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Let me think about it for a moment. Given my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $1000000. This is my maximum offer, and I hope it's within your consideration.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. Considering the product's value and the time we've invested in negotiations, I'm willing to offer a slight concession. I'm now offering the product for $1050000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $50000. This brings the total value to $1100000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline the current offer. I am unable to meet the price of $1100000, including the additional value. My maximum offer remains at $1000000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
