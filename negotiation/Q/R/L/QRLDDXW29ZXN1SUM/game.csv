"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and potential.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, I'm not quite ready to let go of it for $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to counter with $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
