"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet closer to the middle at $12,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but I need to be honest, I've been considering buying the product from John for $15,000 if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price. I'd rather work with you, but I need a better deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
