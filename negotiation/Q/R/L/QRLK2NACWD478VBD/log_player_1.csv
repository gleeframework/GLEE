Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $15,000, aiming slightly below that ($14,000) maximizes potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. This means Alice doesn't have to desperately lowball the price to Bob.
* **Strategic Communication:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and inviting discussion rather than being a hard-line demand."
