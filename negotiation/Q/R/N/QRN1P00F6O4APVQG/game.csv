"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $1,250,000. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of this product.  Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best price for your product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your efforts, but $1,280,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $1,320,000. This is a very fair price, and I hope you can consider it.  If you're serious about buying this product, this is the final number I'm willing to accept.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
