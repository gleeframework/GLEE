"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $10,000. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $10,000.  This is a significantly higher price than Bob is willing to pay. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position but $7,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counter-offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since Bob has 7 more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on this, and I'm offering $8,250.  This is a fair price, considering the value we're both seeing in this product. "", ""product_price"": 8250}
