"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for a price significantly lower than its value to you, and I'll still make a handsome profit. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows you to still make a good profit while giving me a significant discount. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves you with a substantial savings compared to the value you place on the product, and it ensures I can meet my minimum profit.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
