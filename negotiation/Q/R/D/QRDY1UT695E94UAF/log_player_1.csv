"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows you to still make a good profit while giving me a significant discount. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves you with a substantial savings compared to the value you place on the product, and it ensures I can meet my minimum profit.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
