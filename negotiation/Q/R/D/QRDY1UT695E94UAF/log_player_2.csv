"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for a price significantly lower than its value to you, and I'll still make a handsome profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000. There's room for negotiation and potentially a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer, potentially securing a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows you to still make a good profit while giving me a significant discount. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves you with a substantial savings compared to the value you place on the product, and it ensures I can meet my minimum profit.  Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 price from John.  While there's always the potential to negotiate further, accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers, potentially leading to a deadlock or the need to purchase from John at a much higher price."
