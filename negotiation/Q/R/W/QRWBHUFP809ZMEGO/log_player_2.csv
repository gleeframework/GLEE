"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high.  Since I want to save as much money as possible, I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is much higher. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still too high. I'm trying to get the best possible deal, so I'll reject her offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my initial offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the closest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility, and her offer of $725,000 is getting closer to my target price.  While I could continue to negotiate,  I'm getting close to the price John is offering.  It's likely that if I reject this offer, Alice will counter with a higher price, and I'll end up paying more.  Therefore, I'll accept her offer and save $275,000 compared to buying from John."
