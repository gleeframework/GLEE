"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment while providing you with a valuable asset at a price that is below its worth to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.
