"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment while providing you with a valuable asset at a price that is below its worth to you.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I see the value in the product, but $1,000,000 is a little too high for me. How about we meet halfway and settle on $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Alice,3,
