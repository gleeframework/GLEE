{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it's a strong starting point to hopefully maximize my profit. 

I'll be monitoring Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'll counter with a price that's more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm offering $1,600,000. It's a good compromise between what Bob wants and what I'm willing to accept.  I believe this will make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal while still allowing me to earn a substantial amount.  I'm hoping this will be the final price we agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This negotiation has gone on for a while, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob, and it's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  It's time to move on."
