Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
