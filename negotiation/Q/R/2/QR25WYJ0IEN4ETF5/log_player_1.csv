Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down and hopefully still get a good price.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly and open message helps build rapport with Bob and encourages him to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:** I mention the product's uniqueness and value, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 

This approach sets the stage for negotiations, allowing me to see how interested Bob truly is and how high he's willing to go."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to accept.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. By rejecting, I can send a counteroffer that's closer to my target price, hopefully prompting Bob to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique value. "", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still staying relatively close to my target price.
* **Reasoning:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and polite tone to encourage further negotiation. 

This approach demonstrates flexibility while still pushing for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for $1,700,000. I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially considering the limited rounds left. By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer that's more appealing to me. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 as a fallback option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,800,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while you still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a counteroffer at $1,800,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows continued flexibility.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm getting close to my minimum, I still have several rounds left and I don't want to rush into a deal that's too low. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. By rejecting this offer, I can make another counteroffer that might sway Bob. Also, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if I need to."

Round 7

{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this unique product.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,700,000.

* **Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize that this price would be beneficial for both of us.  This appeals to Bob's sense of fairness and may encourage him to accept.

With fewer rounds left, I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal. This offer aims to be a compromise that Bob might accept, especially since he's shown a willingness to negotiate."

Round 8

# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I have two rounds left, and I still believe I can negotiate a higher price.  By rejecting, I can make another counteroffer that might sway Bob, or if it fails, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000. The risk of not closing a deal with Bob is outweighed by the potential to gain a slightly higher price."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there! To close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. It's a very fair price considering the unique value of this product. This is my final offer, and it's a chance for us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making a final counteroffer to Bob, emphasizing that this is the best price I'm willing to offer. This creates a sense of urgency and might push him to accept.
* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Value Justification:** I once again highlight the product's ""unique value"" as a justification for the price. 
* **Mutual Satisfaction:** I frame the offer as a way for both of us to walk away satisfied, appealing to Bob's desire for a mutually beneficial outcome. 

This is a high-stakes round, as I'm nearing the end of negotiations and the risk of not selling to Bob is high. By presenting this offer as my final one and emphasizing its fairness, I hope to encourage Bob to accept. If he doesn't, I'll be ready to sell to John in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away. I'm willing to pay $1580000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you can't accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a crucial decision, as we are in the final round. While Bob's offer is only $80,000 above my minimum, I'm not comfortable risking losing the deal altogether. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Limited Options:**  Rejecting Bob's offer means I either have to make a counteroffer that might be rejected, leaving me with no sale, or sell to John for $1,500,000.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale, securing a price that's significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Time Pressure:** The negotiation is time-sensitive, and I don't want to risk losing both Bob and John as potential buyers.

While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice given the circumstances. It secures a sale and maximizes my earnings, considering the risks associated with further negotiation."
