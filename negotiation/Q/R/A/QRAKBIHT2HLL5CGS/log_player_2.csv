"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than that. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial offer:** My goal is to get the price down to around $9,000, which is closer to Alice's value of $8,000. Starting with $9,500 gives room for negotiation while still being a significant improvement on Alice's initial offer.
* **Message:** A friendly message emphasizes a willingness to compromise while still stating your position.
* **Counteroffer:** $9,500 is a substantial decrease from Alice's offer, showing you're serious about finding a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  $10,000 is still above my ideal price point, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Rejecting for More Negotiation:** I want to see if I can get her down to $9,500 or even closer to $9,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for more rounds of negotiation.
* **Avoiding John:** While John's offer is always an option, it's better to try and secure a better deal with Alice if possible."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit further. I'm willing to offer $9,750.  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to buy the product while still giving you a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This offer splits the difference between Alice's last offer of $10,000 and my previous offer of $9,500. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:**  The message highlights that this price is beneficial for both of us, highlighting the potential win-win situation.
* **Maintain Goal:**  While $9,750 is slightly above my ideal price, it allows for room to negotiate further if necessary, and it's still a significant saving compared to John's offer."
