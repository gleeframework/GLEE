"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not comfortable going down to $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $108? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",108.0,Alice,3,
