,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $9500? I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you a price of $10800. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any higher than $9500, and I'm starting to think it's time to walk away. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but if you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to consider buying from John for $10000.",9500.0,Bob,10,
