"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm thinking of a price around $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too close to my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $110 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's valuation. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject and propose a price closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $92?"",
""product_price"": 92
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between her previous offer and my previous counteroffer. It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
