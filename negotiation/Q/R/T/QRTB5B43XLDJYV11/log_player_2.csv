"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth considering, and I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have room to negotiate since you are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 and John is offering it at that price."

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  I'm still willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and John is offering it at that price, so there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $1,050,000, but I'm still not at a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and I'm starting to feel like the negotiation is getting a bit long.  While there's a chance we could continue to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price,  it's also possible we could get stuck in a cycle of back-and-forth offers. John is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is within my budget and a more certain deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice.  I'm going to choose to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
