"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal at $18000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $18000 is getting closer, I'm still not able to go that high. My final offer is $15000.  If that works for you, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $15000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $17500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to compromise.  However, $17500 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $15000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept, otherwise I'll have to move on to other options.",15000.0,Bob,6,
