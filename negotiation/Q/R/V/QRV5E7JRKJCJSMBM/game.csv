"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet in the middle and pay $1,300,000 for the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, reflecting the unique value this product offers.  This is a fair price considering the market and the potential benefits for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,350,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,275,000 is still below the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to meet you one more time at $1,325,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
