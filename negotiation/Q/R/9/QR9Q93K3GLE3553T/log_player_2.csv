It's not worth buying from Alice for $12,000 when you can get the same product from John for $10,000. You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer is still too high.  You can get the product from John for $10,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10500, but I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11250. I think it's a fair price, considering the value this product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still more than what John is offering. Since you are only willing to spend up to $10,000, it's best to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
