"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I propose a starting price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are looking to spend no more than $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is only $100,000 below that. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Since Alice's offer is above her minimum acceptable price, you have room to negotiate a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You should only go to John if you can't reach a better price with Alice."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective.  However, the value this product brings is truly unique and rare. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise and unlocks significant potential for both of us.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target price.** You are aiming for under $1,500,000 and her offer is still too high.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice is showing some willingness to come down from her initial price. You can likely get a better deal with another counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  You haven't exhausted your options with Alice yet."
