"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind.  To be frank, I'm working with a budget closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider an offer in that range?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but $700,000 is simply too far from where we need to be for this to make sense for me.  This product has significant potential, and I'm confident it can deliver substantial value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession on my part, reflecting my desire to find common ground.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big leap from my ideal price point.  Perhaps we can find some middle ground.  Would you consider $900,000?  I'm serious about making this work, but I need to be realistic about the numbers.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this, and I understand the need to find a price that works for both of us. Let's be real, though - we're both aware this product has the potential to generate significant returns.  To meet you halfway, I'm prepared to offer it for $1,650,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial opportunity.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we both see the value in this product. But I need to be upfront â€“ your final offer is still a stretch for my budget. I can go as high as $1,100,000, but that's absolutely my limit. It's a strong offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
