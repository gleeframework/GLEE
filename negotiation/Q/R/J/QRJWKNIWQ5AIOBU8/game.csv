"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I have to be honest, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $900000. I think that's a fair price for a product that's supposed to be a game-changer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you think it's a game-changer. However, I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. I think that's a fair price for a product that's supposed to be a game-changer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I like your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $950000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be honest, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975000. I think that's a fair price for a product that I'm really interested in.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more. I'm thinking of a price of $1025000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980000. I think that's a fair price for a product that I'm really interested in, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",980000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're running out of room to maneuver, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1020000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I'm hoping you'll meet me there. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but $1020000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1000000.",990000.0,Bob,10,
