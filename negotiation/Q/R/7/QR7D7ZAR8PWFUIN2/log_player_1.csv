"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a risky move, but it allows for some potential negotiation room and could potentially earn me a higher price.  I'm also considering that 10 rounds are a lot, and I can always fall back to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I have 8 rounds left and can continue to negotiate with Bob.  Selling to John right now would be a waste of potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's initial offer, giving me some room to make a profit.  It's a balance between being aggressive and finding common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still less than my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it saves me time and potential negotiation headaches. The risk of continuing negotiations is that we might not reach an agreement, leaving me with only John's offer.  With 6 rounds left, I'm content to secure a good profit and move on."
