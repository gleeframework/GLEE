{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This gives Alice a chance to consider the offer, while also demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his desired range. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob doesn't want to settle for a price that's significantly higher than his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows that he is willing to pay more but still aims for a price below Alice's latest offer. This approach allows him to continue the negotiation while trying to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's approaching the price he'd pay from John.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Alice will become too inflexible, or the negotiation will drag on and Bob will miss out on a good opportunity. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's within his budget and lower than John's price."
