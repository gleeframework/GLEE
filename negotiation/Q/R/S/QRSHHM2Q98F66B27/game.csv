"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial returns exceeding the difference in our valuations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. While I respect the value you place on this product, my budget constraints remain firm. I am unable to increase my offer beyond $1,250,000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreeable solution.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I believe we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,280,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,280,000 exceeds my budget by a significant margin. I would like to propose $1,260,000 as my final offer. I hope this proposal enables us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
