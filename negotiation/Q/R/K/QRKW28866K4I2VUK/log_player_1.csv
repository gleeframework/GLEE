Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Create Urgency:** By emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity,""  the offer subtly implies that if Bob doesn't take it, someone else will."
