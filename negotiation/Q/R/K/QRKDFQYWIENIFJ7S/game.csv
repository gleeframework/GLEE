"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that still benefits both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's make it happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
