"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth more than what you've offered. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $1,125,000?  This feels like a good middle ground for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still think the product's value is worth more than $1,125,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,140,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1140000.0,Alice,5,
