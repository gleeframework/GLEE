"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product, we provide a reason for the high initial price without explicitly stating our minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""a fair starting point"" signals to Bob that we're open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. Considering the market value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate. We are aiming for a price as close to $1,600,000 as possible. Rejecting this offer signals that we're looking for a better deal while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear you recognize the value of this product. To move us closer, I'm proposing a price of $1,550,000. I believe this strikes a balance that considers its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We've reduced our price significantly from the initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Hold Firm:** However, we're not dropping our price too drastically.  We're still above Bob's offer by a substantial amount, signaling that we value the product highly. 
* **Justification:**  Again, we reiterate the ""true worth"" to anchor the price point in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given your proposal careful consideration, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $1,500,000, which is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer ensures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
