"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as it aligns with my current valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a significant offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the minimum price I need to accept to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
