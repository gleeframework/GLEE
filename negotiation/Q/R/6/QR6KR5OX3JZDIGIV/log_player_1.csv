Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and still ensures a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer than my initial offer. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm raising the price slightly to $11,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a profit closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and avoids further negotiation. Accepting this offer is the best option for a quick and profitable sale."
