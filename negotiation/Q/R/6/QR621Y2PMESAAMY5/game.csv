,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can we meet somewhere in between?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, $11,000 is still quite low for what this product offers. How about we settle at $12,500?  This feels like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still think $12,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
