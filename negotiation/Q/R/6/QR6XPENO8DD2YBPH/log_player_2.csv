Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you need more information to consider it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, so $950,000 is a good starting point but it's still too high for your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.

Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is very close to your budget, and you can still save some money compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal given the circumstances."
