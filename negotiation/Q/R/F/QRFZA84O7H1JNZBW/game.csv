"Bob, I have a product that I believe could be extremely valuable to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $1250000.  This is a significant discount and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1050000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1050000 is closer to my desired range, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000, which reflects the value you see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for me. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your final decision.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
