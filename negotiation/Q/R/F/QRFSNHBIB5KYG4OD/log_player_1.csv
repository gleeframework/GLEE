Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is higher than Bob's valuation of $10,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:** $12,000 is below your minimum of $15,000, but it allows for the possibility of a successful negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is friendly and straightforward, and the price is stated clearly. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation that could ultimately lead to a successful sale for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob, as I have the option to sell to John for significantly more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $10,250. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,250 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John. I'm willing to take one more risk and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $10,250 is still below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is my final offer. If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 11500}
