"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

While $100 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum price point.  You should reject her offer and see if you can get her down further."
