Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. I think it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $130 is a reasonable starting point, and it's likely Bob will be willing to negotiate from here.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still lower my price slightly if necessary. I also have the option of going to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to lower my price slightly, but I won't accept anything below my minimum.
* **Sell to John as a backup:**  I'm keeping the option to sell to John open as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:** I'm lowering my price from $130 to $100, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm not compromising too much.
* **Keep negotiation open:**  I'm keeping the negotiation open, hoping Bob will accept my counteroffer. 
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** I'm still aware of my option to sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, his offer is still far from my desired price. 
* **John's offer is more attractive:**  John is willing to pay $150, which is significantly better than Bob's offer.
* **Minimizing risk:**  By selling to John, I can guarantee myself a profit that is higher than what I would make by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

It's better to take the guaranteed profit from John than to risk further negotiations with Bob that may not lead to a favorable outcome."
