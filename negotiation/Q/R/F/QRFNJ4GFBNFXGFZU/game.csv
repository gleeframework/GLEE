"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle on a price of $8,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,000 is the absolute minimum you're willing to pay, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $14,000. It's still a discount from my initial offer, but it's a more reasonable price for me. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
