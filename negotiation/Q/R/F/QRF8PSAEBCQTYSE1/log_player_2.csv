"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, it's worth exploring if you can get a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12000 is a good offer, it's a little lower than I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to go up to $13000? This is a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth it for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, so it's still worth trying to get a lower price.  Rejecting her offer allows for another counteroffer and potentially getting the product for closer to your desired $12,000."
