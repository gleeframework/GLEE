"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do like the product, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for this product. It holds significant value and I'm confident you'd find it well worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you consider $12,000? I believe that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
