"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do like the product, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly below its value to me.  I need to negotiate for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for this product. It holds significant value and I'm confident you'd find it well worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you consider $12,000? I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a good offer from Bob, as it meets his maximum valuation. Let's analyze the options:

1. **Accepting** guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of losing both buyers.
2. **Rejecting** might lead to a higher offer, but Bob could walk away, leaving me with John's offer.
3. **Selling to John** secures the minimum profit, but we might be able to get more from Bob.

Considering the potential gain versus risk, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice now.
