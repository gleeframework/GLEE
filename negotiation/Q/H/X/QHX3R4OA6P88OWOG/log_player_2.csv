"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within your budget and saves you $200,000 compared to Alice's offer."
