"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $130. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $130.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity. However, $130 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$120 is a good price for you and still allows Alice to make a profit. There's no need to risk a further counteroffer and potentially lose the deal."
