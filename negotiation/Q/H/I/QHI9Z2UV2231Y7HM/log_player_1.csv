Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the potential benefits it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal and move forward.

However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty on the product, which is a $50,000 value. So, I'm effectively offering you a deal worth $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
