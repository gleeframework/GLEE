"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the potential benefits it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty on the product, which is a $50,000 value. So, I'm effectively offering you a deal worth $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
