Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I explore other offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  While you know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other offers,"" you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Aiming High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above John's offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
