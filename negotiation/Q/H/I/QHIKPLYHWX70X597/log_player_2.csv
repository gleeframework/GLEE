"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely get a better price, either from Alice or from John. 
```"

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go up to $900,000 just yet. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but we're getting close to John's price.  We'll push a little further, but we may need to accept her next offer or go with John."

Round 7

# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to compromise again, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
