"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not immediately going for my minimum of $1,200,000 as it leaves no room for Bob to feel like he got a good deal.
* **Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a great price, emphasizing the value Bob will get. 
* **Open Ended:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate. I can counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground.
* **Not Selling to John Yet:** While John's offer is tempting, I still have 9 rounds left and can potentially get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $950,000 to make this work.  This is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's keep talking and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Higher Price:** I'm counter-offering at $950,000, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to a middle ground.
* **Maintain a Firm Stance:** I'm not dropping too much, as it shows I'm serious about my desired price.
* **Emphasize Value and Deal:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and reiterating that this is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintain Open Communication:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation and emphasizing finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and your willingness to compromise. I hope you'll find this acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe there's still room to negotiate further and get closer to my goal. 
* **Not Selling to John Yet:**  I'm hesitant to sell to John right now because I'm only 4 rounds in, and I believe I can still secure a better price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Agreement:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price point that's closer to my target.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress.  However, $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. I'm willing to offer $910,000. This is a fair compromise considering both of our positions.  Let's see if we can close this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, $910,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **More Rounds Left:** With 4 rounds remaining, there's still time to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Not Selling to John Yet:** I don't want to miss out on the potential to get closer to my target price with Bob, even though John's offer is tempting."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're close, but $910,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $915,000 as a final compromise.  This reflects both the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations.  Let's finalize this deal and make it a win-win."", ""product_price"": 915000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm presenting this offer as a final compromise, signaling that I'm willing to close the deal at a slightly lower price than I initially hoped for. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $915,000 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer while still being above my initial minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value and Progress:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting the progress made in the negotiations to encourage acceptance. 
* **Closing Language:** I'm using language like ""finalize this deal"" and ""win-win"" to create a sense of urgency and finality."
