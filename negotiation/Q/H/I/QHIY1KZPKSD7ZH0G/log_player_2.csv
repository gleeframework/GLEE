Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're close, but $910,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $915,000 as a final compromise.  This reflects both the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations.  Let's finalize this deal and make it a win-win. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000.
