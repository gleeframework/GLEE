"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this investment.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $9,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both benefit from this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
