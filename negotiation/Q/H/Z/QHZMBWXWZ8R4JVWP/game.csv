"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you say?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you at $95. It's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",95.0,Alice,5,
