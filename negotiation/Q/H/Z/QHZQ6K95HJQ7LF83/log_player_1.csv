Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if he counter-offers.  However, it's not so high that it's immediately out of the question for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $100. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counter-offering at $105. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $95. While it's still below my initial target, it's above my minimum value of $100.  It's also a good compromise that allows me to avoid further negotiation and avoid the risk of Bob backing out or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
