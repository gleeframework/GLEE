"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I've done some research, and I think that's a fair price considering the market value. Can you meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I have to say that $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $9500? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9500. How about we meet at $9250? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, Alice, but I still need to make a bit of a dent. How about we meet at $9000 again? I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the market value. Can you meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9300. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $9200? This is a final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9200 and my original offer of $8000. How about we meet at $9000 again? I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the market value. Can you meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $9200. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. How about we meet at $9150? This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",9150.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9000. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'll make one final offer: $9000 or I'll buy the product from John for $10000. That's my last offer.",9000.0,Bob,10,
