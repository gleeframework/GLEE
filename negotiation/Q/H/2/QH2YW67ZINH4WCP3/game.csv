,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. This product would be a great fit for me, but I need a price that aligns with my budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer to my budget, how about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $75, which would be $82.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I can do $80, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be as flexible as possible, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $80. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer, so I'll meet you at $85. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",85.0,Alice,7,
