Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, starting with a price slightly below your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value,"" Alice subtly suggests the price is justified, even if Bob doesn't perceive the full $145 worth.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still having a chance for Bob to accept. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the security of John's $150 offer."
