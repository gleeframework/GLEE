"I appreciate your competitive offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700000 for the product. I believe this price is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and propose a price of $712500 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",712500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're willing to make one last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer and consider other options. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $800000, which is the original price I was looking for. If you're still interested, I can give you one last chance to match that price. Otherwise, I'll have to move forward with the sale to John.",800000.0,Alice,9,
