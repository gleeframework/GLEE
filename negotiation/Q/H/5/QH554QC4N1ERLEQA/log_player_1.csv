Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure the Higher Sale:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, Bob's higher valuation makes him the more profitable target. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob could reject the offer, but the potential for a significantly higher sale price makes it a risk worth taking."
