"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my target.  I'll keep an eye on Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer, but still higher than my minimum. Hopefully, this shows flexibility and encourages him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better price. I have several rounds left and John is always an option if this deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to stick to my strategy of offering a price closer to Bob's but still higher than my minimum. If he continues to reject my offers, I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I have some room to be firm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm running out of rounds, but I'm still not going to settle for less than $9,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm lowering my offer a bit to show I'm willing to be flexible but I still want to close the deal. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it's close to his offer.  If he rejects it, I can always go to John, but I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiations, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'll sell to John for $10,000, as that's a guaranteed price that meets my minimum."
