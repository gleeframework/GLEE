"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  I understand your offer, but $60 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $90 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
