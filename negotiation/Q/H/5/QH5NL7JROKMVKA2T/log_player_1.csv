"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think you'd be a perfect buyer. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  I understand your offer, but $60 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $90 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
