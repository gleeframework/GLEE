Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $150 might seem too aggressive and could lead to an immediate rejection. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net, ensuring Alice doesn't need to go below that price."
