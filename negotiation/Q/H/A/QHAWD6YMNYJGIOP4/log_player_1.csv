"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today.  I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $200 to start.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $180?  It's a high-quality product that you'll really enjoy."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John, our backup buyer.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go higher. We can secure the $150 by selling to John."
