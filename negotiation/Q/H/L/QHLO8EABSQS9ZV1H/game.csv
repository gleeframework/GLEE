"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $18000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $16000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a solution.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering you a new price of $17500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
