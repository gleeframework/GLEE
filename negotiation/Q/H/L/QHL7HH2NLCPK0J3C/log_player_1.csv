Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is more than your minimum of $800,000, so you're already getting a good deal.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation and a potential win-win.
* **It sets the tone:**  By starting high, you leave room to come down slightly during negotiations while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum, it's considerably lower than your initial offer. Rejecting it allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** You've shown you're not desperate for a sale.
* **Potentially improve the price:** You can counter with a price closer to your desired amount.
* **Explore further:**  By continuing the negotiation, you might learn more about Bob's motivations and maximum willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting the significant value this product offers.  I believe this price is still fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** This price is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterate the product's value:**  This helps remind Bob of the worth of the product and potentially incentivizes him to come up in price.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  $900,000 is still a good price for you, leaving room for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered the situation, and I would like to propose an offer of $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects its value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is:

* **Above your minimum:**  It's $75,000 more than what you'd get from John.
* **Close to your desired price:** You've already moved from $950,000 to $900,000. Accepting now avoids further back-and-forth that might lead to a lower price.
* **Indicates a potential deal:** Bob seems willing to negotiate but is also setting a limit. Accepting might be the best way to secure the sale. 

While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing Bob entirely, especially if he's genuinely at his budget limit."
