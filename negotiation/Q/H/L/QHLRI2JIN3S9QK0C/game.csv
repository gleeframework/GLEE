"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another seller.",100.0,Bob,4,
