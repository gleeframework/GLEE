"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's something that I'm confident could significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you for $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth. I'm eager to discuss this further and answer any questions you may have. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your $1,000,000 maximum, it's still a significant amount above Alice's valuation of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. You can then counter-offer or wait to see if she'll come down on her price. You'll still have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
