"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really only looking to spend around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable accepting.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  $9,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  However, I'm willing to go down to $9,500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,5,
