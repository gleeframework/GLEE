"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the value you'll get from the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a compromise at $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
