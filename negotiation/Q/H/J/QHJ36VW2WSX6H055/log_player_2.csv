"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is offering it for $950,000. This saves you $50,000.
* **John's offer is your fallback.** While John's offer is still within your budget, it's less advantageous than Alice's offer."
