"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I have 8 rounds left and there's still potential to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $1,300,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a price we can both agree on. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. I can do $1,150,000. That's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still have 6 rounds left and I believe I can get closer to $1,500,000.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This would be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
