"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  To be honest, that price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your willingness to be flexible, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Alice,5,
