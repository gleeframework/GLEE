"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is quite high.  There's plenty of room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but she's still above my fallback price with John. I need to push her a bit further down to see if there's more room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is holding firm at $8,500, and even though she says it's her final offer, there's no guarantee she won't come down a little more.  However, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  I can get the product from John for $8,000 right now, which is a guaranteed saving."
