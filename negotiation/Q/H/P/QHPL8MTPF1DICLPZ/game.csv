"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the $900,000 offer is a significant step away from what I had in mind. This product has tremendous value, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial returns. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can we meet at this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $975,000 is still a significant gap from my bottom line. To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, but I'm hoping we can get even closer to a mutually beneficial price.",990000.0,Bob,6,
