Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $9,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,000? That would be more within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Since my minimum acceptable price is $8,000,  and Bob has offered that amount, it makes sense to accept.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price, there's no guarantee that I could have negotiated a better deal, and I risk losing the sale entirely if I keep counter-offering.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and secure sale at my minimum price."
