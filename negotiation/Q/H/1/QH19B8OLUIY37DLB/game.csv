"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is considerably below its true value. This product offers you a significant competitive advantage, and I'm confident you'll recoup your investment quickly. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but I have a budget in mind.  I can go up to $750,000. This is a fair offer considering we're still early in negotiations.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However,  $750,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. To be fair to both of us,  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $787,500? This would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",787500.0,Bob,6,
