"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $14,000 for this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above my ideal price point. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can use that to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to offer $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my target, I'm still within the first few rounds and have room to negotiate further. I'll try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $12,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I am willing to accept $12,800 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,800, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $12,500.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm getting close to my budget and don't want to risk losing the deal.  It's better to accept the offer and avoid the chance of Alice getting more stubborn or me having to buy from John at a higher price."
