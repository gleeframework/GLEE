Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique chance to acquire it before anyone else. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob, should he counter-offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product to entice Bob and justify the price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a public listing creates a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob an attractive proposition compared to his perceived value of $800,000."
