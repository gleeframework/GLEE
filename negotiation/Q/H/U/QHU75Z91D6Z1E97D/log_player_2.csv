"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* While $800,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  
*  Rejecting allows Bob to explore getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for me and still allows you a substantial profit."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $750,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,000,000.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and potentially ending the negotiations is high. 
*  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the potential for further delays or complications."
