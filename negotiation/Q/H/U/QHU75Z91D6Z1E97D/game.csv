"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for me and still allows you a substantial profit.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
