Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies that Bob would be getting a fair price even at $10,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While Alice has John as a backup, it's strategically better to not mention him. Introducing competition could make Bob less likely to negotiate. 
* **Polite and Open-Ended:** The tone is crucial. By being polite and asking ""What do you think?"", Alice invites Bob to engage in a discussion rather than just giving a simple ""yes"" or ""no."""
