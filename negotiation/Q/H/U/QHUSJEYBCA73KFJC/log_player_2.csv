"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a product worth $1,000,000 to you for a lower price, and I secure a sale that's still very profitable for me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more to Alice."
