"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's only fair to propose a price of $950,000 for this exceptional item.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  You want to save as much as possible and $950,000 is still significantly more than the product is worth to Alice. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, reflecting the value I see in it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
