"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is within your budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  There's room to negotiate for a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $135.  I believe that's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and your desired selling point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by offering a price closer to the midpoint between Alice's desired price and your maximum price. This shows you're willing to negotiate but are also serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm looking for something closer to $140.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is willing to compromise, which shows she's open to a deal. Rejecting allows us to counter again, aiming for a price closer to $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle on $137.50? It's a good middle ground and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 137.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a further willingness to compromise while still staying close to your desired price point. The offer of $137.50 is halfway between Alice's offer of $140 and your previous offer of $135, demonstrating a genuine desire to reach a mutually agreeable price."
