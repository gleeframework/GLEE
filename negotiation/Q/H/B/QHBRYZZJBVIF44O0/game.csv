"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,200?",10200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,200. I can meet you halfway at $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit. How about we settle at $10,600? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $10,600 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I can do $11,250, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I have a budget I need to stick to. My absolute final offer is $10,800.  Let me know if that works for you.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I need to consider other options. Let me make you one final offer: $11,400. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to move on.",11400.0,Alice,7,
