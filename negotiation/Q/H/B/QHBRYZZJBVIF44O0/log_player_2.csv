Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,200. I can meet you halfway at $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $10,600 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I can do $11,250, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I need to consider other options. Let me make you one final offer: $11,400. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems like Alice is not budging much below $11,400.  At this point, it's better to cut losses and buy from John for $12,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice might waste more rounds and potentially lead to a worse outcome if she refuses to budge."
