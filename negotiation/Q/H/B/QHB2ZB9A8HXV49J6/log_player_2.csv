Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's still above his target price of $1,000,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can still buy from John for a lower price, Alice has come down to $1,075,000 which is within Bob's budget and closer to his target price than John's offer. It's a good deal, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
