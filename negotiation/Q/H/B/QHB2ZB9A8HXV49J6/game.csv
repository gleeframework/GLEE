"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit. I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
