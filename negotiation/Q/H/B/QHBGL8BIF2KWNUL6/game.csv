"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $12,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $15,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. ",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13,500 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if you accept.",13500.0,Bob,4,
