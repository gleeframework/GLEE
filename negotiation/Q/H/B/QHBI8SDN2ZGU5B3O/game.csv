"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, so I can do $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $85.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I still think $100 is a fair price considering the product's value. I can meet you halfway between $85 and $100, which would be $92.50. That's the best I can do.",92.5,Alice,5,
