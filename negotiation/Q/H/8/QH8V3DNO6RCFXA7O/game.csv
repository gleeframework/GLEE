"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product's value, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find a compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'd like to try to meet you halfway. How about we aim for $1,050,000? This would allow us to both feel satisfied with the transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. ",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'll do my best to meet you closer to my budget. How about we aim for $1,025,000? This would allow us to both move forward with the deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your financial limitations.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's my absolute final offer.  This price is still significantly above your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'll make one last attempt to align our prices. How about we settle on $1,035,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1035000.0,Bob,8,
