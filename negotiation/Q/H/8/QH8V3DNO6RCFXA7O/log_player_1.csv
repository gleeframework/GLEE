"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product's value, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John.  While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm confident I can get a better deal with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'd like to try to meet you halfway. How about we aim for $1,050,000? This would allow us to both feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to settle. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have more rounds left."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'll do my best to meet you closer to my budget. How about we aim for $1,025,000? This would allow us to both move forward with the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure to make a deal, I'm still not convinced this is the best I can get.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob a little further. If that fails, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial limitations.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's my absolute final offer.  This price is still significantly above your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'll make one last attempt to align our prices. How about we settle on $1,035,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,035,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,035,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision. I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer, but we're down to the wire.  While I could try for one more counteroffer, there's no guarantee he'll accept.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, and I'd rather not risk losing out on that opportunity."
