"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's seriousness. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price acts as an anchor. While Bob might not accept it, it sets a high reference point for the rest of the negotiation. 
* **Confidence:** A strong opening offer displays confidence in your product's value. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first move in a strategic negotiation. We will adjust our approach based on Bob's responses and the progression of the rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a very attractive price for you considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than his stated value of $1,000,000, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below Our Minimum:** Accepting $1,200,000 would be below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Early Stage:** It's still early in the negotiation, and we have leverage with John's offer as a backup.

We will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bring the price closer to our desired range while keeping Bob engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. It seems we have some ground to cover to find a mutually beneficial agreement. While your offer is appreciated, the product's value significantly exceeds that figure. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** We are making a substantial reduction from our initial price to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The new offer keeps us comfortably above our minimum acceptable price while allowing room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** We are re-emphasizing the product's value to justify the price, even with the reduction. 

We are aiming to gauge Bob's reaction to this counteroffer and adjust our strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your offer, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both sides. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches Our Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches our absolute minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strong Position:**  While we could try to push for more, we are in a strong negotiating position, and Bob has significantly increased his offer.
* **Time Factor:**  We are four rounds in, and dragging out the negotiation further risks Bob walking away or lowering his offer. 

Accepting this offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable profit and avoids the potential risks of continued negotiation."
