"Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a very attractive price for you considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your offer, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both sides.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
