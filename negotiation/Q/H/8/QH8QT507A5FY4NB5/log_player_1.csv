I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point, giving Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a substantial profit. I'm eager to see if he finds the value proposition compelling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $999,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price and wouldn't allow me to achieve my desired profit. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get more,  I'm happy to accept this offer. It's a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale."
