Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is more than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** $10,000 is still above your minimum of $12,000, so you're not giving it away.

I'm ready to negotiate further if Bob rejects the offer. I'll keep in mind that John is willing to pay $12,000, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiating, I won't accept an offer that's so far below my minimum. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price that's more favorable for me but still attractive enough for Bob to consider.  I'll also keep in mind that John is willing to pay $12,000, so I have a strong backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500).  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:** $9,250 is still above my minimum value of $12,000, so I'm not giving away the product for a loss. 
* **Appeal to Bob:** The message emphasizes that $9,250 is still a good deal for Bob, giving him a reason to consider my counteroffer. 

I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm committed to selling the product for at least that amount.

I will make a final counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap further.  If Bob rejects that offer, I'll  move forward with selling the product to John for $12,000, as it's a sure deal that meets my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 as a final offer. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to move on to another buyer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm stating that this is my final offer, adding pressure for Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Fair Price:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price for both of us. This helps to avoid a feeling of being pressured or taken advantage of.
* **Consequences:** I'm stating the consequences of rejection, which is that I'll move on to another buyer. This reinforces the urgency of the offer.

I'm hoping this final offer will be acceptable to Bob. If not, I'm ready to sell the product to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make one more attempt at a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's the best I can do, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I've already made significant concessions and am not willing to drop my price further.  It's clear that we can't reach an agreement, and I'm not comfortable with the risk of continuing to negotiate. 

I've made a good faith effort to work with Bob, but I need to secure a sale that meets my minimum requirements. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees that my minimum value is met, and it's a sure thing compared to the uncertainty of continued negotiations with Bob."
