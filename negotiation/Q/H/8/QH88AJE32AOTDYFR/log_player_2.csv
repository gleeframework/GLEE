It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $8,500 is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get it even lower."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget. I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

Alice has moved a little closer to my offer, but I'm still hoping for a lower price. I'll reject and try another counteroffer."

This is a good deal for me, considering my maximum budget is $12,000 and John is selling it for that price. I'm saving $4,200 by accepting Alice's offer."
