"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000?  That's a substantial offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is a respectable offer, it doesn't reflect the full value of what this product can do for you. To move this forward, I could accept $825,000.  This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $787,500.  This is a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit.",787500.0,Bob,6,
