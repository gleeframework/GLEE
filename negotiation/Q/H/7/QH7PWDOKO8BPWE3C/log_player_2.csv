"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, as I could easily sell it to someone else for $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you.  
* While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, you know you have a backup option with John. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for negotiation or allows you to proceed with John's guaranteed price."
