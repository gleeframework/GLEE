"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This gives you a great deal and allows me to recoup some of the value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $600,000 is a big jump. How about we try $750,000? That's a significant move on my end, and it brings us closer to a fair deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $750,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000. Let's split the difference and try $875,000. This price acknowledges your interest while still allowing me to recoup a reasonable amount of the value of the product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we try $825,000?  That's a significant compromise for me, and it bridges the gap even further.",825000.0,Bob,6,
