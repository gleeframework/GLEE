```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, but shows a genuine attempt to reach a deal. It is likely that Alice will be willing to accept this offer, as it is closer to her ideal price point than John's price."
