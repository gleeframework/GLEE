# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is stuck on $1,200,000.  While that's a decent price, I still have room to negotiate and get it down further. I'm not ready to accept her offer yet, but I also don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'll continue to negotiate in the next round."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1,175,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get the price down even further, Alice is showing a willingness to meet halfway.  $1,175,000 is a good price considering the product's value to me and the fact that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's also a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. It's time to accept and close the deal."
