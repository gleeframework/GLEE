"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $12,500? This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal on this valuable product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,5,
