"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my investment. Let's try $9,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your investment, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,200 is above my minimum price of $8,000 and is getting closer to my desired value.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob will walk away, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than selling to John for $8,000.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this round."
