"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Would you consider $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $9,875? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,875 is very close to your last offer, and I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $10,000 even? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
