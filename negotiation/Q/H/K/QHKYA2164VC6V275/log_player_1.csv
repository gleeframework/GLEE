Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $19,000,  let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of potential value. 
* **Justification:**  While I don't explicitly state why the price is so high, the vague statement about it being ""highly beneficial"" is designed to prompt Bob to consider potential uses or value he may have overlooked.
* **Backup Plan:** I know John provides a safety net, allowing me to be more ambitious in my initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. If Bob is turned off by the high price and refuses to negotiate, I lose the opportunity for a deal with him. However, the potential reward of securing a price significantly above my minimum makes this risk worthwhile."
