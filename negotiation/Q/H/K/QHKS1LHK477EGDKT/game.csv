"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I recognize its potential value,  $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Would you be willing to consider $800000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
