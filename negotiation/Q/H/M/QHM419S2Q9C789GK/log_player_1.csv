Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $19,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so any price significantly above that is unlikely to be accepted.
* **John's Guaranteed Purchase:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $15,000. This is your ""safety net.""
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer of $19,000 allows room for negotiation. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this initial price, it sets a high anchor point. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can gauge his interest and potentially negotiate down towards a price that's still significantly higher than your guaranteed $15,000.

**Important:** It's crucial to present the offer confidently, highlighting the product's value to justify the price."
