"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly above both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as justified due to the product's ""value and potential."" 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By calling it an ""initial proposal"" and a ""starting point,"" I signal to Bob that I'm open to negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts this high initial offer, it's a huge win.
2. **Gather Information:**  Bob's response will give me insights into his valuation and negotiation style. 
3. **Control the Negotiation:** Starting high gives me more control over the direction of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next few rounds.  I'm willing to leverage the potential deal with John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the unique value proposition of this product, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle at $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession but Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and make a concession by lowering my price. However, the decrease is relatively small, signaling that I'm still aiming for a higher price.
* **Justification:** I reiterate the ""unique value proposition"" to remind Bob of the product's worth.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer aims to meet Bob somewhere in the middle between his offer ($1,200,000) and my previous asking price ($1,500,000). 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By not accepting his offer outright, I keep the John option open as leverage, even though it's not explicitly stated."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the price is right. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but his increments are getting smaller.  While I could push for a bit more, accepting his offer of $1,250,000 is a solid deal. 

Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly above my minimum acceptable price and provides a $50,000 profit over my guaranteed sale to John.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids further rounds of negotiation and potential delays. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's offer might lead to a more positive business relationship in the future."
