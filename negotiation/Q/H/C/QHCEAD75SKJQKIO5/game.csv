"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth it.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $95?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer it to you for $105. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it worth it.",105.0,Alice,5,
