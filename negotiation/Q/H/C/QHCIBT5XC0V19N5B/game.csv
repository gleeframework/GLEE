"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To show my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This price reflects the significant value this product holds, while still being within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's work together to reach a final agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
