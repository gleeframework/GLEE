Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (your minimum acceptable price), starting higher allows room for negotiation without risking a loss.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential desire for a worthwhile investment.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a sense of urgency and desirability. 

This approach aims to maximize your potential profit while still providing room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer."
