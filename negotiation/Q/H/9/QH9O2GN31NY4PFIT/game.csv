"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $600,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,
