I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start the conversation with an initial offer of $1,000,000 for the product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
