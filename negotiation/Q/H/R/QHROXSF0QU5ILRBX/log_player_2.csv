Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, $875,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We're at Round 5 of 10. While we have time, Alice has indicated this is her final offer. 
* **Price Difference:**  The difference between Alice's offer ($925,000) and John's price ($1,000,000) is now $75,000. It's becoming riskier to keep negotiating for a smaller potential saving.
* **Finality:** Alice using the phrase ""final offer"" suggests she's unlikely to move much further.

It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk the negotiations breaking down and potentially having to settle for John's price."
