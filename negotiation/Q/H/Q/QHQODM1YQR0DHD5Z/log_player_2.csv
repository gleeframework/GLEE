"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $150 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you for $135. This is a special offer considering its high value to you and my desire to make a sale. I believe this price offers a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($135 < $150).**
* **You're saving $15 compared to buying from John.** 

Even though Alice is asking more than the product is worth to her ($135 > $100),  it's still a good deal for you since you're getting it for less than your maximum price."
