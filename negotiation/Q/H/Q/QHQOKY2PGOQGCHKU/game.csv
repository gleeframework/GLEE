"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention.  However, I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to get a better price, but I have to make a living, you know! I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $850000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to purchase the product within my budget. Let's make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $810000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",810000.0,Alice,5,
