"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$6,000 is a good price**, but we can likely get it lower.  
* **There's no harm in trying to negotiate.**  We have 10 rounds, so we can afford to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** I'm offering significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still a considerable amount of money. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and give me a better understanding of her bottom line. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I've left room for Alice to counter with a price somewhere between my offer and her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** $5,000 is a significant savings from Alice's initial offer and a reasonable price compared to John's offer.
* **Limited time:**  We are on round 3, and it's important to start securing the product. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice getting impatient or finding another buyer, and we might end up paying more in the long run."
