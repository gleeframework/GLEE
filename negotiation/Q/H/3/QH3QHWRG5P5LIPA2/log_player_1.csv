Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is above Bob's perceived value ($10,000), but not excessively so. This might pique his interest and potentially lead to a counter-offer.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""significant value"", ""benefit you greatly"") can sometimes make a higher price more palatable.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might outright reject this offer, knowing his value is lower. However, the strategy aims to maximize potential profit, and you always have the safety net of John's offer."
