"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $10000 to us, but I understand its value to you might be around $8000. Considering this, I propose to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet within our valuation range. Considering our costs and the market value, I would like to offer the product to you for $9000. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. He should continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  There are still 7 rounds remaining, so there's time to try to get a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $8,750, which is closer to my maximum. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer the product to you for $8900. This is the lowest price we can go while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to conclude this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his budget limit at $8,900. However, he can still try to negotiate a slightly lower price. There are 5 rounds remaining, and even if he fails, he can always buy from John.  The risk of missing out on a better deal is still higher than the potential savings from accepting Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $8,900 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $8,800. This would allow us to both close the deal and feel good about the outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and flexibility, Bob. After reviewing our costs and considering your proposal, I am willing to offer the product to you for $8850. This is the lowest price we can go while still ensuring a fair profit for us. I hope this meets your requirements and helps us to finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,850 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While there are still 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not getting a better deal is high.  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might not budge further, and he might be forced to buy from John at $8,000. Accepting this offer gives Bob the product for a slightly higher price, but it ensures he gets the product and avoids a potential loss."
