"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You are willing to pay up to $150, but Alice's offer of $130 is still above your target. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate a better price. 
* **Counter-offer:** You can counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:**  $125 is only $5 more than your initial counteroffer of $120.
* **Limited rounds:** You are in round 3, and negotiating further might risk reaching the end of the rounds without a deal.
* **Jhon's price is higher:**  Buying from Jhon would cost $150, which is significantly more expensive."
