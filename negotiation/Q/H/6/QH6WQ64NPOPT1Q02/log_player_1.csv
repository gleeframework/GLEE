Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($10,000) might make him feel like he's getting a deal, even if it's higher than he wants to pay.
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Selling to Bob quickly is advantageous even if Alice gets slightly less than John's offer. This avoids potential delays or complications with John. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
