"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for concessions and signals that you value your product highly. 
* **Above Both Valuations:** The initial price is significantly above both your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives you bargaining power and allows you to gradually lower the price if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the product's ""potential"" and ""benefits"" to make it more appealing to Bob, even at this high price point.

By starting high, you gather information about Bob's willingness to pay and set the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that initial price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but closer to  $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and your initial offer. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss for you. It's clear there's a wide gap to bridge, but you have time to negotiate. 

By rejecting this low offer, you signal to Bob that you're serious about getting a fair price for the product. You can now make a counteroffer that moves closer to a mutually agreeable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reject:** The message starts by recognizing Bob's counteroffer while firmly stating it's too low.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":**  This classic negotiation tactic suggests a spirit of compromise, even though the proposed price ($1,400,000) is still significantly closer to your initial offer than Bob's. 
* **Focus on Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value to justify the higher price, hoping to nudge Bob towards a more realistic offer. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price that's highly profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit closer on the price.  While it's true the product is valuable, I can't justify going above $900,000.  That's a very fair offer, considering its value to me. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer slightly to $900,000, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss compared to selling to John.

You have six rounds remaining, and it's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if you can bridge the gap further. You need to demonstrate firmness and signal that you're willing to walk away from the deal if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to make a significant move to show my commitment to closing this deal. However, I need you to meet me closer to the middle. Let's settle this right now - would you consider $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer acknowledges Bob's movement while conveying the need for a more substantial step from his side.
* **Significant Concession, Clear Expectation:** Moving down to $1,250,000 is a significant concession from your previous offer. It signals flexibility on your part but also sets a clear expectation that Bob needs to make a substantial jump to reach an agreement. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""settle this right now"" injects a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to respond seriously to this offer.

This approach aims to strike a balance between firmness and a willingness to compromise. It puts the ball firmly in Bob's court to make a significant move if he wants to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate the movement you've made on the price. However, to be honest, anything above $1,000,000 just doesn't make sense for me. I'm willing to offer you a flat $1,000,000 â€“ take it or leave it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated that $1,000,000 is his ""final offer"" and that anything above that doesn't make sense for him. This strongly suggests he won't go any higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on $200,000 compared to selling to John.  
* **Limited Potential Upside:**  Continuing the negotiation has limited upside.  Bob is unlikely to budge, and even if you extract a small concession, it's improbable to reach a price that surpasses John's offer.

While you've made progress in the negotiation, Bob's firm stance and the guaranteed offer from John make selling to John the most rational and profitable decision at this point."
