"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I'm interested, but $12500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  How about $10000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go quite that low. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10625.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",10625.0,Bob,4,
