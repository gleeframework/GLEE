"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,500 is a good price, it's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay for a product worth no more than $15,000. There's potential to negotiate a lower price, so Bob should reject the offer and try to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I'm interested, but $12,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  How about $10,000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go quite that low. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,250 is closer to his desired price, he can likely still get it lower. He should reject the offer and try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,625.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11000? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, and with only 5 rounds left, Bob needs to be pragmatic.  

* **Risk of Rejection:** Further counteroffers might lead to Alice becoming firm and refusing to negotiate further. 
* **Cost of John:** Buying from John for $15,000 is significantly higher than Alice's current offer.
* **Potential Savings:** While Bob could try to get a slightly lower price, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer at $11,000 is the best option for Bob.  It's within his budget and allows him to secure the product without the risk of a higher price or running out of rounds."
