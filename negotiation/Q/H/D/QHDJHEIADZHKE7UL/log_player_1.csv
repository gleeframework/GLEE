Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in relatively small increments. It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price ($100) quickly enough to warrant continuing the negotiation. I'd rather take the guaranteed $100 from John."
