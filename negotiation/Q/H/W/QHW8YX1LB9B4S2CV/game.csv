"I appreciate your offer, Alice, and I can see the value in this product. However, I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is a good starting point, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price still allows me to realize a significant return on my investment while being a competitive offer for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product.
