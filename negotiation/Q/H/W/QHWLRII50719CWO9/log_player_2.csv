"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($110 < $120).**
* **You save money compared to buying from John ($110 < $120).** 

Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, accepting her offer is the best strategy in this scenario as it ensures you get the product within your budget and saves you money compared to the alternative."
