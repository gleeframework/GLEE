"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  $10,000 is too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and $10000. How about $11250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,250 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm going to counter Bob's offer. It's worth trying to get a bit closer to my ideal price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $11,250 is still a bit lower than I can go.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $11,625. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations."", ""product_price"": 11625}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit above $11625. I'm willing to go up to $11500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is tempting, I'm only one round away from selling to John for $12,000. It's worth trying to see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more in the next round before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $11,750.  This is the best price I can do,  and I hope we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit above $11750. I'm willing to go up to $11750, but I need you to meet me exactly at that price. Can you do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally met my counteroffer, and I'm happy to accept it.  I'm  very close to selling to John, and this deal is only $250 less. It's better to finalize the deal now and avoid the risk of losing both Bob and John."
