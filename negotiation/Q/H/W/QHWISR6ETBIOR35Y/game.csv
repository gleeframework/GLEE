"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and $10000. How about $11250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $11250 is still a bit lower than I can go.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $11625. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",11625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit above $11625. I'm willing to go up to $11500. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $11750.  This is the best price I can do,  and I hope we can close the deal.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit above $11750. I'm willing to go up to $11750, but I need you to meet me exactly at that price. Can you do that?",11750.0,Bob,8,
