Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still room to get a better deal since he can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000."

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and the market price. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to his target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current positions and offer it to you for $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise that I hope you'll consider.

While Alice has come down in price, it's still not a good enough deal for Bob.  He can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
