"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm offering it at a starting price of $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000.  I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,250.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,250 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. He has plenty of rounds left, and there's a good chance Alice will be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $11,625. This price is fair, and I'm confident it will allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming to make this a win-win. While I value the product highly, I'm ready to come down to $11,950. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,950 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $11,625. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's becoming risky. Alice has stated this is her final offer, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price well below John's offer, and it's a good outcome considering the limited rounds remaining."
