Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This is to see if Bob is very interested in the product and willing to pay a premium. It also leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Even though we're getting close to the end, I'm still going to reject.  I'm feeling confident that I can get a higher price in the next round.  The product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm not going to sell it for less."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one. I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but it's getting close to my minimum. However, I've already rejected his offer several times. It's unlikely he'll increase it again, and I only have one round left. It's too risky to keep playing, as there's no guarantee of a better offer. So, I'll take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
