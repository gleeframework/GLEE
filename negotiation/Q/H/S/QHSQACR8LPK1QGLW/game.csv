"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $12000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're open to that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm firm at $8000.  It's my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm at $8000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in this product. Is this a price you're willing to consider?",9000.0,Alice,5,
