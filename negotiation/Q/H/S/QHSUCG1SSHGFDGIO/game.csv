"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping for a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I've already compromised a lot by going down to $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",12500.0,Alice,5,
