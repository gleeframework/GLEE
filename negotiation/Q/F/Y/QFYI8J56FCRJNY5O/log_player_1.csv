"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This allows room for negotiation and leaves me with a comfortable margin for potential concessions. 
* **Initial Leverage:** By setting a high initial price, I establish a strong initial position and signal that the product is valuable. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* My goal is to maximize profit, but I'm also aware of the time limit and the fallback option with John.
* I will carefully analyze Bob's counteroffers (if any) and adjust my subsequent offers accordingly.
* If the negotiations stall or progress too slowly, I'll consider accepting John's offer to ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it signals that he is interested in the product. There's still room for negotiation and a potential for a better price. 

**Strategy:**

* I will use this round to send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* I'm aware that time is ticking, but I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet. 
* If the negotiation doesn't show promise of reaching a fair price, I'll consider selling to John in later rounds."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $200,000 below it.  
* **Potential for Improvement:** The fact that Bob has raised his offer significantly indicates that he's serious about acquiring the product.  I believe there's still a chance to get closer to my desired price range.
* **Limited Time:**  With only two rounds left, I need to be cautious about closing the deal too quickly, as I might miss out on a potentially better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer with a Smaller Concession:** I'll send a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum price, demonstrating a willingness to meet him halfway. This will put pressure on Bob to make a final decision.
* **Assessing the Risk:** If Bob rejects my next offer, I'll seriously consider accepting John's offer, as it's a guaranteed sale.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Concession, Big Impact:**  I'm making a small concession from my previous offer ($1,100,000) to demonstrate flexibility and signal that I'm ready to close the deal. This price is still $150,000 above Bob's last offer, leaving room for negotiation but also putting pressure on him to come closer to my minimum.
* **Closing Time:** With only one round remaining, this counteroffer is my final attempt to maximize profit while still leaving room for a potential counteroffer from Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by offering a slightly lower price, but I believe it's necessary to increase the chances of a deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll accept John's offer to avoid losing any money.
* **Pressure Tactics:** This counteroffer puts pressure on Bob to either accept or make a final counteroffer that meets me closer to my desired price.
* **Maximizing Profit:** While I'm not getting my full asking price, I'm aiming for a reasonably profitable sale in the limited time available.
