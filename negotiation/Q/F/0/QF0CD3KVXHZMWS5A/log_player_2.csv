"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is already quite good, but there's room for negotiation. It's unlikely she'd offer such a significant discount right away if she wasn't willing to go even lower.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? "",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $10,500 is getting closer to a price I'd be happy with. However, I'm aiming to get the price as close to $9,000 as possible. I'll counter with a price a little higher than my initial offer to show I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, which tells me we are getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still aiming for under $10,000.  I'll hold firm on my desired price point for one more round and see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I've been enjoying our back and forth, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget.  I can offer $9,750 for the product. If you can agree to that, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation. I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer to signal that this is my final price. It emphasizes my budget constraints and puts the decision back in Alice's court."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $10,000, which is a significant discount from her original offer and a price I'm comfortable with. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer seems like the best choice now."
