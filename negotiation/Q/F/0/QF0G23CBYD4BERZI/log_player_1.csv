{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to you, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, Bob values it at $1,500,000. This presents an opportunity to sell significantly above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves a comfortable margin for Bob ($200,000 profit) while securing a $300,000 profit for us. This makes it a win-win situation and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is direct, highlights the product's value to Bob, and presents the price confidently as a fair deal."
