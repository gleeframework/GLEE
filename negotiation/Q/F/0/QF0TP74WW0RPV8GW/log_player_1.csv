"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,450,000."",
 ""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high price.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing my bottom line, encouraging Bob to engage. 
* **Alternative:**  I'm keeping the option to sell to John ($1,000,000) in my back pocket if negotiations don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial ask and my minimum acceptable price. His message also suggests room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation Power:** It's still early in the negotiation. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about a higher price and encourages him to move closer to my range.
* **John as Backup:** I'll keep John's offer as a safety net but aim to secure a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product offers is truly significant.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,350,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I've moved down considerably from my initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. This new price point represents a compromise closer to the middle ground between our positions. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value without being overly aggressive. 
* **Maintaining Firmness:** While I'm open to negotiation, this counteroffer still keeps me well above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  Bob's counteroffer shows movement, but it's still a significant gap from my target. His justification about the budget could be a negotiating tactic.
* **Time Consideration:** With six rounds remaining, I have room to negotiate further. Rejecting this keeps the pressure on Bob to increase his offer closer to my range. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob.  I'm willing to leverage the remaining rounds for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I understand budget constraints, but the value this product brings is exceptional.  How about we settle at $1,300,000? This seems like a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making another smaller concession, signaling a willingness to close the deal. 
* **Final Offer Vibe:** By framing this as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm subtly suggesting this is a strong offer and close to my final position. 
* **Time Pressure:** As we approach the halfway point in the negotiation, applying a bit of time pressure can encourage Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,220,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling Tactics:** Bob's incremental increase and emphasis on his ""final offer"" suggest potential negotiation tactics. He's likely willing to go higher.
* **Profit Margin:**  While $1,220,000 is a considerable sum, it's still significantly below my target and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table.
* **Calculated Risk:** With four rounds remaining, I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations.  I'll leverage the time pressure and present a counteroffer closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your position carefully, and to be completely transparent, I can't accept anything below $1,275,000.  This is my final offer. It reflects the true value of the product and is a deal you won't find elsewhere."",
 ""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm drawing a line in the sand, conveying that this is my non-negotiable bottom line. 
* **Transparency and Justification:**  By being transparent and giving a reason (true value), I aim to build trust and discourage further haggling. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Calling it my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency, prompting Bob to make a decision.
* **Alternative Ready:** While I'm hopeful Bob will accept, I'm mentally prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm afraid $1,220,000 is my absolute maximum. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has repeated his ""final offer"" twice now. This suggests he's unlikely to move significantly from his $1,220,000 position.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate at this point carries the risk of losing both Bob and John's offers.  The potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to outweigh the $220,000 difference with John's sure offer.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  John's $1,000,000 offer guarantees a substantial profit and a clean break from what's becoming a protracted negotiation. It's the most rational decision at this stage."
