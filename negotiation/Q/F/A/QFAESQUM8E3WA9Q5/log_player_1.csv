Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a discount:** $100 is lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120, making it more attractive to Bob.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still increase the price if Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **Shows you are willing to negotiate:**  This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting or making a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $85 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 and higher than Bob's initial offer. It's a good compromise and ensures I still make a profit."
