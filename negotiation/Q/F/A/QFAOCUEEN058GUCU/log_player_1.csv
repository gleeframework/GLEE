{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal for you, and I think it's fair for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum of $100. While I could sell to John for that price, I'm hoping to get closer to the $120 value Bob places on the product.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110? This price still gives you a great value and allows me to get closer to what I'm hoping for."", ""product_price"": 110}
