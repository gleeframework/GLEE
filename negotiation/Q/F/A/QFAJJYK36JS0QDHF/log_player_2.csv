Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not willing to budge from my previous counteroffer of $825,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to hold out for this price. What do you think?

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems firm on her price of $825,000 and is unlikely to go lower. While we could continue negotiating, the potential savings are diminishing. Accepting this offer gets us a good deal at $175,000 less than John's price."
