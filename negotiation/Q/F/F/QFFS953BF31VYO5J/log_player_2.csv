```"

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product. While $8000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $10000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is a fair price for the value of the product and still allows me to cover my costs. I'm hoping we can find common ground at this price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with. I'm also starting to consider buying from John at this point, as the negotiation is becoming more time-consuming."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still too high for me.

Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  $12000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13500? This price is fair, considering the value of the product, and hopefully, it works for you too. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

```

My absolute final offer is $11,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price for the product. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to move on to another seller.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
