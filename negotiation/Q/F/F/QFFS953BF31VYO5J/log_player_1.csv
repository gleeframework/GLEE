Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product. While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and hopefully, it's a number that works for you too. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is a significant increase, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $10,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair price for the value of the product and still allows me to cover my costs. I'm hoping we can find common ground at this price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $12000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still a bit below. I believe I can continue negotiating with him and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? This price is fair, considering the value of the product, and hopefully, it works for you too. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to run out of time here, and I need to make a decision soon. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $13500 is still beyond my budget.  My absolute final offer is $11000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price for the product. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to move on to another seller.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time.  I'm not sure I can reach a satisfactory price with Bob in the remaining rounds, and it's better to guarantee a sale for $15,000 with John than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
