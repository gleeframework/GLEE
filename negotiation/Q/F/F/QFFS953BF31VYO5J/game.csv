"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is very valuable, and I think it could be a great asset to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product. While $8000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and hopefully, it's a number that works for you too. Let me know your thoughts.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $10000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is a fair price for the value of the product and still allows me to cover my costs. I'm hoping we can find common ground at this price.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $12000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  $12000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13500? This price is fair, considering the value of the product, and hopefully, it works for you too. Let's close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to run out of time here, and I need to make a decision soon. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $13500 is still beyond my budget.  My absolute final offer is $11000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price for the product. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to move on to another seller.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,8,
