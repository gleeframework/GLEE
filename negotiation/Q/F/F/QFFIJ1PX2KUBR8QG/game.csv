"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1000000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity with incredible potential. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly unique and has a lot of potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $925000?  It's a fair price that recognizes both your budget and the product's value.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $925000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's my final offer. I believe this price is fair considering the product's potential and my budget limitations. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
