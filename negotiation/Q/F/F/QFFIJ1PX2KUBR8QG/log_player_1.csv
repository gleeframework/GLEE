"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity with incredible potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a high price ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Value Emphasis:** My message highlights the product's uniqueness and potential to pique Bob's interest.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's level of interest and give me an idea of his perceived value for the product. 
* **Plan B:** I have the safety net of John's $800,000 offer, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in the initial negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can signal that I'm not willing to settle for a low price and try to push him towards a more acceptable range.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By continuing the negotiation, I have the chance to secure a better price. 
* **Plan B is Secure:** My fallback option with John ensures I'm not in a desperate position.  I can continue to explore a higher price with Bob without feeling pressured."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly unique and has a lot of potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  It's a fair price that recognizes both your budget and the product's value."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a counteroffer to show willingness to compromise. 
* **Middle Ground:** My counteroffer ($925,000) is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher, demonstrating my position and leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* **Value Justification:**  I reiterate the product's uniqueness and potential to justify the price.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not giving in to Bob's low price but offering a compromise to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Plan B:** I still have John's $800,000 offer as a safety net, so I can take a calculated risk with this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $925000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's my final offer. I believe this price is fair considering the product's potential and my budget limitations. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $900,000 is close to my initial target of $1,000,000 and significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Risk of Lower Price:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a high chance he'll walk away or offer a lower price in the next round. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're only four rounds into the negotiation. It's important to avoid wasting valuable time and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob. 
* **Secure Deal:** Accepting this offer guarantees a sale at a profitable price.  

It's a calculated risk, but I believe accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy at this point in the negotiation."
