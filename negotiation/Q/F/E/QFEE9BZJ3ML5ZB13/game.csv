"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $900,000? That's a significant discount, and still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Would you consider $850,000? That's a fair offer.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which is a good compromise.  Let's seal this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems we are getting close on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000 and we have a deal?",875000.0,Bob,6,
