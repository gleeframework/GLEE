"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $130. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go up to $110, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $130. How about $120? This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",120.0,Alice,5,
