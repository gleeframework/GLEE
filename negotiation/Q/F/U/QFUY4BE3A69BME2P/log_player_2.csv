Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to hold onto a bit of profit, and $79 is a reasonable price. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the negotiations going nowhere and ending up with John's $100 price."
