Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price.  $15,000 is my minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. That's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $15,000, which is my maximum budget. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is holding firm at his maximum budget, and I've already lowered my price.  There's no guarantee I can get him to go higher, and I've only got a few rounds left. I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get my minimum price."
