{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I've started with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer with a positive message to encourage Bob's interest. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm letting Bob know I'm open to negotiation by asking for his thoughts.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still being open to a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested, but I can only pay $7500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can potentially get closer to my initial asking price by counter-offering.  Rejecting his offer allows me to explore other options and potentially achieve a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,500 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while presenting a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price point. 
* **Finding a compromise:** I'm emphasizing the need for a compromise, signaling my willingness to negotiate further.
* **Remaining above minimum:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, leaving room for potential further negotiations."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $8500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a sale and a price that's more favorable than selling to John."
