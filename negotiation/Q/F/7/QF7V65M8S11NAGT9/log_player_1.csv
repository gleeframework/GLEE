Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for a compromise with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than my minimum value, I can still potentially get more from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet halfway. How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, $95 is close enough to my desired price point that I'm willing to accept it. It's a better outcome than selling to John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
