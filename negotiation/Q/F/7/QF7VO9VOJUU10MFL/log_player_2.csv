"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is less than John's price of $12,000, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above the product's value to her. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is trying to secure a fair price.  This leaves room for negotiation without risking a complete breakdown of the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's first offer, it's still higher than what you'd like to pay. You can continue negotiating with Alice, as there's still room to find a price that works for both of you. It's also worth noting that you have a backup option with John, so you can always choose to buy from him if the negotiation with Alice doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her previous offer. It shows Bob is serious about purchasing the product and is willing to be flexible.  At $10,000, it's still within Bob's budget, and it's likely to be acceptable to Alice, who is already willing to sell for less than her original asking price."
