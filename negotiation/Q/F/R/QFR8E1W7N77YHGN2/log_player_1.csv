Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation.  If he rejects, we can then see how low he's willing to go.  While I'm confident I can sell it to John for $100, I'd like to maximize my profit if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my minimum value of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still closer to my minimum price than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting too close to my minimum value.  While I would like to get closer to $100, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'll sell to John and guarantee my minimum profit."
