"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a significant gain and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still not quite in the right range for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
