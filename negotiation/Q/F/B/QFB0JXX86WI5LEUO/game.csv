"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its unique benefits.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the response. I appreciate you coming down, but $1,950,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $1,350,000? That seems like a reasonable compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is closer to the mark, I need to stay above $1,700,000 for this deal to make sense.  How about $1,725,000?  This reflects my flexibility while acknowledging the true value of the product.",1725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement. However, $1,725,000 is still a bit rich for me.  I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,537,500. This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",1537500.0,Bob,6,
