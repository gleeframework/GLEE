Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** The offered price of $140 is higher than what Bob values the product at ($100), but lower than what John is willing to pay ($150). This aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a reason to potentially accept the offer. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is framed positively, highlighting a ""great deal"" to entice Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob, avoiding the need to go to John."
