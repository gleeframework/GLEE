"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room to negotiate. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  That would be a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum acceptable value. This shows you're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* **Fair Justification:** The message highlights a fair price for both parties, making the counteroffer more persuasive than just a random number. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends with a positive, open-ended question to keep the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** $900,000 is still above my ideal price.  Alice is showing some flexibility, but there's still potential to negotiate a better deal.
* **Time is on my side:** I still have rounds left to see if I can get closer to my target price. 
* **Avoiding John:** While John's offer is a safety net, I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $875,000. This would give us both a good deal and allow us to move forward. Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  This counteroffer moves slightly closer to Alice's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes the benefit for both parties, framing it as a collaborative solution.
* **Bridging the Gap:** The message explicitly mentions bridging the gap, indicating a willingness to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $890,000. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $890,000 is very close to my target price of $850,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Alice entirely.
* **Avoiding John:** While John's offer is a fallback, it's still significantly higher than what I'm currently being offered.

At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal, and the risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing.  It's a reasonable decision to accept this offer and secure the product."
