"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  That would be a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $875,000. This would give us both a good deal and allow us to move forward. Let's try to bridge the gap.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $890,000. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
