Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget of $8,000. He should counteroffer and see if he can negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. Since this is her final offer, it's unlikely she will budge further.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John at a much lower price."
