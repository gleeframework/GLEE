{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a good price while still leaving room for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, $130 is a reasonable compromise. I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing him entirely.  Selling to John for $150 would be great, but I'm happy with this deal."
