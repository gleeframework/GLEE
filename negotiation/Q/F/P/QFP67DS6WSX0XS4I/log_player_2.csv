{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to you, it's still a good deal. However, there's a strong chance you can get it for even less by counteroffering.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. It's a bold move, but it shows you're serious about getting a good deal and are willing to negotiate aggressively.  You're aiming to split the difference between your maximum price and Alice's initial offer. This should spark further negotiation and hopefully lead to a compromise."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still higher than what you're aiming for. You've already shown Alice you're serious about negotiating, and there's still time to push for a lower price. Rejecting this offer will likely lead to further concessions from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

You're going to meet Alice halfway on her last offer.  This shows you're willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price. The goal is to find a price that both of you can agree on, and this counteroffer is a strong step towards that goal."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is just $25,000 more than your last counteroffer. It's a good deal for you, and you're likely not going to get a significantly lower price. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product while still saving a considerable amount of money. You've successfully negotiated a price much lower than your maximum price."
