"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $16,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000 and the value to you is $10,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $15,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
