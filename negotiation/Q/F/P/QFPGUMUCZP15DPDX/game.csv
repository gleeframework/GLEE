"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider coming down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the value you think the product is worth, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
