"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $5,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $5,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in a negotiation. It leaves room to go up while still being within a reasonable range of your $8,000 maximum.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she completely rejects this offer, it might mean she's aiming for a price closer to her initial offer.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $8,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, $9,000 is still higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $8,000. There's potential for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I can do $6,500.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer moves significantly closer to Alice's price, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $6,500 is a strong offer that:
    * Stays below your $8,000 maximum.
    * Provides room for one more counteroffer below $8,000 if needed.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By now, Alice likely realizes you have other options. This offer encourages her to make a decision quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about $8,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her current offer of $8,500 is still higher than John's offer of $8,000.  At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price that's better than your alternative. It's time to walk away and take the guaranteed deal with John."
