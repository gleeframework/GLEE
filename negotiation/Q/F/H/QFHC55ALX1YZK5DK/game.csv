"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $5,000.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I can do $6,500.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about $8,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
