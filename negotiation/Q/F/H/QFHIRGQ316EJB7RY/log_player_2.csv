"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a clear case of rejecting the offer.  Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It makes sense to counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You have more rounds to negotiate and can still try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm ready to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair offer considering the value I'm placing on it and my budget limitations."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to pay $1100000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is very close to your budget, but you can still try to push for a better deal. If you reject, you might be able to get a better price, especially since John is a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is a fair offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm ready to pay $1,200,000, which is my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to pay $1200000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1225000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is only $25,000 lower than John's price.  You've already had a lot of negotiation rounds and at this point, it's probably more efficient to just buy from John and save the time and hassle of further negotiations."
