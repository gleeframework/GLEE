Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in the product, but I want to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting $87 is a good deal. It exceeds my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
