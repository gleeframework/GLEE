Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's perspective:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so offering it slightly below $12,000 might entice him. 
* **Negotiation room:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing Alice's profit."
