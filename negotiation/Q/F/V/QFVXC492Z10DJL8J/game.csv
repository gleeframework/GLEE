"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $8,000 is too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still leaves you with a fair price for a valuable product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe $8,000 is still a reasonable price for the product considering its value. I would like to stick to this figure. If you're unable to meet this price, I'll consider purchasing the product from another seller.",8000.0,Bob,4,
