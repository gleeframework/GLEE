You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $150.
* Alice is offering the product for $120. 
* This means there's room for negotiation to get a better price.  
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120, but still higher than her worth of $80.
* This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially save a significant amount of money. 
* I'm confident that I can get a better price than $120, but I'm also aware that I can always buy from John for $150 if this negotiation fails."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $130 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer of $120 and higher than my counteroffer of $100.
* This price is within my budget of $150, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $150. 
* Accepting this offer allows me to buy the product while saving some money."
