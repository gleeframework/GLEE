{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can also use John's offer as leverage during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  A $900,000 offer is still within my budget and leaves room for potential compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  I can use John's offer as leverage to push for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but also keeps the price within my budget. It's a compromise that could potentially be accepted, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now within my budget, it's still higher than John's offer. I'm going to try one more time to negotiate a better price with Alice, but if she rejects my next offer, I'll buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay. It's equal to John's offer, so if Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John. I'm hoping that Alice sees the value of closing the deal and accepts my offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than John's offer. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice because I can get the same product for a lower price from John.  It's time to end the negotiation and buy from John."
