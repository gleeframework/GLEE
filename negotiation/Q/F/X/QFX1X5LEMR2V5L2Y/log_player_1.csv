{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $105? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

While $97 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell below $100.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but I want to stay above my minimum."
