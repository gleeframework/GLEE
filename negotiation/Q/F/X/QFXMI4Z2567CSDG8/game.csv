"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately a little low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $12500? It's a good compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. $11000 is getting closer to what I had in mind. Would you be willing to go to $11500?  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both feel good about the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,

I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11250? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget constraints.,11250.0,Bob,6,
