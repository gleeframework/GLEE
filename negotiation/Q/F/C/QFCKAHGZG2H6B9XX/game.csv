"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $10,200? It's still a good price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10200.0,Alice,5,
