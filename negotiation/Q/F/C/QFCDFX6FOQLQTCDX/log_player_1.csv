Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, starting high allows room for negotiation while staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""its potential value"") makes the offer seem less arbitrary and more palatable. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrasing ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the conversation open.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation. If Bob rejects the initial offer, there's still a chance to negotiate downwards, always keeping the $800,000 backup offer from John in mind."
