"Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, but I'm not going to go any higher.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To be fair, I can come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,350,000 is still too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
