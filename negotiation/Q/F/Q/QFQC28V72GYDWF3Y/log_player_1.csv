Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize you see the value in this product, $900,000 undervalues its full potential impact for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I expect to get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly showing interest and a willingness to negotiate.  We'll continue pushing for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with the value I expect to get from the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we are now at $975,000. While we could push for more, the gains are becoming smaller and there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit over John's $800,000 offer."
