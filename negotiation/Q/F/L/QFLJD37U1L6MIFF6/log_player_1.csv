Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at my desired price point, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value. This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, which is crucial for a successful negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** Bob's interest in the product is clear, indicating potential for a better deal. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my target.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  While John's offer provides security, I'm still motivated to see if I can get a better price from Bob. If further negotiations fail, I can always fall back to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $135? This gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but making a counter-proposal. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my profitability.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've suggested a price that's halfway between my original offer and Bob's offer. This strategy often leads to a quicker resolution. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this price still represents a good deal for him, making it more appealing.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to continue the dialogue and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate, where we both refuse to budge, wasting time and potentially losing John's offer. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer provides me with a guaranteed profit, which is preferable to the uncertainty of continuing negotiations with Bob. 

By selling to John, I can secure a good profit and avoid the potential for further losses during a protracted negotiation with Bob."
