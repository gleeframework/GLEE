Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  $900,000 is tempting, but I have to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $880,000?  That's a strong offer, and it allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.

Bob's offer:
