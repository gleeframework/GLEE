"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I believe the product's unique features and benefits justify a higher price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for this exceptional product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique features and benefits, but I still believe $1200000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1600000. Can you consider my revised counteroffer?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product's value is higher than your revised offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1600000, so I'll offer it to you for $1700000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1700000, so I'll offer $1650000. Can you consider my revised counteroffer?",1650000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1700000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for this exceptional product. I'll offer it to you for $1680000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",1680000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as high as $1650000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this offer. I'll consider other options, including buying from John for $800000.",1650000.0,Bob,8,
