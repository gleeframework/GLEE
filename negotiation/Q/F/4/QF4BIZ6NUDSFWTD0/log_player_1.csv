"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm asking for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its potential benefits for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** This is a classic negotiation tactic. It allows for room to compromise and gives the impression that you are confident in the product's value.
* **Fair offer:** While $1,200,000 is significantly more than my minimum, it's still a good deal for Bob considering the product's worth to him. This increases the likelihood of his accepting the offer.
* **Positive language:** The message emphasizes the product's value and avoids aggressive language, fostering a more collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a significant improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still secure a higher price, especially with 8 rounds remaining.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is my safety net, but I'd prefer to get a better price from Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still beneficial for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but still maintain a significant profit margin. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:**  I frame the offer as a win-win scenario, highlighting the value for both parties.
* **Focus on closing the deal:**  The message encourages a swift resolution by emphasizing the benefits of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's getting closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still below my target price. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** With 6 rounds remaining, there's still room to bargain and potentially secure a better price.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** I'd prefer to exhaust all negotiation options before resorting to selling to John at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the costs and potential of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise that allows us to both achieve our goals. Let's close this deal with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm not giving in entirely. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Emphasizing mutual gain:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario, emphasizing how it meets both of our needs.
* **Urgency and finality:**  The message includes phrases like ""let's close this deal"" and ""final offer"" to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still not meeting my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We are halfway through the negotiation process, and there are only 4 rounds left.  I need to be strategic to maximize my potential profit.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still a chance to negotiate a higher price, especially given Bob's willingness to increase his offer.  Selling to John is a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $925,000 simply doesn't cover the value and potential of this product for your business.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the mutual benefits we'll both gain from this deal.  Let's finalize this agreement and move forward."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer again, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing mutual benefits:** I'm framing the offer as mutually advantageous, emphasizing the potential gains for both parties.
* **Urgency and closure:**  I'm using phrases like ""bridge the gap"" and ""finalize this agreement"" to encourage a quick resolution and avoid further rounds. 
* **Staying above minimum:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $975,000, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** With only 2 rounds remaining, the negotiation window is closing. 
* **No Significant Progress:** Bob's offer hasn't increased considerably from previous rounds, and it's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Securing a Guaranteed Sale:**  While I'd prefer to earn more, selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing in the final round.

Given these factors, it's more strategically sound to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed sale rather than risking a stalemate with Bob."
