You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a good price, there's potential to negotiate further and get an even better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($900,000) gives you a good starting point for negotiation.  $700,000 is a substantial discount, making it more likely Alice will consider it while still leaving room for potential further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $900,000 and is much lower than John's offer of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves you a substantial amount of money and fulfills your goal of buying the product at the best possible price."
