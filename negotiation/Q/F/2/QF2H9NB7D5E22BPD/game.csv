"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $8,750?  I'm confident this price is fair and reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,625?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",8625.0,Bob,4,
