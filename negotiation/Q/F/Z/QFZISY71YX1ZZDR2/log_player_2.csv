"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range considering my maximum budget of $15,000. This should give Alice an incentive to negotiate, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, which gives me ample opportunity to find a suitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, lowering her price. I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $14,000, which is still within my budget and hopefully closer to a point where Alice might be willing to accept.  We are getting closer to a deal with more rounds to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $15,000, but it's getting closer. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating, hoping to push the price down further.  We only have 5 rounds left, so we need to make progress. I'll try to find a compromise that works for both of us in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's last offer was very close to my budget, so I'm going to make a final push with my maximum offer. I'm hoping she'll accept, as we only have four rounds remaining. If she doesn't, I'll have to weigh the risk of buying from John and potentially losing a better deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  We only have three rounds left.  While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I've already made my maximum offer of $15,000 and Alice rejected it.  I'm not confident that we'll reach a deal in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk running out of time.  Buying from John for $15,000 guarantees I get the product and stay within my budget."
