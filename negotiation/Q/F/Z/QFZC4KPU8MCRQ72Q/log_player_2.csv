"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $120
* **Your Value:** $150
* **John's Price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $30 compared to buying from John. Even though you could get it for $100 from Alice, this is not possible in this scenario as you are constrained to the given choices."
