"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a great deal on this valuable product. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
