"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $900,000 for this product. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go lower than $890,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a profit while still offering you a good deal. What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $880,000 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $885,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",885000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced it's the best price. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option for me.",875000.0,Bob,8,
