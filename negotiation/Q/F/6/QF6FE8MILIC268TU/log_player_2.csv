"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  He should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is your budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above his budget, and while it's closer to his ideal price, he's only in round 3, meaning he has plenty of rounds left to potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice. However, he also has a guaranteed deal with John, so it's not worth risking a failed negotiation with Alice."
