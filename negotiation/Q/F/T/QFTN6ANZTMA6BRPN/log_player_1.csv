Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $950,000 before considering other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still lower than your guaranteed offer from John.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** The message hints at other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency and making the offer seem more exclusive. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
