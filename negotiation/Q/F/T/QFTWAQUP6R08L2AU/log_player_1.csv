{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum price, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects it, I can lower the price slightly. If he accepts, I'll make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $8,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that price, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to make more, it's not worth risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower offer or a stalemate.  Accepting his offer ensures I sell the product and receive my minimum desired amount."
