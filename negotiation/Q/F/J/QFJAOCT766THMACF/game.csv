"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This represents a good value for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $950,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers.
