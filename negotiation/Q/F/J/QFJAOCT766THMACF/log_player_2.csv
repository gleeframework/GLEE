"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,000,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He has 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so there's no need to rush into an acceptance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This represents a good value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $950,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Alice's offer of $950,000 is a slight improvement, but Bob can likely do better with another counteroffer. He still has multiple rounds left and a backup option with John, so he can afford to be patient and push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting close to Bob's target:**  $920,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 and is only $20,000 away from Bob's last counteroffer of $900,000.
* **Saving time and potential risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Alice withdrawing her offer.  It's better to secure the product at a price that is within Bob's budget.
* **Backup option:**  Even though Bob could buy from John for $1,200,000, it's still a significant saving to purchase from Alice at $920,000.

While a slightly lower price might be ideal, accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price while minimizing potential risks and further negotiations."
