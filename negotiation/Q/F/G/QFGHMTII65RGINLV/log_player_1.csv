Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me too.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  I can still get a better deal than $9,500."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still a good deal for me. I'm happy to close the deal now rather than risk him backing out or continuing to negotiate."
