"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a lower price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation to potentially save more money.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $850,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $950,000. This offer is still higher than Alice's value of $800,000, so there's potential for a deal. It allows for a substantial saving compared to John's price while leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to her initial offer of $950,000, showing she's not willing to budge much.  While still less than John's price, Bob can likely do better. There's still room to negotiate and see if Alice will meet Bob closer to his counteroffer of $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise. It's higher than his previous offer of $850,000, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway. However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer of $975,000. This offer is more likely to be accepted by Alice, as it provides a reasonable profit margin for her while still being a good deal for Bob compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is very close to her initial offer of $950,000.  She's not showing a strong willingness to move toward Bob's desired price. At this point, the negotiation is likely to continue in a similar fashion.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John. While it's not the absolute best price, it's a guaranteed purchase at a known price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks getting stuck in a lengthy process with no guarantee of a better outcome."
