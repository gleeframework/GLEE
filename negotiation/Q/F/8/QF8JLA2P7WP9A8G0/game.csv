"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire something truly special. Consider it carefully, as I have another buyer lined up who is also eager to purchase it.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
