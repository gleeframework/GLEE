"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $1,000,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,050,000? This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply isn't enough for me. However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? This price is right at the edge of my acceptable range, and it would allow us to complete this transaction. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
