"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still beyond my comfortable range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $950,000.  This price is still significantly lower than your original offer, but it's a fair compromise that allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'll meet you at $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $960,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This is truly my final offer, as I'm approaching my budget limit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go below $980,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'll counter with $970,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",970000.0,Alice,7,
