{

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob appears to be incrementally increasing his offer while we are decreasing ours.  Accepting at $1,125,000 secures a significant profit over our alternative sale price of $800,000.  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us having to settle for even less as we approach the 10-round limit."
