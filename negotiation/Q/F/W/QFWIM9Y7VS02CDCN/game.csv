"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $15000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $18000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $18000. However, I'm willing to throw in a few extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's normally worth $1000. So, the total value you'll get is $19000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $17500.",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17500 and $16500. I'll sell it to you for $17000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal.",17000.0,Alice,7,
