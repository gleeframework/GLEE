"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,800 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,900?",9900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,900 is still too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,200? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. Can you meet me there?",10000.0,Bob,6,
