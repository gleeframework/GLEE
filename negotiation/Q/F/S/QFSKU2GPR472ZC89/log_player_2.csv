It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated Alice down to $950,000, a saving of $50,000 compared to John's price.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains.  Alice is unlikely to drop significantly below this point.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Being too aggressive could push Alice away, leading you to settle for John's $1,000,000 offer."
