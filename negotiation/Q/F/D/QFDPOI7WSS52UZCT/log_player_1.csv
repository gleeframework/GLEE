I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,500 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with a counteroffer."

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still too low.  While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially getting a worse offer. I'm going to sell to John for $8,000 and be done with it."
