Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as high as $10,750. I can offer you a compromise at $11,250. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is very unlikely to go much lower than $11,250. Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate, and buying from John means overpaying significantly. Accepting the $11,250 offer secures a reasonable deal."
