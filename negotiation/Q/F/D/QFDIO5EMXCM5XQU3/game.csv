"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still very interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9800 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $9800. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $9800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9800.0,Bob,8,
