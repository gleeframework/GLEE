"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product would be beneficial, but that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but it's important to start with a strong position. This allows room for negotiation while still remaining significantly below my $800,000 maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that initial offer reflects the true value of this product, I want to find a solution that works for us both. Could we consider $975,000?  I believe this price point still reflects the significant value it would bring to your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but it's still too high. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That's closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to split the difference between our current positions, but leans more toward my desired price point. It shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground - would you be willing to finalize the deal at $850,000?  This reflects a significant discount on my initial offer while acknowledging the value this product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting very close to my limit, but I'm still willing to see if I can save an extra $50,000 by going one more round. It's a risk, but potentially worth the savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and we're very close.  I'd be willing to close the deal today at $800,000."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

This is my final offer, matching my maximum budget. It's a strong offer, and Alice is likely to accept knowing I have another option at the same price."
