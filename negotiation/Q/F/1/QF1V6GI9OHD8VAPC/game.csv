"I appreciate your time, and I'm interested in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm afraid $12000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $14000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $14000 is still not my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $16500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made concessions, but I'm still not willing to go above $14000. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I need you to understand that this is my final offer. If I don't get a good deal here, I'll have to consider buying from John.",14000.0,Bob,6,
