Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a price that I think is fair, considering the product is worth at least $80 to me.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get more than $80, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to sell to Bob at his price than to risk losing both Bob and John."
