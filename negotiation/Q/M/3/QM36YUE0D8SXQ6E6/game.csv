"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $14,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth it.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I think $15,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,500 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm firm on my price of $15,000. This is a fair price for a product of this value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",15000.0,Alice,5,
