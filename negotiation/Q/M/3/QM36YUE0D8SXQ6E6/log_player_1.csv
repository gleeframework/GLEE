"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, but it's good to know he's interested. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $14,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth it."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I think $15,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not going to sell for less than $15,000, which is what John is offering. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,500 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm firm on my price of $15,000. This is a fair price for a product of this value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I get a price that meets my minimum requirement, and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
