Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

This initial offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000 but recognizing Bob's value is $1,000,000.  I'll need to gauge his response to see if I can push further or if I need to be more flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop to a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a higher offer, but I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John if we can't reach a reasonable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,125,000? This price still leaves room for a good profit for you, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to buy the product without exceeding my budget, and it's closer to my target price. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I'm willing to continue negotiating but need to push for a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still potential for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, but $1,075,000 is still below my bottom line.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking to close this deal, and I am too. However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,085,000. This is a good compromise, and we can finally reach an agreement. It would be a good price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer.  While he's showing more flexibility, $1,085,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer but keep the option of selling to John open.  The risk is that Bob may walk away, but I'm willing to take that chance if it means getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,092,500. This is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 1092500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,092,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,087,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us to reach an agreement. It's also a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not satisfactory.  With only three rounds left, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob is high. Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price, it's strategically wiser to sell to John and secure a guaranteed high profit."
