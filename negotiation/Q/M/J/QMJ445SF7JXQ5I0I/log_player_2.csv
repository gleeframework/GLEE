# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $120 by you. I'm proposing to sell it to you for $100. This is an excellent opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Please let me know if you're interested in purchasing it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $100, while John is selling it for $120. 
* **You are willing to pay up to $120:** This means you'll save money by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **Alice's offer is above her value:** Even though Alice values the product at $80, she's willing to sell it for $100. This indicates a good deal for you."
