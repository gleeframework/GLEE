Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on your investment while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what you believe the product is worth.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired range."

Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet $900,000. I am willing to pay up to $875,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies our respective needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is close to your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While you might prefer a higher price, accepting this offer avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially result in a lower price or even losing the deal altogether.  It's important to consider the potential time and effort involved in additional negotiations and the certainty of securing a sale at this price."
