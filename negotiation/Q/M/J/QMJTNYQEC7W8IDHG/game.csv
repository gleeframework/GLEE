"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on your investment while staying within my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget limitations. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting a fair compromise.  This price still leaves significant value for you while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
