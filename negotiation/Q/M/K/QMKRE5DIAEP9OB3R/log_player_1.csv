{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'm selling and I think you'd be very interested. I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering the product at a price higher than my minimum value but still potentially attractive to Bob. It leaves room for bargaining and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
