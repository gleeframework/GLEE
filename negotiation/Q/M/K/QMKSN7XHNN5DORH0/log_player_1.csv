Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so $100 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You won't lose money on this deal, as your minimum is $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still make counteroffers and potentially get closer to your ideal price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  You're not desperate to sell to Bob, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $120. Therefore, rejecting his offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still staying above your minimum.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes a good deal for both parties.
* **Strategic price point:** $92.50 is a realistic compromise that leaves room for further negotiation. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $87.50 is still too low. It's much closer to his perceived value ($80) than yours ($120).  While it might seem tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of going lower and lower outweighs the potential gain. 

Selling to John for $120 guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower price.  It's better to secure a known value than to gamble on a potential deal with an uncertain outcome."
