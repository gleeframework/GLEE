Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

Since I value the product at $1,500,000 and John is willing to pay that amount, I will offer Bob the product at that price. This is because:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000.**
* **Bob's valuation is $800,000, so he is unlikely to accept this offer.**
* **If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for my minimum price.**

This strategy guarantees me the best possible outcome."
