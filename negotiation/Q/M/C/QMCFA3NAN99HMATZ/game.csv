"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that I think we can both live with. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to reach a certain price, but $950,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful that we can find common ground here.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. I'm not willing to go any lower, so this is my final offer. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,
