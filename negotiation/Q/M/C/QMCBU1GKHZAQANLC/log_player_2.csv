"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by significantly reducing the price to $10,000. It's a bold move, but since Bob's maximum value is $12,000, this leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing the price slightly from the previous offer, but still staying below Bob's maximum value of $12,000. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on the price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum value of $12,000. There's still a chance to negotiate a better price, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to compromise in previous rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is Bob's final offer, his maximum value for the product. He's shown willingness to negotiate, but he's firm on his price. It's a risky move, but it forces Alice to decide if she's willing to accept his offer or risk losing the deal."
