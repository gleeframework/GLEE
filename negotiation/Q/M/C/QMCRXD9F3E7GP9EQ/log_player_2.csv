"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth attempting to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. It's close to your maximum budget, but it's also a realistic starting point for haggling.  If Alice rejects this offer, you can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is within your budget and a significant improvement from her previous offer. It's only $500 more than your desired price and potentially worth the extra cost to avoid further negotiation. It's also a better deal than buying from John, who is offering the product for $8,000."
