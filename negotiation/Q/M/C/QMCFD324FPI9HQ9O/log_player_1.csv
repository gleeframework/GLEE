Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to split between you and Bob.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob would rather walk away.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we start the conversation at $1,150,000?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting at $1,150,000 anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, making him feel more involved in the process. It also gives you space to potentially come down a bit while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Confidence and Mutual Benefit:** The language emphasizes a win-win scenario, encouraging Bob to engage.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to assess his response and adjust your strategy accordingly."
