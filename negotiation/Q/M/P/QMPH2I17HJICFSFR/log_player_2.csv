"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:**  This offer is a compromise. It's closer to Alice's valuation, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $9,500 is the middle ground between Alice's initial offer of $11,000 and Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Strong Signal:** By presenting a counter-offer, Bob shows his interest in buying the product but also his willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm going to counter with $10,250. That's still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get out of this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice's offer is lower than her original offer, it's still above what the product is worth to her. This means there's still room for negotiation and Bob can potentially secure a better deal.
* **Close to his limit:**  $10,250 is quite close to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  He wants to save as much money as possible and rejecting allows him to try to get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we try $9,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground Again:** This offer is a compromise between Bob's previous offer of $9,500 and Alice's latest offer of $10,250.
* **Slight Increase:** It's a small increase from Bob's previous offer, showing that he's willing to negotiate but not go too far.
* **Closing the Deal:**  This counter-offer signals a willingness to reach an agreement while still keeping a price that is reasonable for Bob."
