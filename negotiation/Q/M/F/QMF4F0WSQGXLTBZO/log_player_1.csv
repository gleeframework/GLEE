I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards and still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a decent profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob my minimum price of $10,000.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $8,000.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if he doesn't."
