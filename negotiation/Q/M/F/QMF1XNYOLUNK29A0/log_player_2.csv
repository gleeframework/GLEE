Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand we're still a bit apart.  $950,000 isn't quite enough for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,100,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us - you'd get a great deal on the product, and I'd be able to move forward with this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,025,000. It's a good step in the right direction. To make this work for me, I need to be at $1,150,000. This would be a fair compromise, as it's  closer to your last offer and still allows me to get a reasonable price for the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is consistently overvaluing the product for her benefit. We're only getting closer to our absolute limit, and there's no guarantee she'll go any lower. John's offer is a sure thing and saves us a potential $150,000."
