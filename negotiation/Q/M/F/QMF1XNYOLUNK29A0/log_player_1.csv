``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Justifying the price:** I'm trying to make Bob feel like the price is fair by highlighting its value to him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could accept his offer and earn something, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for a better price.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
