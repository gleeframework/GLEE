Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already established a minimum price of $1,200,000 with John, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think $1,200,000 is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for that amount.

Alice has revealed that her minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000. This matches your final offer and saves you the most money compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a better price."
