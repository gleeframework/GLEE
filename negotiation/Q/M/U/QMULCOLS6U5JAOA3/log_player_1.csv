Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the value to you (Alice), the message hints at the product's worth by mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat-out rejects it, you haven't lost anything, as you have John as a backup. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be very price-sensitive, you might want to start with a slightly lower offer. 
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate! If Bob counters, be ready with counter-offers to reach a mutually beneficial price."
