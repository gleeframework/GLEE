Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. We want to get as close to that number as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly lower than his perceived value allows for potential counter-offers and a sense of getting a deal.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have John as a safety net at $1,000,000, ensuring we never sell below our minimum.

**The Message:**

*  The message is polite and emphasizes the product's value to Bob.
*  It presents the offer as a starting point for discussion rather than an ultimatum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
