"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm confident that if Bob rejects this offer, he'll counter with a lower price, and we can work towards a mutually acceptable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'm not going to sell it to John just yet. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $155.  This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $145 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to accept his offer. While I would prefer a higher price, I'm aware that we've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
