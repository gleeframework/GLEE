{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the potential benefit for him. If he rejects, I can always go back to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. Considering the value of the product to you and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can counter-offer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000. I understand your budget, but this product is worth significantly more than $950,000 to me. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I understand the value you place on the product, I believe we can still negotiate further. I would like to propose a price of $960,000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise given the value it holds for me and the price range we've discussed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price of $975,000. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, I don't want to risk losing this deal completely. I believe $960,000 is a good compromise that secures a decent profit for me."
