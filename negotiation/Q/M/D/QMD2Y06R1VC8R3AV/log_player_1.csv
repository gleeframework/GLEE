Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $11,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand that my initial price might seem a little high, but the value this product brings is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a little on the price, but $17,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $12,000, but that's really the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be honest,  $12,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. Let's make this our final offer: $15,500. This is a very fair price for a product of this caliber.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for explaining your position. I understand it's a good product, but I have a strict budget. My absolute final offer is $12,500. If you can't do that, I'll have to go with a different option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is very unlikely to move significantly from his $12,500 offer.  It's clear that the difference between what I'm willing to accept and what he's willing to pay is too large to overcome in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
