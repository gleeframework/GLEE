"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $11,000 for it.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand that my initial price might seem a little high, but the value this product brings is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a little on the price, but $17,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $12,000, but that's really the most I can do.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be honest,  $12,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. Let's make this our final offer: $15,500. This is a very fair price for a product of this caliber.  What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for explaining your position. I understand it's a good product, but I have a strict budget. My absolute final offer is $12,500. If you can't do that, I'll have to go with a different option.",12500.0,Bob,6,
