Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is still a good deal for Bob as it is less than his $15,000 maximum willingness to pay.
* **Lower than your minimum acceptable value:** This ensures you make a profit while still maximizing your chances of a deal with Bob.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob balks at the price, you can still negotiate down a bit without falling below your minimum."
