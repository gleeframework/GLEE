"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than $12,000, you can likely get a better price. You are willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice values the product at $8,000. There's room for negotiation, making it worthwhile to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price, while still offering a profit for her. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal for you. It's significantly lower than John's offer and still leaves Alice with a profit. There's a chance that you could negotiate a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and you ending up buying from John at $12,000 is too high."
