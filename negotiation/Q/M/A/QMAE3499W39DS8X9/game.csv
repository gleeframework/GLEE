"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet, Bob. I can do $10,750, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think you'll really love the product, and it's worth every penny.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $11,250. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",11250.0,Alice,7,
