"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the first offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best price possible. He's starting by offering $12,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer signals that Bob is serious about buying but is willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  This move puts the pressure on Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try for a lower price. There are still rounds left, and a better deal may be possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $12,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of getting the lowest price possible. He's offering a price that's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's offer. This shows that he's willing to meet halfway, but also that he's not willing to pay more than $12,500."
