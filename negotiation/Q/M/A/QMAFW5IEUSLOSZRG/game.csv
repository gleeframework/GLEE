"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $12,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
