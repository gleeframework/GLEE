Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to start negotiations significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as related to the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth even more than $2,000,000 to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and ends with a question, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation process. 

While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright, the potential for a much higher sale price makes this a calculated risk worth taking. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can always negotiate down, knowing I have a fallback option with John."
