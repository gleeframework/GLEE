"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1600000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
