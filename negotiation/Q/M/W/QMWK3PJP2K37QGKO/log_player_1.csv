"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer and gauge his potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is close to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I want to see if he's truly interested in the product at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still believe the product is worth more.  We'll see if he's willing to budge closer to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still do better.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him a little further.  The product is worth more than $14,200 to me, and I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14400}
```

I'm offering $14,400. This is a small compromise, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and hopefully will entice Bob to accept. We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm confident I can get a price that's more than the $10,000 I'd get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $100 away from my last counteroffer. I've been pushing him to the limit, and it's getting close to my minimum value.  It's better to accept his offer now and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  If I reject, I risk him walking away entirely, leaving me with only the $10,000 offer from John."
