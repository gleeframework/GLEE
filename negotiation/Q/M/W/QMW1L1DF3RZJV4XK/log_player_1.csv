"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value for the product is $120. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering $130, which is still a reasonable compromise considering my minimum value and Bob's initial counteroffer. I hope this will be a starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm going to offer $125.  This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer and is only $5 above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk getting a lower offer. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with an even lower offer."
