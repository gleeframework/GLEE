"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1400000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and allows me to earn a significant profit.  Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice is offering a ""deal,"" it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, saving $200,000."
