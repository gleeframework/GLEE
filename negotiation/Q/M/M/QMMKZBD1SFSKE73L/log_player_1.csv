"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I cannot accept it.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $13,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair price and accepts."
