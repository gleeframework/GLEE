"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence about the product's value can influence Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room:** This initial offer leaves ample space for Bob to counter, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I would be willing to consider purchasing it for $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. It's clear we have a wide gap to bridge. While I could accept John's offer right now, I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more, as there's still potential to get a better deal than $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and what I'm willing to accept.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation."",
""product_price"": 1900000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** It's important to acknowledge Bob's offer, even though it's far off. This shows I'm taking his response seriously.
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm standing my ground on the value while making a significant price reduction to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is still comfortably above my minimum and allows room for further negotiation. It also aims to move Bob closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to work within my budget. Would you consider $800,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his maximum perceived value ($800,000) and called it his ""final offer."" While it's closer to a reasonable range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll use my next counteroffer to try and nudge him a bit higher, but I'll also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget constraints. I've tried to be flexible, but I can't sell this product for less than $1,600,000.  This is my final offer â€“ I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value you'll gain. Let me know if you're willing to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear this is my last price. This adds weight to the negotiation and signals that I'm serious about my bottom line.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the value proposition while also emphasizing this is a significant discount from my original offer.
* **Strategic Price Point:** $1,600,000 is still comfortably above my absolute minimum and gives Bob a chance to accept a price that works for both of us. However, I'm prepared to walk away and take John's offer if Bob doesn't budge."
