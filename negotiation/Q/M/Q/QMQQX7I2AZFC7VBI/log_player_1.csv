Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for potential bargaining. It's a strong starting point, but I'm open to negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to his offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still value the product higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum.  Even though I'm open to negotiation,  selling to John at $12,000 is a safer option than risking further negotiation with Bob."
