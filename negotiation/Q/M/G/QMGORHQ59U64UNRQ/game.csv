"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $22,000.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to negotiate on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate you seeing the value in this product.  While I'm eager to find a fair price, $10,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $18,000 is still above my budget. Could we consider a price closer to $12,000? I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but  $12,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  To be honest, I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price.  However, I believe you'd get great use out of this product. How about we make this our final offer: $16,000.  This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand you have other potential buyers, but $16,000 is still pushing my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",14000.0,Bob,6,
