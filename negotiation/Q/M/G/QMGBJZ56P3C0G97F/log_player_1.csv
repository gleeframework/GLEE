"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""incredible potential and value"" to justify the high initial price, even though I haven't explicitly stated what the product is.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While I want the best price, I'm aware I have John as a backup who will meet my minimum. This knowledge gives me confidence in negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I started high hoping for more, there's no guarantee I can negotiate him up further. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing him entirely in further rounds."
