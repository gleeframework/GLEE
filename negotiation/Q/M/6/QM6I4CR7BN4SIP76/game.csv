"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is above my budget. Given the value of $800,000 to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value our potential partnership,  $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $875,000, acknowledging the value you place on the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on your price, but $875,000 is still slightly above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and the potential of our partnership.  I believe this offer is fair and would allow us to close the deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
