# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident it can really make a difference. Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the product is worth $15,000 to her, I'll start by offering half of that amount, and then add a bit more to see if I can get a good deal.

{""message"": ""I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, but I think we can do better than that. Can you meet me in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet halfway between our two previous offers at $16,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject Alice's offer again, as $16,250 is still too high for me. I'll try to make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to the price I'm willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get closer to the $8,000 price point.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $16,250 is a fair price. I've done some research, and I'm willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
