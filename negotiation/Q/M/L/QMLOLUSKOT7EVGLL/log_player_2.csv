"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think you'll find it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget.  There's no benefit to accepting her offer as you can get the product from John for the same price. By rejecting, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or potentially find another seller with a better deal."
