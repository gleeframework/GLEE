"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a lower price.  $100 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is a significant saving.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away.  $110 is a good compromise. 
* **Alternative:** John's price is $150, making Alice's offer the better deal."
