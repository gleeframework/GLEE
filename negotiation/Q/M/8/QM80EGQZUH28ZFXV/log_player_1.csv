"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's designed to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. 

I'm also keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round. I still have 9 rounds left and can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is still a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob while still securing a profit.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I would prefer to sell for more, accepting his offer ensures I get my desired profit. I also have 6 rounds left and could potentially continue negotiating, but there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees the sale and avoids any further risk."
