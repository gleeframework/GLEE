"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still above John's price, but significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and is within Bob's budget. It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is lower, it's still above Bob's desired price range.  There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject this offer and try to get a lower price.  It's not worth the risk of accepting this price since he can buy the product from John for a guaranteed lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is still well within his budget and could be seen as a compromise price. This leaves some room for Alice to potentially counteroffer, but also gives Bob a good chance of securing the product at a price he's comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still above John's price, it's getting closer to Bob's desired price range.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks the possibility of Alice refusing to negotiate further and leaving Bob with no option but to buy from John.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that's within his budget and not much higher than John's price."
