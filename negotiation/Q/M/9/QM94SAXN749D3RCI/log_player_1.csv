Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be highly valuable for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for Bob to see the value above $80 (""highly valuable for you"") might make him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $120, you leave space to potentially come down in price while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150. This knowledge gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob."
