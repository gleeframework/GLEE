"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your desired price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, I have John as a backup option, ensuring I won't be pressured into accepting a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I started high, and he countered with a reasonable jump down. It's unlikely he'll walk away easily, especially since he explicitly expressed interest. By rejecting and countering, I can try to secure a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a bit below what I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Showing a willingness to negotiate by significantly lowering the initial price can encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Midpoint:** Aiming for the midpoint between his offer and my initial ask keeps the negotiation moving while still pushing for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm emphasizing that I'm making a compromise, reinforcing the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has now twice met me halfway, indicating a strong desire for the product. 
* **Profitable Deal:** $13,000 is a solid profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal."
