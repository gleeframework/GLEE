"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great value and I think you'll get a lot of use out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to immediately accept.  Since you don't know Alice's minimum selling price, there's a possibility of getting a lower price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! While I see the value in this product, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to purchase it for $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, and I appreciate your honesty. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved from her initial $12,000 to $11,000. This is a good compromise, saving you $1,000.  While there's always a chance of getting a lower price, the risk of further negotiation could lead to Alice backing out or you being forced to buy from John at $12,000.  Accepting at $11,000 secures a good deal within your budget."
