Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. However, I'm not going too high to discourage him from negotiating. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John, so I don't need to accept a very low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, so I need to reject it.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell for less than $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price from $175 to $160, showing flexibility.  This price is still above my minimum threshold but demonstrates a willingness to compromise.  It also leaves room for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $150.  I will reject this offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price.  If Bob rejects my next offer, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $140, moving closer to Bob's last offer. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement, but it's still above my minimum value.  I'm confident that this offer is fair and leaves room for potential further negotiation, if needed."
