"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm really hoping to get it closer to $10,500.  That would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal closer to $10,500. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this works for you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
