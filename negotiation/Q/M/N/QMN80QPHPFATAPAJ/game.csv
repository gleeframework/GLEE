"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, but I need to make a fair profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $900,000.  How about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can do $925,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",925000.0,Alice,5,
