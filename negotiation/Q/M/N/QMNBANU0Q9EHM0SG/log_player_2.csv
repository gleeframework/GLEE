"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This is a good starting point. $950,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget, so it's wise to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"

Round 3

# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can see the value of the product is high, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $825,000, which is closer to my budget and a good compromise. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to make a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $810000. I'll offer it to you for $830000. Let's see if we can seal the deal.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close to my limit. I'm willing to pay $805,000 for the product. This is a fair offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 805000}
```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really close to your limit, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'll make one last concession. I'll offer it to you for $820000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You're only $20,000 away from your limit, and with only one round left, it's not likely you'll be able to get Alice any lower.  It's time to secure the product and save yourself the potential headache of another round of negotiation. John's offer guarantees you the product within your budget."
