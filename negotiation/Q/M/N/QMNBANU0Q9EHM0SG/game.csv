,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $950000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can see the value of the product is high, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $875000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $825000, which is closer to my budget and a good compromise. Let's make this deal happen!",825000.0,Bob,4,
