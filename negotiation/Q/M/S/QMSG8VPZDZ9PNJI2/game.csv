"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500,  which is still a good deal for you. What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
