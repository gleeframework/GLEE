"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider it?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure I can sell it to you for $10500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $11500 for it. Can you think about it?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider it?",10000.0,Bob,6,
