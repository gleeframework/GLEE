"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110?  This is a great product and I think it's worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $105 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $108? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",108.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $107 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given our previous discussions.",107.0,Bob,6,
