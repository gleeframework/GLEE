Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000,  we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if we present it as a time-sensitive opportunity. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $12,000, we leave space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can then potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows us to be a bit bolder in our initial offer to Bob."
