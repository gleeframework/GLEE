"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John as a backup if the negotiation fails."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good deal on this product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a price closer to my target. There's always the option of buying from John, but I want to explore all possibilities before committing to that."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm getting closer to meeting you in the middle, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still over my budget. While I could continue negotiating, it's getting close to my maximum. I've already rejected a few offers, and the likelihood of Alice coming down to my desired price is uncertain.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, it's the most prudent decision to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
