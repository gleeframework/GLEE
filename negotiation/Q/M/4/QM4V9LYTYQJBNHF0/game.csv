"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which still gives you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this, but I can only go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to compromise at $92.50, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's settle this and make a deal!",92.5,Alice,5,
