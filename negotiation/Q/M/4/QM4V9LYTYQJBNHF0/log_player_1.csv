Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above Bob's value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Is below your minimum:** This ensures you won't lose money.
* **Leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob doesn't accept, you can adjust your price based on his counteroffer. 

It's also important to consider:

* **Bob's financial situation:**  If you know Bob is on a tight budget, you might start with a lower offer.
* **Your negotiation skills:** If you're good at negotiating, you might start with a higher offer and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $120.  It also doesn't leave much room for negotiation in the future. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum, it's worth holding out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which still gives you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer:

* **Moves closer to Bob's offer:**  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for further discussion.
* **Keeps the price above my minimum:**  I'm still getting a good price for the product.
* **Uses a friendly tone:**  This helps maintain a positive relationship with Bob in case we continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this, but I can only go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a significant loss for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe I can potentially get a better offer from Bob.  Additionally, selling to John guarantees me my minimum, so I have the luxury of being patient and seeing if Bob will increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to compromise at $92.50, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's settle this and make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** By offering a price slightly lower than my previous offer, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $92.50 is still above my minimum, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Meet in the middle:**  This offer is halfway between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **Use a positive tone:**  I want to encourage Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
