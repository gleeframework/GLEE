{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I value at least $12,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.  

I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers aren't reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? This would be a fair price considering my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer reflects my willingness to negotiate, showing Bob that I'm flexible. $9,500 is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum. It's also a compromise from my initial offer and provides space for further discussion. I'm hoping this offer encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly closer to my minimum price of $12,000 and still gives me a decent profit. While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000,  further negotiation might take too long and I risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a good return on the product."
