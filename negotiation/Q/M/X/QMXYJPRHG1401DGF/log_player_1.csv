Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to make Bob feel like he's getting a good value.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer, knowing I can still achieve my goal of $1,200,000 by selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  There's a chance he might be willing to go up a bit.
* **John is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale to John at my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is fair for both of us. It's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a competitive price. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the ""valuable product"" and ""competitive price"" to remind Bob of the product's worth.
* **""Meet in the middle"" approach:** This phrase suggests flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  This counteroffer ensures I don't sell below my minimum price if Bob rejects it, allowing me to fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This would be a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better price from Bob.  He might keep lowering his offer.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

It's important to prioritize your financial goals and minimize risks. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at my target price, it makes more sense to close the deal and secure that profit."
