"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $200. This is more than you're willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
