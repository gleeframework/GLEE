Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair midpoint between our last offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows us to close this deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,350,000 is a good deal, and it's getting late in the negotiations. It's better to secure this sale than risk losing out entirely."
