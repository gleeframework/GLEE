"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential return on investment for your specific needs.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we need to find a middle ground. How about $900,000? This offer reflects my commitment to getting this deal done, but also acknowledges the inherent value of this product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
