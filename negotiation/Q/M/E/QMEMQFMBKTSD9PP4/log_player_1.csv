"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects this offer, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable amount. It's also the same price I can get from John. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and secure sale without the risk of further negotiation."
