"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $8000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the initial offer you made.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $10800 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",9800.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $9500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $8000.",9500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below my target price. I'm willing to make one last concession and offer it to you for $10200. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",10200.0,Alice,9,
