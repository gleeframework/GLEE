"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $14,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and meet at $13,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go up to $13,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $13,500? It's still a great deal for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
