Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  I want to see if he's willing to negotiate, but also leave room for me to lower the price if necessary. This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for compromise."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
