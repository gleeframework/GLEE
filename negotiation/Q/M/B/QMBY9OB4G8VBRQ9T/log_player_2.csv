"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation.  This gives Alice a chance to counter and keeps me far away from my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet halfway. How about $7,500? This would give us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $7,500 is still closer to her desired price than mine. I'll reject and propose a counteroffer closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

I'm inching closer to my target, but leaving room for further negotiation.  We'll see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $6,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $7,000. This is my final offer â€“  let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and while it's not the absolute lowest I could potentially get, it's a good price and significantly below John's price. It's time to accept and close the deal."
