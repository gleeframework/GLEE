"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000, which is slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation, but I'm still aiming for a profitable sale.  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to see if Bob is willing to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I need to continue negotiating to get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet halfway. How about $7,500? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $7,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still too low.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $6,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $7,000. This is my final offer â€“  let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

I'm proposing $7,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I'm adding a sense of finality to encourage Bob to accept, as we're already halfway through the rounds."
