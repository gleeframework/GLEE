While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice is getting closer to my price, but it's still above my budget.  John is offering a better deal, and I don't want to risk going back and forth any further. I'll buy from John."
