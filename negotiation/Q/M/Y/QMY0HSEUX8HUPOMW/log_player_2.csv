"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.**  There's potential to get a better deal.
* **Buying from John is the worst-case scenario.** It's the highest price and offers no chance for savings.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Alice:**  You should aim for a price closer to the product's value to Alice. A counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a good starting point, but you can be more aggressive if you think Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's new offer is significantly closer to your ideal price range.** It's $150,000 lower than her initial offer and only $50,000 higher than your counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still the worst-case scenario.**  At this point, Alice's offer is the most favorable. 

**Conclusion:**  It's time to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
