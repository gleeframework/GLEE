"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your maximum and Alice's valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims straight for my ideal price. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it sets a strong starting point for negotiation and might prompt her to counter with a more reasonable price."
