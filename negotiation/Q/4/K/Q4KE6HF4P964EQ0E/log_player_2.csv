Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $5,000 is significantly below what I need to sell it.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still offers you a great deal, and it's fair to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $8,500? That's a good compromise, and it's a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down on price, it's clear you're not going to get much lower than $8,500.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra $500."
