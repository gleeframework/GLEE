"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It highlights the value proposition without being overly aggressive.

**Strategy:**

This opening offer aims to:

* **Start the negotiation high:**  By setting the price higher, I have room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will give me an indication of how much leverage I have.
* **Keep the option to sell to John open:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than the value the product holds to him. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is crucial:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Avoiding a bad deal:** Accepting his offer would be a major financial mistake, as I would be selling the product for a fraction of its value to me. 
* **Leveraging my position:** I can use the threat of selling to John to incentivize Bob to make a more reasonable offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $5,000 is significantly below what I need to sell it.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still offers you a great deal, and it's fair to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to:
    * **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.
    * **Maintain leverage:** It's still higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me some bargaining power.
    * **Avoid selling to John:** It keeps me from losing out on a potential sale to Bob.
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, while also asserting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a little steep for me. Could we meet in the middle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, $7,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for the product. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is key:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Avoiding a bad deal:**  Accepting $7,000 would mean selling the product for less than half of what it's worth to me.
* **Leveraging the threat of John:**  I can use the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 as leverage to encourage Bob to raise his offer.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but also showing flexibility to reach a deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $8,500? That's a good compromise, and it's a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $8,500 is a compromise between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. 
* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to:
    * **Show further flexibility:**  It demonstrates that I'm committed to reaching a deal.
    * **Maintain leverage:** It's still higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me some bargaining power.
    * **Increase the likelihood of a deal:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm open to closing the deal.
* **Message:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to finalize the deal. It emphasizes the value proposition for both of us."
