{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and see where her ""bottom line"" might be.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but also making it clear I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, but it's moving in the right direction.  I'm going to reject and counter again, but this time I'll be more cautious about how much I lower the price, as I don't want to risk her getting too frustrated and walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so I'm hoping to find a middle ground.  This offer is still below my budget, but it demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to meet her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm going to reject and counter again, but I'll be mindful of the fact that I'm running out of rounds and need to be careful not to push her away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller margin.  Alice is showing a clear desire to close the deal, and I believe this offer is close enough to her potential bottom line to make her consider it seriously.  I'm also getting closer to my budget, and if she rejects, I'll be ready to buy from John in the next round if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  However, with only a few rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.  While I could buy from John now, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to come down further.  If she rejects, I'll purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise and close the deal. This price is still within my budget and leaves some room for a final agreement. If Alice rejects, I will purchase from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's down to the wire. Alice's offer is still above my budget, and with only one round left, it's not worth the risk of trying to negotiate further.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $800,000.  While it's not the ideal price, it's within my budget and ensures I secure the product."
