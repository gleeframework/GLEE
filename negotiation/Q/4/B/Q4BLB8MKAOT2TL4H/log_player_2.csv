# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $1,200,000. This is significantly more than Bob's target price.  It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's target price of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down closer to Bob's budget."
