"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for closer to $12,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showing Bob's seriousness in acquiring the product at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still hoping to get a lower price.  $13,500 is a good price, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Continuing the negotiation could lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to push for a lower price, but is also showing a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer meets Alice halfway from her previous offer, while still staying within Bob's budget.  This shows Bob's commitment to reaching a deal while staying within his price range."
