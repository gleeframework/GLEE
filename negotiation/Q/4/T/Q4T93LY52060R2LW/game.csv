"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'll find extremely valuable. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll recognize its potential. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is also willing to pay that amount.  Let me know if you're interested!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
