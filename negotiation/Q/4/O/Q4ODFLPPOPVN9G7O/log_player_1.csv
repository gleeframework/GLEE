This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me a starting point to potentially negotiate a higher price. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by reminding Bob that he may not be the only buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $115?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is closer to my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
