Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range where I believe there's room for negotiation. This sets a strong starting point for bargaining."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my target price.  I believe I can still push for a better deal by rejecting her offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to reach a price closer to my ideal.  This is a good compromise point to potentially reach an agreement."
