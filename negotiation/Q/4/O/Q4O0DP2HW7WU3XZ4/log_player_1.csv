"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but gives room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential earnings.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While $13,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $16,500. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I want to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain my value. Let's see if this price is more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'd like to get more, it's getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
