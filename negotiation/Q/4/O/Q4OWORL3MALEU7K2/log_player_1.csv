Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering the product at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Advantage:** This gives me room to negotiate downward if Bob counteroffers, while still allowing for a potentially profitable sale.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides me with a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room to negotiate.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold firm in negotiations and potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counter-offer of $13,500 is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not dropping too far below my desired price, maintaining leverage and indicating that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, highlighting that this price is still a good deal for him."
