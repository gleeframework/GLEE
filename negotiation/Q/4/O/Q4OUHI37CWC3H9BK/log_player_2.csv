You can do better than $10,000.  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but that's your limit. Let's see if you can get a better price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $10,500. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

You're still closer to your $9,000 goal than Alice's $10,500.  Let's see if you can get a little closer with a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can quite meet you at $9,750. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

You're getting close to your ideal price!  $10,200 is still a good deal for you, and it seems Alice is unlikely to budge much further.  Accepting her offer is a good move."
