{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget and a better price than John's offer.  You're saving $10 compared to John, and it's worth taking this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity."
