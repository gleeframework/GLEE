Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a reasonable return on my investment.  How about $850,000? This price gives you a solid profit margin, while still allowing me to cover my costs.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me. This product is worth a lot more than that. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This price is fair and allows for a profitable outcome for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice has come down to your maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and risking her raising the price again, or dragging out the negotiations when you already have the best possible deal."
