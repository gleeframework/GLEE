"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the market value and potential profit I can generate.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a reasonable return on my investment.  How about $850,000? This price gives you a solid profit margin, while still allowing me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, but $850,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we split the difference closer to your last offer at $750,000?  That price would allow me to make a fair profit while still ensuring you get a good return on your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but if he rejects this offer, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me. This product is worth a lot more than that. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This price is fair and allows for a profitable outcome for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
