Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Attractive to Bob:** This price is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I've left room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential negotiation.  
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1050000. This would still be a significant profit for you and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is still a profit, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There is still room to negotiate with Bob.  I believe I can secure a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Staying Optimistic:** It's worth trying to get a better price from Bob before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would still be a substantial profit for you, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm offering a counter-proposal that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Appeal to Shared Benefit:** I'm highlighting that this price benefits both of us - it's a good deal for Bob, while still being acceptable for me. 
* **Maintaining Confidence:** I'm remaining confident in the value of my product and my negotiating position."
