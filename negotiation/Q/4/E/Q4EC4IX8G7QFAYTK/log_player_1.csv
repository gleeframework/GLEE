Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Attractive Offer:**  $1,200,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation without risking a quick rejection.
* **Plan B:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price of $1,500,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $1,000,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Close to My Minimum:**  $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,500,000 and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making my offer more appealing.
* **Show Flexibility:**  By lowering my initial offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Avoid Selling to John:**  $1,100,000 is a better deal than selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** $1,050,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Further Negotiation is Unlikely:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly higher price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John at a lower price. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision to maximize my profit while minimizing risk."
