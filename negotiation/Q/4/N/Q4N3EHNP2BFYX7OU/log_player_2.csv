"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $9,500 for this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is good, it's still above Bob's maximum price. It's worth seeing if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I am proposing a price of $9,300 for the item. This is my best offer considering the value provided by the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,300 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer.  It's also only $300 more than Bob's counteroffer, and there's a chance Alice will not budge further.  Since there are 7 rounds left, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and save $700."
