"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to do business together. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 isn't a terrible price, you know you have a backup option at $15,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
