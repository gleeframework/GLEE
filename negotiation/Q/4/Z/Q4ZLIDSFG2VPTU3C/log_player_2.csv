Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $175 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for your offer! I really appreciate you coming down in price. However, $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $120 is a tough limit for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

While Alice's offer of $130 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $100.  You've already made it clear that you can't go higher, and there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further. To ensure you get the product within your budget, it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John."
