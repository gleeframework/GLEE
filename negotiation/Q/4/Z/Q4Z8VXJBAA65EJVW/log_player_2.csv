"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's much better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You know John is willing to sell for $10,000, so you have a solid baseline for your counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer sets your maximum price, and you are hoping Alice will accept it. It also shows you are serious about getting this product and are willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget.  While it's closer to your maximum, it's still not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. You have a guaranteed deal with John for $10,000, so it's the most logical choice to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
