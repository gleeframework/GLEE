"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than $12,000. Considering its significance to you, I propose a price of $14,000 for the product. This price reflects its true worth while ensuring a fair deal for both parties. I trust this offer will meet your expectations and allow us to proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000, Bob can still do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller willing to sell the product for less."
