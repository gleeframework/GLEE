"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original price. How about $90? Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $90 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  How about $85? This would be a good middle ground, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd be willing to go up to $78, which is a fair offer considering your original price and my limit.  What do you say?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need to be closer to $85. Would you consider $82? It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize a deal.",82.0,Alice,7,
