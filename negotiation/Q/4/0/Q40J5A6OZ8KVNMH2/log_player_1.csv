"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've expressed interest in.  I'm asking $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Reasonable but firm:** $110 is a reasonable price considering my minimum value is $100. This shows I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a higher price.
* **Exploring options:** By rejecting, I can counter with a price closer to what I want, and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a backup:** John offers a guaranteed $100, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer.  I have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original price. How about $90? Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my original offer, but still staying above my minimum value.
* **Finding middle ground:**  $90 is a reasonable compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm open to negotiation but also value the product.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation flowing.
* **Emphasis on negotiation:** I'm reminding Bob that we're working towards finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $90 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell at a loss.
* **Potential for compromise:** Bob is showing willingness to meet in the middle. This suggests we might be able to reach an agreement closer to my desired price in the next round. 
* **John is a secure alternative:**  Having John as a backup option gives me confidence to reject low offers. I'm not pressured to accept just to sell the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  How about $85? This would be a good middle ground, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm continuing to show flexibility by coming down from my previous offer. 
* **Focusing on compromise:** I'm emphasizing the idea of finding a solution that works for both of us, which could help build consensus.
* **Fair price argument:** I'm using language like ""good middle ground"" and ""fair price"" to try to sway Bob's perspective.
* **Confidence in the offer:** I'm expressing confidence that this price is reasonable, which could increase Bob's willingness to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd be willing to go up to $78, which is a fair offer considering your original price and my limit.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's message suggests he's willing to negotiate further.  There's a chance we can reach an agreement closer to my target price.
* **John is a secure option:** Having John as a backup gives me the flexibility to reject offers that are too low. I'm not pressured to accept just to make a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need to be closer to $85. Would you consider $82? It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 82} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving slightly:** I'm increasing my offer by a small amount, showing that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the compromise:** I emphasize that $82 is a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Building towards a deal:** I use phrases like ""finalise a deal"" to nudge Bob towards accepting and closing the negotiation.
* **Remaining firm:** While I'm willing to come down, I'm not going below my minimum acceptable price."
