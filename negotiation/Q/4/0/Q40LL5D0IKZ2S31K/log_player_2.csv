"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's more than double what the product is worth to me. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

My initial counteroffer is a bit more than halfway between Alice's asking price and my maximum budget. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a fair starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of her before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little too high for me.  How about $140?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again going for a middle ground, but this time it's closer to my target price. I'm being firm but also showing willingness to compromise. I hope this will get us closer to a deal."
