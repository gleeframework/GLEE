"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in this product, though. How about $130? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $130 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $135? That way we both get a fair price.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $132? It's just a little closer to what I'm looking for, and I think we can both be happy with that.",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you - you're trying to get the best price. But $132 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $133? It's just a dollar more, but I think it's a fair compromise.",133.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're close. I'm willing to go up to $131, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",131.0,Bob,6,
