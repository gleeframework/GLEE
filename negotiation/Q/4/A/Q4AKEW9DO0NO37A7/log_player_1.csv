Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob. It also positions the offer as a mutually beneficial deal. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Initiate the negotiation:**  By offering a price, I start the conversation and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** A $12,000 price leaves space for me to potentially go lower if necessary.
* **Maintain a safety net:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers up to $8,000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, aiming to secure a better deal. I'm confident I can negotiate a price closer to my desired range, and I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to offer the product for $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $10,000:** This price is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. It demonstrates flexibility while still ensuring I earn significantly more than Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasize fairness and mutual benefit:** The message reiterates understanding of Bob's budget while highlighting the value of the product and the potential for both of us to gain from this deal. 
* **Positive tone:** Using phrases like ""make this happen"" keeps the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to reach an agreement.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By moving from $12,000 to $10,000, I signal that I'm open to negotiation, increasing Bob's chances of accepting.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  $10,000 is still a considerable distance from my minimum acceptable price, giving me room for further negotiations if needed. 
* **Increase the likelihood of a deal:** Offering a more realistic price while maintaining a positive tone can help us reach a mutually agreeable conclusion."
