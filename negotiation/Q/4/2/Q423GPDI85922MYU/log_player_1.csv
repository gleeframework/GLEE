{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, appealing to his sense of getting a bargain.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that this is a starting point, signaling willingness to negotiate further. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximizes Potential Earnings:** By starting high, I increase the chances of getting a higher price.
* **Shows Confidence:**  A strong opening price demonstrates confidence in the value of the product.
* **Sets the Tone:**  This approach encourages Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation moving. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and respond accordingly, aiming to get as close to my desired $12,000 as possible. 
* If negotiations stall or seem unproductive, I will leverage the option of selling to John for $12,000 as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial assessment of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to continue negotiating.
* **Signal my value:** It reinforces the perceived value of my product, potentially encouraging Bob to increase his offer.
* **Explore potential for a better deal:** By continuing the negotiation, I might be able to achieve a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll use this opportunity to try and understand Bob's motivations and find common ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I understand you're trying to save money, but this product is truly unique and worth every penny.
