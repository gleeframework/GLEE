"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I understand you're trying to save money, but this product is truly unique and worth every penny.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $9,750. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us.  What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I'll have to stop if it's rejected. I propose $9,900. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate you sticking to your word. However, $9,900 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's split the difference and agree on $10,050.  This is a small compromise that allows both of us to come to an agreement.  What do you say?",10050.0,Alice,7,
