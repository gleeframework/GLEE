I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still holding out for a price closer to $1,100,000. There's still time to get a better deal, and selling to John is always an option if things fall through."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and your desire to save money.  However, $1,075,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,087,500?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1087500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  We're getting closer, but I'm not ready to settle for $1,070,000 yet.  I'm confident I can get a slightly better price, especially since John is always a viable option."
