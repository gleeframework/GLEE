Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $95 leaves room for a few rounds of counteroffers before I have to accept a price lower than my minimum.
* **Positive and friendly tone:** A friendly approach can help keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John at $100 is a sure thing, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While $85 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price from $95 to $90.
* **Maintain Value:**  $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I'm not losing out on much.
* **Positive Tone:** A positive tone and a clear explanation of my reasoning can help keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to reach an agreement at $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited Upside:**  We're getting close to my minimum, and further negotiation with Bob might not get me much closer to my desired price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John at $100 ensures a secure sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
