"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay up to $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product for $180. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $180 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to sell the product for $150, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price that's in the middle of $180 and $150, so I'm offering the product for $165. Let me know if this is more acceptable to you.",165.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $155 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",155.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price that's in the middle of $165 and $155, so I'm offering the product for $160. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",160.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I think we're getting close too! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $155, so I'm offering $157.50 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",157.5,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $160. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that normally costs $20, so the total value you'll be getting is actually $180. I'm sticking with my price of $160. Let me know if this is a deal you're willing to accept.",160.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $155 for the product, and I'll take the free accessory as a bonus. Can you consider my offer?",155.0,Bob,10,
