Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is lower than what I initially hoped for, it's still better than selling to John at $1,200,000.  I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I have 8 more rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $1,250,000?  This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe we can both be satisfied with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum desired price, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum. I have 6 more rounds left, so I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price."
