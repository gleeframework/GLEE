"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the maximum value of the product to Bob is $100, there's no point in accepting Alice's initial offer. By rejecting, Bob can potentially get a lower price. He still has the option to buy from John for $100 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a strong negotiating position and shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal. Offering $75 leaves room for negotiation and avoids immediate rejection."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's maximum price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to potentially get a lower price.  It also keeps the pressure on Alice to make a more favorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating that he's willing to pay a little more but still wants a good deal. Offering $80 keeps the negotiation moving and is a reasonable compromise, potentially leading to a successful agreement."
