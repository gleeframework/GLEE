"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $8,500, I can still do better. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, and I'm not desperate to sell. I'm not going to sell to John just yet, because I have 10 rounds and I believe that I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility but still keeping the price above my minimum. Hopefully, this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a further reduction from my previous offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for a low price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to accept $8,000 since it's my minimum, I've already shown flexibility in my counteroffers. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point in the remaining rounds. There's no rush to sell to John yet, as I still have a good chance of closing a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}

This is my last offer, and I'm going to go just a little bit lower to $8,800. I'm feeling the pressure of time, but I'm not going to sell for anything less. If Bob rejects this, I will sell to John."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
