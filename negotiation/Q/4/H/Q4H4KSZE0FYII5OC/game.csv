"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to get the product.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your spirit, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $85. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $92.50? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",92.5,Alice,5,
