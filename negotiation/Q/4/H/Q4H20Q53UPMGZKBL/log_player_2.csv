```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $870,000 is still within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price than John's offer of $800,000. It's a reasonable compromise and allows Bob to secure the product without further negotiation."
