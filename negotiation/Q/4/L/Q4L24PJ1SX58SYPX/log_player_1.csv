{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still leaves you with a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** This makes the offer appealing to Bob and avoids you having to immediately accept John's offer. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This helps to keep the negotiation focused and efficient. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value. It's worth trying to negotiate with Bob further. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, so I will accept it.  It's a good outcome -  I get my minimum, and Bob gets a good deal."
