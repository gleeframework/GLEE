"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to compromise. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum of $1,500,000, but still attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but I can still do better. I'm rejecting this offer and will counter with a price that is closer to my desired outcome in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  This should encourage Bob to come up with a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want it to be. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push him a little further in the next round.  I want to see if we can close the deal without resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm taking a slightly more aggressive stance this round. I'm reducing my price to $1,550,000, which is only $50,000 above my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product but also that I'm not willing to settle for much less than my target price.  I'm hoping this will push Bob to make a final concession and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. It's clear that we're not going to be able to reach an agreement that is beneficial to me.  Since I'm running out of rounds, and I have a guaranteed offer from John, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
