"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  I'm confident that this product offers significantly more potential than your initial offer reflects. I could consider coming down to $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm willing to offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
