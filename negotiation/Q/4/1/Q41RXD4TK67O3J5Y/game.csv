"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't agree to $11000. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go as low as $9500.  The product is worth a significant amount to me, and I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counter with $10500. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $10500. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000, which is the maximum I am willing to pay. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
