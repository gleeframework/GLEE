"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $11,000? This is a substantial discount from my original offer and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10500.0,Bob,4,
