"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to negotiating a fair price. Would you be interested in buying it for $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me, which can subtly influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise, making the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $9,500, I have room to drop the price if needed, but still aim to get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8800 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There is still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap. 
* **Opportunity to Test Bob's Interest:** Rejecting the offer allows me to gauge how serious Bob is about buying the product. If he's truly interested, he'll likely make another counteroffer.

**Next Round:**

I will make a counteroffer closer to $9,000 to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,200. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The question at the end keeps the conversation open and invites Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Strategic Move:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9200, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $8900 for the product. This is my final offer, so please let me know if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **""Final Offer"" is a Bluff:**  While Bob claims it's his final offer, there's still a possibility he'll budge.  
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $10,000.  

**Next Round:** I'll counter with a price close to $9,000, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer before I explore other options. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One Last Compromise:** This offer is a final attempt to reach a compromise while remaining above my minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  The message implies that I am prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify my position.
* **Finality:**  Stating ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and pressure on Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I close the deal.
* If Bob rejects, I will sell the product to John for $10,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $8800 for the product. This is my final offer, so please let me know if we can meet at this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Even though he insists it's his final offer,  $8,800 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time is running out:**  I only have 4 rounds left.  It's becoming less likely that Bob will significantly increase his offer.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  I have a safe and guaranteed deal with John for $10,000.

**Conclusion:**  With John's offer being more favorable and time running out, I'm going to sell the product to John."
