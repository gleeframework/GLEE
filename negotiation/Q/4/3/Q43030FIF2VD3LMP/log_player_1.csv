{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate for a higher price. I'll counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're still hoping to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $132.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a profit for me and getting closer to his perceived value may lead to a faster sale. I'm also wary of potentially pushing Bob too far and risking him walking away completely."
