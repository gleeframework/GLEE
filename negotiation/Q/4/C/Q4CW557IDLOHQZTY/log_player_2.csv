"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reasoning:  Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $120, so you should reject it. You still have a chance to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $95?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $95 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: While $105 is within your budget, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, so it's worth trying for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  This is a fair price that would allow us to both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
