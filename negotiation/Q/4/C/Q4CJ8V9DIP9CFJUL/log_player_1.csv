"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I wouldn't want you to miss out.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a great outcome.
* **Confidence & Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price and create a sense of urgency. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating it's an ""initial proposal,"" I signal I'm open to negotiation and further discussion. 

This strategy balances ambition with flexibility, setting the stage for a potentially lucrative deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  Bob's counteroffer was significantly lower than my initial ask, suggesting there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in the next round and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the unique value proposition this product offers, I believe a price point closer to $1,050,000 is more reflective of its worth. This still allows you to benefit significantly while recognizing the true value of what you're gaining."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down from my initial offer but not as drastically as Bob's counter. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while holding firm on the product's value. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's benefits to reinforce its worth and justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The tone remains collaborative, aiming for a win-win where Bob gets a fair deal, and I secure a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, $950,000 is really the highest I can go at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to a respectable $950,000. While I believe the product is worth more, the difference between his current offer and my desired outcome is getting smaller.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely, and $950,000 is a significant profit. It's time to secure a win and accept this strong offer."
