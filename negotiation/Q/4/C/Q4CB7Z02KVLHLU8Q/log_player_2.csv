"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget. It's best to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my research, I believe a fair starting point for this product would be $1,200,000.  This reflects its value to me, and I'm open to discussing further adjustments to reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000? This recognizes its true worth while offering you a considerable reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  Let's compromise at $1,400,000. This represents a significant reduction from your initial offer and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
