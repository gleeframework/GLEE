"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my research, I believe a fair starting point for this product would be $1,200,000.  This reflects its value to me, and I'm open to discussing further adjustments to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000? This recognizes its true worth while offering you a considerable reduction from my initial offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  Let's compromise at $1,400,000. This represents a significant reduction from your initial offer and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
