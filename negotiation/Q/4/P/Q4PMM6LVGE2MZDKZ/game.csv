"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,700,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
