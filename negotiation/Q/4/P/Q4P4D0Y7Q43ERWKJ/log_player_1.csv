""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair.  This is a significant discount compared to your own valuation, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial agreement."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product significantly higher than our minimum selling price and John's offer. This allows us to aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still keeping us well above our minimum.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if simple, can make it appear more reasonable and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat risk-averse. If he's willing to walk away from a good deal to try and get an even better one, a lower initial offer might be safer.
* **Alternative Buyers:** Having John as a backup buyer gives us a strong negotiating position, as we are not desperate to sell at any price."
