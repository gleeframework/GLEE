"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering its worth to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  $14,000 is still too high for him, and he wants to save as much as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he prefers a lower price, $13,000 is still within his budget and a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  This is a fair compromise, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price."
