"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to immediately accept the first offer.  It's likely Alice is starting high, hoping to get that price. By rejecting, we can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. It also leaves room for compromise in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, there's still room for improvement.  I'm not ready to commit yet, as I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price, especially considering Alice's previous counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $15,000 to $12,000, demonstrating flexibility. I'm increasing my offer slightly from $10,000 to $11,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within my acceptable range. This should hopefully push us closer to a deal in the next round."
