"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential benefits of this product, $500000 is a bit too steep for my current budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it,  which is still a significant investment for me.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand that $500000 was outside your budget, but I would like to present you with a more flexible option. I am now offering the product at a price of $750000. This is still a significant discount compared to the original price, and I believe it presents a great opportunity for you to benefit from the product's features without a full upfront investment. Please let me know if this revised offer suits your financial situation better.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $750000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably commit to right now.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while also staying within my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After carefully considering your proposal, I am now offering the product at a price of $900000. This is the lowest price I can offer while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is fair given its unique features and benefits. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I value the product and recognize its potential,  $900000 is still slightly outside my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $880000. This is a small step closer to your last offer and a good compromise for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",880000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your patience and flexibility, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am now offering the product at a price of $895000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it strikes a balance between our interests. I am confident that the product's unique features and benefits justify this price point. I hope this revised offer will enable us to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",895000.0,Alice,7,
