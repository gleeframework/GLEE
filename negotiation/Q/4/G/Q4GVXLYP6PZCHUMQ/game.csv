"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $120? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $120 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. Could we possibly settle around $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $75, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $75. How about we try $97.50? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Alice,5,
