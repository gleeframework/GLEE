"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $825,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. While $750,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise further. I propose a price of $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

This is a good price point for the product and Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Accepting now prevents the risk of having to buy from John at the higher price."
