Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its immense value proposition."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while ensuring a sale.
* **High but Reasonable:**  $925,000 leaves Bob with a $75,000 gain, a significant incentive to buy.  
* **Alternative in Mind:** Offering slightly below Bob's maximum ensures you're not leaving too much money on the table. You have a guaranteed $800,000 from John if Bob declines."
