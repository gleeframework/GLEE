Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you start high to maximize your potential profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate while staying significantly above his perceived value.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the product's ""potential"" subtly hints at its worth beyond what Bob might currently see. 

**Why not aim lower?:**

While you could start lower (e.g., $1,000,000),  it's riskier. Bob might accept immediately, leaving potential profit on the table. This approach balances ambition with the security of your backup buyer."
