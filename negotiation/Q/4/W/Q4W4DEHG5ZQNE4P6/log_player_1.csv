Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **50% Markup:**  The offered price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a level of desirability and urgency for Bob to consider. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Bob's response will determine your next move.  Be prepared to negotiate if he pushes back, but always keep your bottom line ($1,500,000) in mind."
