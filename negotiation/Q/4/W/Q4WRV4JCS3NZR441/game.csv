"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? I would like to make a counteroffer of $7,500.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,200.  This still gives you a good price, and it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to make a counteroffer at $8,100. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",8100.0,Bob,4,
