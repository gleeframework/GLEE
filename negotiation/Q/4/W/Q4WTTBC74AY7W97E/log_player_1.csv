I'm going to sell the product to John. It's becoming clear that I'm not going to be able to get a price from Bob that's close to what I need. I've already rejected several offers from Bob, and I'm getting nervous that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away altogether. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's much closer to my minimum."
