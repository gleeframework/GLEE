"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is a substantial investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
