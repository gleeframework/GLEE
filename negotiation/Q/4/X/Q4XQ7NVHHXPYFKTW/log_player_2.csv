Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you while also acknowledging your budget constraints.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My revised offer is $920,000. This price reflects the product's value while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
