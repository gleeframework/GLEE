"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting.  You can reject her offer and still buy the product from John for the same price."
