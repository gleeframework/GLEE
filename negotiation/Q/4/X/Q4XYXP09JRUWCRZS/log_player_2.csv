"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting very close to John's price of $1,500,000. At this point, the potential for further negotiation is low, and the risk of Alice rejecting Bob's next counteroffer is high. It's more efficient for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation rounds."
