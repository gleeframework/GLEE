"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident in the product's value exceeding $700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
