"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $13000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $12000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept this offer, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $12000 is your maximum, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13500. It's a fair compromise considering the value it brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
