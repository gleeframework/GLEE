"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can always sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can always sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I can go down to $950,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a significant value for you, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, $825,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 4 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can always sell to John for my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price and see if we can find some common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $825,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one last compromise and come down to $925,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $820,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we won't be able to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer of $820,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's unlikely he will come closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, it's better to sell the product to John for my desired price of $1,200,000 and avoid the risk of losing out on a better deal."
