"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I can go down to $950,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a significant value for you, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $825,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one last compromise and come down to $925,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $820,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we won't be able to come to an agreement.",820000.0,Bob,8,
