"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $13,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's no immediate need to buy from John since the negotiation has just begun."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is below his maximum budget of $12,000 but also leaves room for negotiation. A counteroffer of $11,500 starts the negotiation process and allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob might be able to secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation. Buying from John at this point would be a worse outcome than continuing to try and negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now willing to pay his maximum price of $12,000. This is a significant step in the negotiation, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product. By making this offer, Bob hopes to finalize the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or needing to buy from John."
