"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $850000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. While I'm confident in its worth, I understand if this price doesn't work for you. If you decline, I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $800000. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
