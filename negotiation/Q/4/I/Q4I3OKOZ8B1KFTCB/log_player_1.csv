{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a decent amount, I'm not willing to settle that low just yet. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to drop my price a bit, but not too much.  I believe $1,200,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  We'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and while I'm getting closer to my ""sell to John"" price, I'm still holding out hope of getting a better deal. I'll counter again, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway at $1,000,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping he'll accept it. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly low, and I'm nearing the point where I'm risking losing too much money if I continue.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. I'm confident that I can still make a decent profit, and this will prevent the negotiations from dragging on any further."
