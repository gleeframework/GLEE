Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) than mine ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""a great deal"") might make the price more palatable. 
* **Alternative:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100. If negotiations with Bob stall significantly, I can always choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's initial counter-offer suggests he's willing to pay more than my minimum.  I'll aim for a price closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that benefits me.
* **Target Price:** $110 represents a fair compromise, giving both me and Bob a good deal. 
* **Observation:** Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests he's genuinely interested in the product, giving me leverage to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $107?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $107 represents a $7 profit over my minimum acceptable price and a significant gain over selling to John.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk alienating Bob, especially since he's framed his offer as a ""fair compromise."" Further haggling might lead to him walking away.
* **Time Value:** Reaching a deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations. This quick sale allows me to move on to other business opportunities."
