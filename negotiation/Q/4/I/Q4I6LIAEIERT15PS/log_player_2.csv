"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $100. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can strike a deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $100. Alice's offer is $100.  Since you know you can get the product from John for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but there's no guarantee."
