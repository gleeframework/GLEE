Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $160 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $180 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: Bob is unwilling to go above $150, which is the same amount John is offering. There's no point in further negotiation with Bob. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
