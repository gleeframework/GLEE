"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $16,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",10000.0,Bob,4,
