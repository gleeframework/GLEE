Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $16,000."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $16,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is firm at $10,000 and unlikely to budge. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than to waste more time potentially getting less from Bob."
