"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still more than the product is worth to you.  You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $95 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial price. Would you consider $105? It's a small compromise that still reflects the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to your ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get the price down a bit further by counteroffering again."
