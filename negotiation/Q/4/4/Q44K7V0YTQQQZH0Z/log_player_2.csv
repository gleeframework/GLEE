"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my maximum price ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals to Alice that her initial offer is far off. 
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:** My goal is to get the best possible price, even if it means multiple rounds of negotiation.
* **Backup Option:**  I keep in mind that I can always buy the product from John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, the value of this product to me is significantly higher.  I could consider letting it go for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down in price, but $11,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum budget and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's message implies some flexibility (""could consider"").  There's potential to negotiate a better price.
* **Alternative Exists:** I will continue to negotiate strategically, keeping in mind I have the option to buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you considering my offer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000, but $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  I'm making a significant jump from my previous offer ($6,000 to $7,000) to show Alice I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Still Below Max:**  My offer is still below my maximum budget ($8,000) and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Testing Alice's Limit:** This offer will help me gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
