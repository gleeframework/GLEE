"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $950000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear you think it's a good value. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $825000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and value the product.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $825000. I'm willing to go up to $775000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and should allow you to still profit from the sale.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $810000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, while also allowing me to earn a reasonable profit.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $810000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $790000, which is very close to my budget and would give you a fair profit on the sale.  Let's try to find a compromise that benefits both of us.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $820000. I'm willing to meet you at $795000, which is a compromise that should work for both of us. I'm getting a bit concerned that we're running out of time, so I hope we can finalize a deal soon.",795000.0,Alice,7,
