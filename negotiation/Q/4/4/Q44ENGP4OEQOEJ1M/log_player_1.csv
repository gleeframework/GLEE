Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd be willing to sell to John, as there's room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob, but if he rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is still above my minimum, but it shows a willingness to compromise. It's also a good middle ground considering Bob's offer and my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $145 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting a lower price."
