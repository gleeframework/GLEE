{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, while still being within your budget. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while setting a clear target.  It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, leaving space for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, but closer to what I'm willing to pay.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives me another chance to potentially get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents my final offer, as it's exactly my maximum budget. It demonstrates my strong desire to reach an agreement while staying within my financial limits.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be forced to buy from John, but at least I've tried to get the best possible price from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer, while slightly lower than before, is still above my maximum budget.  At this point, the negotiation seems to be getting difficult, and there's no guarantee that further counteroffers will be successful. To avoid risking further time and potentially ending up paying more, I'll choose to buy from John.  His price is within my budget and offers a guaranteed purchase without the risk of further negotiation."
