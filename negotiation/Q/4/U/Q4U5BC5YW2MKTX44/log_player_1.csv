Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I make a profit. I'll see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below what I consider the product's true value.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at the minimum I'm willing to accept. While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk of Bob rejecting further offers and potentially delaying the sale. Selling to Bob for $12,000 is the best option to secure the deal and avoid any potential issues with further negotiation."
