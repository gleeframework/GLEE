"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I know its worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1400000. This represents a significant saving for you, and it allows me to secure a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price point ($1,500,000).**  You're looking to spend no more than $1,500,000, and her offer is $1,400,000.
* **You have a better alternative:** John is willing to sell the product for your maximum budget of $1,500,000.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $100,000."
