,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $8,500. How about we compromise at $8,750? ",8750.0,Bob,4,
