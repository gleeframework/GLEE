Bob is very unlikely to move significantly from his $950,000 offer. It's clear that further negotiation with him will yield minimal returns. Accepting his current offer at $987,500 represents a significant loss compared to John's standing offer.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
