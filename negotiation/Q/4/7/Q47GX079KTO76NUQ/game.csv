"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only able to go as high as $750,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which still leaves some room for profit for you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can avoid any further negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,4,
