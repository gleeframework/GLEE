"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know your thoughts.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I'm really looking to get it for under $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible.  I'm willing to go down to $135, which is still a fair price for this product.  I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $127.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",127.5,Bob,6,
