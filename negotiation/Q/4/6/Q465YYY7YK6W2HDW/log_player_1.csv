{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's value but below your minimum. This allows for negotiation while still leaving room for profit. The friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer and continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I'm really looking to get it for under $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible.  I'm willing to go down to $135, which is still a fair price for this product.  I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $127.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could continue to negotiate with him, I'm concerned that it could take several more rounds and I might end up accepting a price that's too low.  Selling to John for $150 ensures I get my minimum, and it's the best option for me at this point."
