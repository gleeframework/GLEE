"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's less than what the product is worth to Bob, but still more than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial target price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135.  It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still pushing for a higher price.  I believe this could be a good middle ground for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $128 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to accept his offer. It's better than selling to John, and it ensures I don't risk losing the deal entirely in the remaining rounds."
