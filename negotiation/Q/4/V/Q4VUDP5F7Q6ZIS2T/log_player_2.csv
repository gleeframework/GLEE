"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm interested in the product, but  $600,000 would be a more realistic starting point for me.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,200,000. This reflects the unique nature of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While the product is unique, $1,200,000 is still a big stretch for me. Could we meet somewhere closer to the middle, perhaps around $750,000? "",
""product_price"": 750000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for us both.  How about we try a price of $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while respecting the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but her ""final offer"" of $1,000,000 is still higher than your maximum budget.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice if you are not willing to pay more than John's price."
