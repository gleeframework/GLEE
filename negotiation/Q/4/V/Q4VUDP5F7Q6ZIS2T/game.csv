"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm interested in the product, but  $600,000 would be a more realistic starting point for me.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,200,000. This reflects the unique nature of what I'm offering.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While the product is unique, $1,200,000 is still a big stretch for me. Could we meet somewhere closer to the middle, perhaps around $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for us both.  How about we try a price of $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while respecting the value of this product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
