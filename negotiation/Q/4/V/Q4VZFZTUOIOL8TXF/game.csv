"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to accept $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1100000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1100000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.
