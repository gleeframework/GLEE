"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You should reject the offer.  While it's tempting to get a deal, you can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $105 is a bit too low for me, though. How about $110?  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get at least that much for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer again. You are still in a good position to negotiate a lower price.  $110 is still higher than your target of $120, and you can likely get a better deal."
