"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $105 is a bit too low for me, though. How about $110?  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get at least that much for it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's meet in the middle at $108. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can make it work.",108.0,Bob,4,
