{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my desired range, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. It's better to secure a good profit than to keep pushing for a slightly higher price and potentially end up with nothing."
