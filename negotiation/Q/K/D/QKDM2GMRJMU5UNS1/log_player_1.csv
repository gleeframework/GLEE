Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's of great value and would be beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering $119 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he's prone to negotiation.
* **Secure the Sale:**  Offering a price too close to $120 might make Bob hesitate or think he can get it cheaper. $119 is a strong offer that likely won't scare him away while still securing a significant profit for Alice."
