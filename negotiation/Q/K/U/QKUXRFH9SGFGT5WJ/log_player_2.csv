"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum price of $120. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** You can try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer.**  You're aiming to get the price closer to your ideal range while leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Be polite but firm.** You want to show Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you also need to establish your price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my original price. How about $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above your ideal price range. 
* **You have time to negotiate further.** With 7 rounds remaining, there's opportunity to continue bargaining.
* **Buying from John is still an option.**  You can always buy from John if the negotiation with Alice stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Make a smaller counteroffer this time.**  You've shown you're willing to negotiate, and now you're getting closer to her price.
* **Maintain a friendly tone.** This helps keep the negotiation positive and encourages Alice to be more flexible. 
* **Suggest a compromise.** By saying ""Let's see if we can find a compromise,"" you show a willingness to work together."
