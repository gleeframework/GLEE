Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $925,000. This is my final offer, as I don't want to go any higher. Can you consider it?

While I'd love to push for more, Bob's offer of $925,000 is a solid deal. It's within my acceptable range and I'm confident I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
