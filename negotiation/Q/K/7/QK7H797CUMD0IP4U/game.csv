"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I am willing to offer $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your constraints, however, the value of this product is significant and $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would still represent a substantial saving for you while recognizing the product's true worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I must respectfully decline at $1,025,000. I am now offering $1,000,000. I hope this proposal is closer to what you're considering.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
