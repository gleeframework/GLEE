I'm starting with a price that is slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to choose to sell the product to him for $15,000. This ensures I get the highest possible value for the product and minimizes the time and effort spent in further negotiations."
