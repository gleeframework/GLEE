Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, she seems pretty firm at this point and unlikely to meet my $12,000 maximum. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation potentially leading nowhere. I have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000, saving me a significant amount compared to Alice's last offer."
