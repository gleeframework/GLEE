"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing for a smooth transaction. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
