,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $165, which is a bit more than your offer, but still a good deal for both of us.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $140. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $140, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $157.50? It's a fair compromise that still gives me a good profit.",157.5,Alice,5,
