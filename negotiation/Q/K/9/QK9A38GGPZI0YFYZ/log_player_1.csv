Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think it would be very valuable to you, but I need to sell it quickly. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob values the product at $120, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to surprise you by accepting. 
* **Creating urgency:**  Mentioning a need to sell quickly might encourage Bob to act fast and accept your offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer of $135 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you get a price above his perceived value and above what John is offering."
