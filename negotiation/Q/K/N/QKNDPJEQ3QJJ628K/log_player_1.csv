Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll try to negotiate further and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will still be a great investment for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While he's getting closer to my minimum price, $920,000 is still too low. I'll try to counter with a higher price to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still not able to go lower than $940,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the value of this product to you. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still not willing to budge, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $930,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but with Bob's final offer at $930,000, I'm still too far away from my minimum price of $1,200,000. It's better to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 and avoid further negotiation that may not lead to a satisfactory result."
