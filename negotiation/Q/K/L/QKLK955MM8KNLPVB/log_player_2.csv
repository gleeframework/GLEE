Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $700,000 is still a significant gap from what I have in mind.  Let's try $825,000.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $825,000.  It's better to secure the product at your target price from John rather than risk Alice sticking to her ""final offer"" and missing out."
