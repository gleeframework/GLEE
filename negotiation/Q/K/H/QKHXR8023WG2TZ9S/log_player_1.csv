Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $150 but offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to accept. I'm also reiterating my desire for a good deal for both of us, hoping to make him feel like we're working together towards a solution."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try $150. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but it's still a good price for you considering the value of the product. I really want to make this deal work, so let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price, emphasizing that it's the lowest I can go.  I'm also expressing my eagerness to make the deal work, hoping to push Bob towards accepting."
