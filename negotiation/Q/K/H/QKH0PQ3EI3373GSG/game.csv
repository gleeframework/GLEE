"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. I'm offering $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position.  However, I believe $1,300,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's true value and potential impact for your company.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but my counteroffer is $1,350,000. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I think we can get even closer to a mutually beneficial solution. I'm offering $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer to an agreement, and I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but my counteroffer is $1,300,000.  This reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a final agreement that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I think we can get even closer to a mutually beneficial solution. I'm offering $1,225,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your ongoing efforts to reach a deal.  While I'm willing to continue negotiating, $1,225,000 is still a bit too low considering the value this product brings. I'm making one final counteroffer of $1,275,000. This represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and see the benefits it brings to your business.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
