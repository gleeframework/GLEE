Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, and we have a guaranteed offer of $15,000, starting with a high offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, we can always lower the price.  By starting high, we give ourselves a buffer to potentially secure a price higher than $15,000.
* **Anchoring:** A high initial offer might anchor Bob's perception of the product's value, making him more receptive to a lower (but still profitable) counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk appetite, other approaches might be viable."
