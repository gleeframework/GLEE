{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message to build rapport. The price of $100 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you get more than your minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is the lowest I can go. This still gives you a good deal, considering the product is worth $120 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum of $80. While I'd like to get more, it's not worth risking losing the sale altogether and having to sell to John for less."
