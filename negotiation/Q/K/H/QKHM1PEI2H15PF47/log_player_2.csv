"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $150. It's a real steal! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no immediate reason to accept, as you might be able to get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  It's worth exploring if you can get the product for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to consider $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $130 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $140? I'm sure we can find a happy middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $150 to $140.  This is a good compromise and falls within your budget.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that you'll get a lower price, and you risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option at this point."
