"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you think?

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 9500}
