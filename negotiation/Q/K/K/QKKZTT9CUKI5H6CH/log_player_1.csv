{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's a valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product.  It gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for me.  If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I will reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $9,500? It's a compromise, and I think it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, his final offer of $9,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. To ensure I get at least my desired price, I will sell the product to John for $10,000."
