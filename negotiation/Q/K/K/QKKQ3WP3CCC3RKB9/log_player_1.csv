Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a higher final price.
* **Secure the Higher Sale:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, Bob represents a potential $200,000+ increase in profit. It's strategically advantageous to aim for the higher sale first."
