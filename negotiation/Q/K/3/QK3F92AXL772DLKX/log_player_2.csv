"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase our product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal that will benefit both of us. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that will leave both of us satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's no reason to pay more than your absolute maximum. By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave the door open for her to potentially counter with a better price, but you secure your fallback option with John."
