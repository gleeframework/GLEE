"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, there's no benefit to negotiating further.  You might get a better deal with Alice, but there's also the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and the negotiation dragging on.  Buying from John guarantees the product at your maximum price, eliminating any risk and time investment."
