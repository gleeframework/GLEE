Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing its value to him. This is to encourage him to consider accepting the offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm trying to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer as my fallback options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $950000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000.  While I'm aiming to get the best price possible, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is too far below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  My counter-offer of $1,050,000 is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's initial offer while emphasizing that $1,050,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product. I frame it as a win-win situation for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness. If he's genuinely interested, he might be willing to meet me halfway. If not, I can still fall back on John's offer or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $975000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I am open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise significantly on the value of my product.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob once more, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. If he continues to refuse, I will sell to John, securing my minimum price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and represents a significant compromise from my side.  It's the best I can do at this point. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** This offer of $1,000,000 is a compromise. It's my minimum acceptable price, but still represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer.
