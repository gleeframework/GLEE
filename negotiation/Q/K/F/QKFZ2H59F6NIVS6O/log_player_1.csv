Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $8,000 from John. This strategy prioritizes potentially getting a higher price from Bob."
