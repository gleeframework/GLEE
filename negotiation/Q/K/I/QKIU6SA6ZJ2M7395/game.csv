"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify paying around $1,200,000 for it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $1,400,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
