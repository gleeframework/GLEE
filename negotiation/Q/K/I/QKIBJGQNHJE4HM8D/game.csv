"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Bob,4,
