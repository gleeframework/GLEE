"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference at $11,000?  That still leaves you a significant profit and it's closer to my asking price.

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,875.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He can get the product for $10,875, which is a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  While he could potentially try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice is firm at this point.  Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing it altogether."
