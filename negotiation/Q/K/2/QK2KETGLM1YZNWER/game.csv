"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. What are your thoughts?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me.  This item would be very valuable to me around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, $11,000 is still a bit much for my budget. Would you consider $9,500?  That's a fair offer that would allow me to make this purchase.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
