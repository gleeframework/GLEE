Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000, and we have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  It's better to secure the product at a good price than risk not getting it at all."
