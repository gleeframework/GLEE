"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $80. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? This would be a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $97.50 as a compromise. This would allow us to stay closer to my budget while still respecting the value of the product.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $100, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's seal the deal and both walk away happy!",100.0,Alice,5,
