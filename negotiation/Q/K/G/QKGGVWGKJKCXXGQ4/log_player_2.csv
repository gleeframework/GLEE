"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  It's way above your maximum price of $100. It's better to counteroffer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $90 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $100 to me and $120 to her. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go higher than $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Alice's offer is still too high. It's better to buy the product from John for $100. This guarantees I get the product at my maximum price, and avoids any further negotiation."
