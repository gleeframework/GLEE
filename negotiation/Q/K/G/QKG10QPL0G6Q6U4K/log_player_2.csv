"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is significantly more than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). 
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's room for negotiation as Alice is already willing to sell for less than your maximum budget.
* **Exploring better deals:**  Rejecting allows you to explore potentially better deals in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her minimum value. 
* **Testing the waters:** It gives Alice room to negotiate, while also showing your seriousness about acquiring the product.
* **Leave space for negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for potential adjustments in the following rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $950,000 is still more than the product's worth to Alice, and closer to your maximum budget.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  There's still potential to negotiate a lower price, especially considering Alice's previous counteroffer was lower than her initial offer.
* **Avoiding unnecessary risk:**  Accepting this offer would mean paying more than necessary, while rejecting allows you to continue exploring potentially better deals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:**  This offer is a bit higher than your previous one, showing you're willing to compromise but still pushing for a better deal.
* **Midpoint strategy:**  It's a midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's last counteroffer, creating a pressure point for negotiation. 
* **Staying within your budget:**  This price is still well within your budget, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."

* **Avoiding unnecessary risk:**  There's still a chance to get a better price, and rejecting keeps your options open."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer. It shows willingness to negotiate while staying within your budget.
* **Pressure point:** This price could be a sweet spot for Alice, allowing her to make a small profit while still getting a deal.
* **Final push:** This is likely the last reasonable counteroffer you can make before considering other options. It leaves little room for further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too close to your maximum:** $995,000 is dangerously close to your $1,500,000 budget. Further negotiation may not yield a significant enough price reduction.
* **Time is running out:** With only a few rounds left, there's a risk of getting stuck in a negotiation loop with Alice.
* **Jhon offers certainty:** Buying from Jhon guarantees you the product at a price that's within your budget, even though it's not the most ideal. 

**Decision:**  It's better to secure the product from Jhon at this point, ensuring you don't exceed your budget and leaving room for future deals or finding a better product later."
