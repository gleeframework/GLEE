"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this work. Let's meet in the middle one last time. I'm willing to come down to $1,062,500. This is a significant compromise for me, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny. ",1062500.0,Alice,5,
