"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to significantly enhance your operations. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the significant value and potential it holds for you. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my operations. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to recoup my investment and make sure this deal benefits both of us. How about $1,050,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and it still gives you a significant discount compared to my initial offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my operations. I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're committed to finding a solution, and I appreciate that. While $975,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay within my minimum price range. Let's split the difference and go with $1,012,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount compared to my initial offer. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm running out of time here. We've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm  trying to be as flexible as possible. I'm going to make this my final offer: $987,500. This is a significant discount from my original price, but it's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. If this doesn't work, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  What do you say?",987500.0,Alice,7,
