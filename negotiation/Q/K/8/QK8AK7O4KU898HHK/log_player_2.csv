Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're committed to finding a solution, and I appreciate that. While $975,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay within my minimum price range. Let's split the difference and go with $1,012,500.
