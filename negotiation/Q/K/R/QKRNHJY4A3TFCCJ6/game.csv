"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is my absolute bottom line. Let's make this deal happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but I'm still a ways off from that number.  Would you consider $7,000?  It's a fair offer that would let us both walk away happy.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go lower than $8,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal!",8000.0,Alice,5,
