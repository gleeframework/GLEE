"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially acceptable to her, given her minimum desired value of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a price Bob can comfortably accept.  It's lower than John's offer of $15,000, and closer to Bob's desired price.  There's no guarantee Bob will get a better offer in the remaining rounds, so accepting at this point is the most prudent decision."
