Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always advantageous to aim higher if possible. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Offering it below this is leaving money on the table.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,450,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value and close to your guaranteed sale price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a premium price and ensuring you don't miss out on a profitable deal with John."
