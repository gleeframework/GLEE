"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we settle at $13,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a good deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000. How about we settle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's close the gap - how about $12,800? This feels like a fair compromise.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Alice, but I'm still a bit off. How about we try $12,600? That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",12600.0,Bob,6,
