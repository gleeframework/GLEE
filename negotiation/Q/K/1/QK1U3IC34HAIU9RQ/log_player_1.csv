"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we settle at $13,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000. How about we settle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, Alice, but I'm still a bit off. How about we try $12,600? That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While I'd like to push for more, Bob has presented a ""final offer"" and seems ready to walk away. $12,600 is a significant profit margin above my minimum ($8,000), and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of losing him as a buyer altogether. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting nothing."
