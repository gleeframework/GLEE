Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $750,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to meet my minimum threshold. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $780,000. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $815,000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While still above our ideal price, Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. Accepting at $815,000 secures the product at a price well below John's $1,200,000."
