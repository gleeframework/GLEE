"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,075,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and Alice's offer is closer to his desired range, but he can likely get it even lower.  Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,050,000, which is $1,062,500. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At this point, the difference between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price is small. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that is significantly lower than John's offer and is within his budget. Further negotiation could result in a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John increases.  It's a calculated risk to accept the offer at this point."
