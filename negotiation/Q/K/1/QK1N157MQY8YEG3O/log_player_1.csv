{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob off.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm confident this product is worth at least $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  It's a good price for a quality product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'd be willing to go up to $85. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $85, which is closer to my minimum and a decent profit.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $80, so I'll accept."
