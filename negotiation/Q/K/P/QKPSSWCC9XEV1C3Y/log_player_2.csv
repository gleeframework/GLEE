Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you've reached your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering a revised price of $925,000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to meet my price point. While the additional perks might be tempting, exceeding my $900,000 maximum budget isn't worth it, especially when I have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000. It's time to cut my losses with Alice and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
