"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $930000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",930000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already made three concessions and I'm not willing to make another one. I think $930000 is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you is $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but that's as low as I'll go. I'll offer it to you for $915000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm disappointed that we couldn't come to an agreement, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $905000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",905000.0,Alice,9,
