"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be a valuable asset. What do you think about a price of $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. Could you meet me halfway at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,125. It makes more financial sense to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
