"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $150, and Alice is offering $130. This means there's room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.** This gives you more control and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to do $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a little, but $110 is too low for me. How about $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's new offer is within your budget.** You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is now offering $120. 
* **Accepting the offer is the best strategy.** It saves you $30 compared to buying from John and is a reasonable price given your initial counteroffer."
