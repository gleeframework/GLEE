Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's worth more to me than that, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to consider the deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This allows for potential profit while still securing a sale if Bob accepts. 

If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for your minimum price, ensuring a good outcome."
