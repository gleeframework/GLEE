"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to consider the product's true value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $820000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's uniqueness and the benefits it can bring to your business and personal life. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to pay $750000 for the product, which is a fair price given its potential value. I'm confident this offer reflects a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to reduce the price to $790000, which is still a significant discount from the original offer. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price, considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",790000.0,Alice,5,
