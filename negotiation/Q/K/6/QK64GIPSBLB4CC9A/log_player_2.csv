"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000.  This would still give you a significant profit and is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $1,350,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000.
* **It's a good deal compared to John:**  Buying from Alice saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield much more:**  Alice has already moved down from her initial offer, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small compared to the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
