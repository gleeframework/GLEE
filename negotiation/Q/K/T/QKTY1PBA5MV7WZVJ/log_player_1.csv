I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's worth to Bob but leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is at my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."

Bob seems determined to get the product for his minimum price. I've already made a significant concession and am not sure if further negotiation will get me a better price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
