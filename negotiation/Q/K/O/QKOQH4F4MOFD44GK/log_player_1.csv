I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always lower the price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
