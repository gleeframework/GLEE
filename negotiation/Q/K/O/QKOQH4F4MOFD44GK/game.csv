"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $11500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12250?  I think this would be a good deal for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12250 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $11750.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",11750.0,Bob,6,
