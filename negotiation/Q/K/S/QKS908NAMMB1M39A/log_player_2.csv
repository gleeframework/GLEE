"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a lower offer than what you're ultimately willing to pay. This gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Significant Difference:** Offering $6,000 creates a significant gap between your offer and Alice's asking price. This might encourage her to come down considerably in her counter-offer.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the backup option of buying from John for $8,000.  This gives you leverage, as you don't *have* to reach an agreement with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $8,500 is still more than your $8,000 budget and your alternative option with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to meet closer to your desired price point. 
* **Leverage:** You still have the option of buying from John, so you don't have to feel pressured to accept a price you're not comfortable with."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering I could buy it elsewhere for $8,000."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer moves closer to Alice's price while still staying under your maximum budget.
* **Transparency and Leverage:** You're being transparent about your alternative option with John,  showing Alice you're serious and have other options. This could encourage her to accept your offer or counter with a price closer to your target.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer gauges Alice's willingness to negotiate further. Her response will give you a better understanding of how low she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,000, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering you can buy it elsewhere for $8,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Margin:** While $7,500 is closer to your goal, it's only a $500 difference from buying from John. It's worth seeing if Alice will go lower.
* **Potential for Agreement:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has come down significantly from her original price. There's still a chance to reach an agreement closer to your target. 
* **Limited Risk:** If Alice won't budge further, you can always fall back on your agreement with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,250.  That's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 7250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering $7,250 is directly in the middle of the current negotiating gap between your last offer ($7,000) and Alice's counteroffer ($7,500). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Final Offer Implication:**  The phrasing ""I'm willing to meet you halfway..."" suggests this is your best offer, creating a sense of urgency for Alice to accept.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Option:**  You're still below your budget and the price John offers, preserving your leverage in the negotiation."
