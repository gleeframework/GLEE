"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000.  This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his budget might be.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is too low for me.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle.  I still have the option to sell to John if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I want to show flexibility but also maintain a price that reflects the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more. $9,000 is closer to my minimum but I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John if this negotiation fails, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to drop my price a little more to $11,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a sign of good faith and that we're getting closer to a deal.  If he rejects this, I might be more willing to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure if he's willing to go higher.  To avoid the risk of further rounds of negotiation and potentially losing the deal, I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John."
