"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I recognize its value, $10,500 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'll counter with an offer of $9,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm still confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal, but $9,800 is just a touch too high for me.  My final offer is $9,500.  If this works, we have an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll counter with an offer of $9,700. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9700.0,Alice,7,
