"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to me is much higher. I'm confident this price represents a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $900,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This price aligns better with what I am able to spend while still allowing me to acquire the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet. Given the unique value of this product, I can come down to $875,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering your budget constraints.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

I hope this proposal is closer to what you're comfortable with and we can find a solution that works for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,
