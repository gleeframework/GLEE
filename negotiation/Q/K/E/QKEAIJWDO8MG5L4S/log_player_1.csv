Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to me is much higher. I'm confident this price represents a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, leaving some room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding Bob's perceived value.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's true value to me, implying that this price is a concession on my part.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I frame the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for further discussion, indicating I'm willing to negotiate.

This approach aims to secure a price closer to my desired $1,000,000 while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $900,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This price aligns better with what I am able to spend while still allowing me to acquire the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my desired $1,000,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $900,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can likely secure a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, I'm willing to take a calculated risk with Bob in hopes of achieving a price closer to that.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to potentially achieve a more favorable outcome through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet. Given the unique value of this product, I can come down to $875,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering your budget constraints.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate the importance of finding a solution that benefits both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's value by emphasizing my own compromise.
* **Openness to Agreement:**  The message encourages Bob to consider the offer and reach an agreement. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is more appealing to Bob while still maintaining a price closer to my desired goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I understand the value you place on this product, and I respect your position. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860,000. This price is closer to what I am able to spend while still allowing me to acquire the product. I hope this proposal is closer to what you're comfortable with and we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Negotiating Room:** Bob's counteroffer of $860,000 is only $10,000 higher than his initial offer.  Further negotiation might not yield a significant increase in price.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks extending the process and potentially missing out on the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John.
* **Acceptable Compromise:** While $1,000,000 is my ideal, $860,000 is still a decent price considering Bob's initial perceived value of $800,000.

Selling to John at this point is the most prudent decision. It guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to significantly raise his offer."
