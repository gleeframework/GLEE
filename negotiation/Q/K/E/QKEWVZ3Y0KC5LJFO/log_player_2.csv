"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $11,500. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than John's price of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer and potentially secure an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still think the product is worth a premium. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's better than John's price of $12,000 and closer to Bob's ideal price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject the counteroffer again, forcing Bob to pay John's higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without taking unnecessary risks."
