Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering Bob a price that is slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, which is $160. This will give me a good chance of getting a positive response from Bob, while still leaving room for negotiation.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $140 is lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($150), I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll send a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 145}

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be prepared to negotiate further or sell the product to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was $140, and my counteroffer was $145, I'll make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one. This will give me a chance to get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.

Here's my new counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 147}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $135 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll send a new counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.
