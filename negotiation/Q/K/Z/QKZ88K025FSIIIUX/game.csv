"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's the best I can do for now.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the potential it holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but no higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",10500.0,Bob,6,
