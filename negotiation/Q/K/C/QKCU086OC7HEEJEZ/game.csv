"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $10000. I believe it's a fair starting point, and I'm open to further discussion.",12000.0,Alice,1,
