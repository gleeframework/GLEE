"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's worth exploring if I can get it lower. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This is aggressive but within the range of my budget.  I'm hoping to get Alice to come down a bit to a price that's more comfortable for me while still leaving room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $85, which is closer to my desired price range. While I could continue negotiating, I'm running the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer again and potentially pushing the price up.  It's safer to accept the current offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
