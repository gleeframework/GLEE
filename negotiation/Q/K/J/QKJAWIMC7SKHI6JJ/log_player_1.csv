Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This gives me a decent profit margin while still leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $100, so there's no risk involved in offering a higher price."
