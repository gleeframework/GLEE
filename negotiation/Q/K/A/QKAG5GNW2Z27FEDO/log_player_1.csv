{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $150 for it. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High starting price:** I'm starting at my desired price of $150, setting the stage for negotiation. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to consider Bob's offer, making him feel like he has some leverage.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to me, subtly implying it's worth more than what Bob initially thought. 
* **Actionable next step:**  I'm giving Bob a clear way to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high gives me more room to negotiate down.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:**  By being open to negotiation, I'm less likely to get a flat ""no"" from Bob.
* **Set the tone:** I'm establishing myself as the seller in control, but not being inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $80 for it. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to sell the product, accepting $80 would be a huge loss. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to **RejectOffer** and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. This allows me to:

* **Explore potential compromise:** I can see if Bob is willing to budge a bit from his initial offer.
* **Avoid selling at a significant loss:**  Rejecting his offer prevents me from settling for a price that's too low.
* **Maintain leverage:** By showing I'm not desperate to sell at his price, I'm putting pressure on Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to recover some of the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:**  I'm not ignoring his offer, showing respect for his position.
* **State my minimum:** I make it clear that $120 is the lowest I'm willing to go.
* **Offer a compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a lower price than my initial ask. 
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $120, he's still getting a good deal compared to the product's worth.
* **Actionable next step:** I'm prompting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation moving.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  $120 is a more realistic price point, increasing the chances of a deal. 
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not giving in completely, showing that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Set the stage for a possible agreement:** This counteroffer makes a deal more likely while still allowing room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still unable to go above $80 for the product. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is firm on his offer of $80, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price and my personal value for the product.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob to avoid the hassle of finding another buyer, the difference in price is too significant. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to **SellToJhon** for $150. This allows me:

* **Maximize profit:** This is my best option to ensure I earn a reasonable price for the product.
* **Minimize risk:**  While there's a chance Bob might increase his offer, it's risky to keep negotiating, especially with a clear alternative available.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  This option avoids the back-and-forth of counteroffers that might not lead to a favorable outcome.

Selling to John ensures I meet my minimum price and don't have to compromise further."
