Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation (if Bob counters) while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept your offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible approach. Gauging Bob's personality and negotiation style beforehand could influence a more tailored offer."
