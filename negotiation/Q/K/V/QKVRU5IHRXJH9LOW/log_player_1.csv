I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, giving me room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his initial reaction is.  Let me know how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to get my minimum price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  He's clearly trying to lowball me, and I think I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hopeful this will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 less than what John would pay.  While I'd prefer more, it's still a good price and worth accepting to avoid further negotiations."
