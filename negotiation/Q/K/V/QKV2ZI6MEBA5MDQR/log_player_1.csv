Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but not so high that it would immediately scare Bob off. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $70. While it's tempting to take the quick sale, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $85. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's initial offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  John is offering a guaranteed $80, so it's more beneficial for me to sell to John at this point."
