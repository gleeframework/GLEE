"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is considerably below its true value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
