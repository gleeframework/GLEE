Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($100) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer allows you to see how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer, ensuring you won't be forced to go below your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to his perceived value, it's still above your minimum. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you a chance to potentially secure a higher price. You can now propose a counteroffer that bridges the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Meeting in the middle at $135 shows a willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both parties. 
* **Maintain Profit:** This price point still keeps you well above your minimum of $100 and aims for a higher profit margin than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Continued Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the door open for further discussion if Bob isn't satisfied, while still pushing for a price closer to your initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $125 is a reasonable compromise. It gives you a $25 profit, which is a good outcome.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's no guarantee. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forth.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While John offers a guaranteed $100, accepting Bob's offer results in a better return."
