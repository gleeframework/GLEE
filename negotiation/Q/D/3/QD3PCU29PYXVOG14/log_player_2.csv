"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident will bring a lot of value to your life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth is significantly higher than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm not interested in paying $12,000. The product is too expensive for me. I'll reject Alice's offer.
