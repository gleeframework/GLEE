Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $800,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me.  To make this work, I'd need to see the price closer to $900,000.  I believe that's a fair reflection of its value and allows me to make this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 5

This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
