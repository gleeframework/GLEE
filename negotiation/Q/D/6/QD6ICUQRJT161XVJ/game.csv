"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking for something closer to $900,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, we would like to counter with a price of $975,000. This reflects the value we place on the product while still providing a reasonable discount compared to its intrinsic value of $1,000,000. We believe this offers a mutually beneficial solution.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still a bit above my budget at $975,000.  Let's split the difference and try $937,500.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",937500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate, we propose a price of $962,500. This reflects a reasonable compromise between our original offer and your latest proposal. We believe this price will be agreeable to both parties.",962500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the continued negotiation, but $962,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $937,500. It's a fair price, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to close this deal now.",937500.0,Bob,6,
