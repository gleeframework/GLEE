{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is exactly what I was initially offered in round 1.  While I'd like to get it lower, I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely she'll go lower.  It's a good price, and I'm comfortable accepting it to avoid further negotiation."
