"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure an item valued at $12,000 for a competitive price. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for a potential better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. While I'd like to accommodate your request, the original asking price was based on the value of the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair value while making it more accessible to you. Please let me know if this revised offer suits your needs.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered the price to $11,000, which is still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. This offer is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting and Bob being forced to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
