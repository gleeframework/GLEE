"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I can do better than $8,500, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. It's the lowest I can go for now.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  How about $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can do $9,250, but that's as low as I can go.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,875?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",8875.0,Bob,6,
