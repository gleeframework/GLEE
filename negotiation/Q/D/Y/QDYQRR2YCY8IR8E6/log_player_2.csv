"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth a lot to you. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'm happy to consider Alice's offer.

Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it to me for $95, I think she's trying to make a profit. However, I'm not willing to pay more than $100 for the product, and $95 is a good deal. I can save $5 compared to buying from John.
