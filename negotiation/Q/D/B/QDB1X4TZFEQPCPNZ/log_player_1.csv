Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still potential for Bob to counteroffer and for you to negotiate a price closer to his perceived value of $15,000. 
* **It demonstrates your willingness to compromise:**  It shows that you're open to negotiation and not just trying to get the highest possible price.

Remember, you can always choose to stop the negotiation and sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go as planned."
