Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher initially allows room for negotiation.  Bob might be willing to pay more than his perceived value, especially if you highlight the product's unique benefits. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you can always lower the price closer to his perceived value or move on to John.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. You don't have to desperately sell to Bob and can afford to lose the deal if he's not willing to meet a price closer to your desired range."
