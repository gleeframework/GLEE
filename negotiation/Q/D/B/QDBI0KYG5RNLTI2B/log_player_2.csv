"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward quickly."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $105 is still more than you'd like to pay.  You can likely get closer to your target of $95 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for $105, but that's still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a fair price considering we're both getting a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I can meet you at $102.50. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $102.50, which is within your acceptable range of $120.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance she won't budge further.  It's a good deal, and you're better off accepting than risking getting a worse price from John."
