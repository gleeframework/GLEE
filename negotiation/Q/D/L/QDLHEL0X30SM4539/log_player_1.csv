Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Aiming for a price close to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Consider the Alternative:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is the fallback, so any offer accepted above this is a win."
