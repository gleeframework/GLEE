"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm afraid $800000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not convinced that $835000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target price.

"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I'm not willing to budge from my previous offer of $845000. I'm confident that's the best price for this product, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at $845000, I'm afraid we've reached an impasse.",845000.0,Alice,9,
