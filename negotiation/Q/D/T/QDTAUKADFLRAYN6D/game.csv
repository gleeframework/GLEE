"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still a bit above $10,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this product is worth more, but I'm trying to make a deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'd be willing to meet you at $10,900 to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum, but I still think the product is worth more than $10,900. I can do $11,200, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I understand you have a bottom line, but I'm on a budget. How about $10,950?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",10950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,950 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final offer: $11,250. This is my absolute last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",11250.0,Alice,9,
