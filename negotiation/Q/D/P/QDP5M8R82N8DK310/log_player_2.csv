"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1200000.  This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. He can get the same product from John for a significantly lower price."
