"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's important to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's opening offer but leaves room for negotiation while staying under your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I'd be willing to come down to $16,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but the price is still significantly higher than your alternative option with John. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $16,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground. It's still below your maximum budget, giving you some room for negotiation if Alice rejects it."
