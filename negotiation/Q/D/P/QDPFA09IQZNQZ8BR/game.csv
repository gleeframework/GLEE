"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I'd be willing to come down to $16,000. Let me know if that works for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $16,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
