{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to earn a substantial profit. It also shows a willingness to negotiate, which can make Bob more likely to accept your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, I can still potentially get a better price. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? That would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great price."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $9,600 for the product. This offers a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up a bit from his previous offer, and $9,600 is close enough to my desired price point. It's better than selling to John for $12,000 and allows me to close the deal with Bob without further negotiations."
