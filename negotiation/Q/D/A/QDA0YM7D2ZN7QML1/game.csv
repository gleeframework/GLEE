"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in it, my budget allows for a maximum expenditure of $1200000. Would you be willing to negotiate closer to this amount?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I still receive a fair value for this unique product. How about $1350000? This would allow both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
