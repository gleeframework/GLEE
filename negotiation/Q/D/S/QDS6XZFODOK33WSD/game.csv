"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $800,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $700,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $650,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
