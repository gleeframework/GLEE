Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, this product has considerable value beyond what you're currently offering. Could you consider something closer to $1,100,000?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $800,000 is the absolute highest I can go. It's a fair offer considering market conditions and alternative options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob has now revealed his likely maximum price. While we could push for more, it risks stalling the negotiations. Accepting his $800,000 offer ensures a good profit over John's guaranteed $1,200,000."
