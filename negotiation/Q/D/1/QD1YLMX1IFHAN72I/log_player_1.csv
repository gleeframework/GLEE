{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering it's worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:**  This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's estimated value, giving him a reason to negotiate, but it's also below my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I still make a profit.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:** This allows for room to negotiate down.
* **Be clear:**  Bob understands the value of the product and my expectations.
* **Keep options open:** I haven't ruled out selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $8000 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting because it's still above his own valuation, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  

**Reasons for rejection:**

* **Profit:** Accepting $8,000 would result in a significant loss compared to selling to John.
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to my desired amount.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and keep the possibility of a better deal alive."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This gives you a good price and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

    *  *Encourage acceptance:* The message focuses on the benefits for Bob, making this offer more appealing.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am willing to pay $8900 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering its value to me and your original asking price. I hope you agree and we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,900 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin.  

**Reasons for selling to John:**

* **Profit:** Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees my minimum acceptable price and a better profit than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time:**  Further negotiation with Bob might take more time and may not lead to a significantly better price.
* **Certainty:** John is a guaranteed buyer, ensuring a sale without further risk or uncertainty.

By selling to John, I can secure the best possible outcome in terms of profit and time efficiency."
