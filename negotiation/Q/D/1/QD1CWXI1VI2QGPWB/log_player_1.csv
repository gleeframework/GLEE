Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is well above your minimum price of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $120 is significantly less than the $150 Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially go higher if Bob is willing to pay more, but you've also established a firm starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent profit, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $110, which still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. Could you consider $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $105 is a reasonable compromise.  It's still above my minimum and ensures I make a good profit. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
