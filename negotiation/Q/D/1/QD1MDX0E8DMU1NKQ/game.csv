"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to its true worth for me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. This allows me to acquire the product while still saving a significant amount of money. I look forward to your response.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? It's still a significant savings for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
