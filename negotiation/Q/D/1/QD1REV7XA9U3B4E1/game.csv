"Bob, I have a unique product I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your confidence in its potential value. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose an offer closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is $1400000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. While $1400000 is closer to what I'm seeking, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1450000, but I need to stay above that number to make this worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
