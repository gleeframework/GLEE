"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $100. I really like the product and would like to make a deal. Can you consider my offer?",100.0,Bob,4,
