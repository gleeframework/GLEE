"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He's better off rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer yet.  He can continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, and he has a guaranteed alternative: buying from John for $8,000. 

While Alice has come down to $10,500, this is still more than Bob's maximum.  There's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a lower price, and it's possible Alice will counter with a price even higher than $10,500.  It's more sensible for Bob to take the guaranteed lower price from John and avoid further risk."
