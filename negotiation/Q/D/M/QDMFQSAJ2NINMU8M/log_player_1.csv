"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a 20% markup on the product's value to Bob. I'm hoping to get close to this price, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price point of $10,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's initial offer.  Hopefully, this will be a more appealing price for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him further.  I'm mindful of John's offer of $10,000, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob if I can."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to offer $10,500. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my last offer and Bob's. Hopefully, this will be a sweet spot that he finds acceptable.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I'm hoping to secure a slightly better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum price point.  It's a fair deal for both of us.  I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal.  There's no need to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate, especially with John's offer on the table."
