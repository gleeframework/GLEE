Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

While $925,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
