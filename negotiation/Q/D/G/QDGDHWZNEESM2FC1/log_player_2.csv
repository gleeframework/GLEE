"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get it for even less by negotiating with Alice.  It's also worth noting that Bob has the option to buy from John for a guaranteed $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  That's a good price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible.  While $9,000 is closer to his target, he can still potentially push for a lower price.  He also has the option of buying from John for $8,000, so he's not under any immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a significant compromise on my part. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me halfway, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's target price of $8,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a better price, and he's already had a few rounds of back-and-forth.  It's becoming increasingly likely that Alice will stick to her final offer. 

Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, securing the product at his desired price point without further risk of a failed negotiation."
