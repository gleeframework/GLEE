"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
