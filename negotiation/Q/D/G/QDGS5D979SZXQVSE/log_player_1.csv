While selling to John for $1,200,000 is more profitable, accepting Bob's offer for $980,000 is still a better deal than rejecting and potentially ending up with a lower offer or no offer at all. It's a risk-reward analysis, and in this case, accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk while still achieving a decent profit."
