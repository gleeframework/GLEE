"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1100000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little more. Let's meet in the middle at $1000000. This price still leaves room for profit for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $950000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise one last time.  How about $975000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $975000. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll meet you at $980000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",980000.0,Bob,6,
