"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might be considered reasonable in the first round. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Confidence:**  The message expresses confidence in the product's value and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** 
* **There's potential for negotiation:**  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is a backup option:**  While selling to John is tempting, I'd prefer to try and get a better price from Bob if possible, as there are still rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight the value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message aims to keep the negotiation open and positive, increasing the chances of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $15,200 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** This is a good deal for me, and I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Selling to John is a safe alternative:** While selling to John is tempting, Bob's offer is slightly better. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting this offer reduces the risk of the negotiations breaking down completely. It's unlikely I'll get a higher price in the remaining rounds."
