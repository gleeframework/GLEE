"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a profit. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $1,350,000? This would still allow you a decent profit, and it's closer to what I need to make on this sale. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,325,000? This would still provide a reasonable profit for you while keeping my costs within my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
