"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a price that reflects its value to both of us. I'm asking for $1,400,000. This price acknowledges the value you'll get from it, while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,300,000 is a bit too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to see a price closer to $1,400,000 to make this work for me. Let's try $1,350,000. This compromise allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting close. While I appreciate your counteroffer, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. I'll accept $1,340,000, but this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
