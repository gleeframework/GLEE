Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob. $1,300,000 is too low, but I still want to avoid selling to John at this point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,300,000 is a bit too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to see a price closer to $1,400,000 to make this work for me. Let's try $1,350,000. This compromise allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. While I'm running out of time, I'm going to counter with one last offer before considering John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. While I appreciate your counteroffer, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. I'll accept $1,340,000, but this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll be moving on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1340000}

It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation and we are running out of time.  While I would prefer a higher price, selling to John will guarantee my desired minimum return and avoid risking losing the deal completely."
