{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and build rapport with Bob to encourage a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $90 is a good price, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I think that's a fair compromise considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $85 is a higher price than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm confident I can get a better deal with John."
