Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a lower price from Alice. There are still 7 rounds left, giving me more opportunities to bargain."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  We are now at the midpoint of the negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a lower price.  I'll continue to try to negotiate a better deal."

I'm also acknowledging that the price might need to be a little higher than my initial offer. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I'm hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds."
