"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I can get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is still within my budget of $1,200,000. Rejecting Alice's offer will allow me to save $300,000.
