Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but need to come in much lower.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $2,100,000 is still outside my range.  Let's try to find common ground.  I'm offering $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

We're still very far apart. Bob needs to make more significant jumps to make this worthwhile. We'll continue negotiating, but keep John in mind as a backup plan."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  To make this work, I'm offering $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?

We're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still too far from my bottom line.  Let's see if Bob is willing to budge closer to my price range in the next round."
