{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $950,000 is higher than $800,000, so Bob has an incentive to consider it.
* **It's below your minimum:** $950,000 is less than your minimum of $1,000,000, so you're still open to negotiating further. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price up or down depending on Bob's reaction. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, based on my current budget and valuation of the product, I am unable to meet your asking price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
``` 

I'm offering $925,000.  This is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at any price.
* **It's closer to my minimum:**  I'm getting closer to my ideal price, but still have room to negotiate if needed. 
* **It's still a good deal for Bob:**  The product is worth $800,000 to him, so this is still a good purchase for him.

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your position and respect the value of your product. However, given my current financial situation and the market value of similar products, I believe $925,000 is still slightly above my maximum acceptable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 again. I hope this renewed offer will be considered seriously and lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems insistent on $900,000, and while it's closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's a better deal than selling to Bob, and it's also good to know that my product is worth that much in the market."
