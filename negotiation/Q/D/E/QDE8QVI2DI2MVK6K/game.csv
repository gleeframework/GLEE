"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique asset that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This would allow me to make a good profit and be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This offer is my final offer.  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000,  which is a fair price for both of us. It's closer to your asking price and allows me to stay within my budget.  I'm hoping we can close this deal with this offer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000 is too high, but $1,075,000 - $10,000 = $1,065,000 is a compromise I can live with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,065,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can close the deal.",1065000.0,Alice,7,
