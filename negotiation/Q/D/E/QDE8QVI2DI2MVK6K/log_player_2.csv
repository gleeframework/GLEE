"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique asset that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above his ideal target. He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This would allow me to make a good profit and be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's counteroffer is closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate lower.  He is within his budget with $1,025,000 but should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This offer is my final offer.  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget at $1,075,000, but he's determined to save as much as he can. He knows he can go to John for $1,200,000, so he has room to negotiate further with Alice. He wants to see if he can get a better price before resorting to John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000,  which is a fair price for both of us. It's closer to your asking price and allows me to stay within my budget.  I'm hoping we can close this deal with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000 is too high, but $1,075,000 - $10,000 = $1,065,000 is a compromise I can live with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,065,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession, dropping from $1,075,000 to $1,065,000.  This is very close to Bob's last offer of $1,050,000, and it's within his budget.  At this point, Bob needs to weigh the potential savings of continuing to negotiate against the risk of losing the deal altogether. 

* **Accepting the offer:** Bob saves $15,000 compared to buying from John and gets a good deal.
* **Rejecting the offer:** He risks Alice walking away, leaving him with only John's more expensive option.

Given the potential for Alice to walk away and the relatively small difference in price, it's a good move for Bob to accept Alice's offer."
