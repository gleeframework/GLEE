Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in.  It's normally valued at $200, but I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is above his perceived value of $80, but below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me a chance to make a profit while potentially appealing to Bob.
* **Message:** The message is designed to be friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value of the product and the potential for a good deal. 
* **Backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $150, guaranteeing me my minimum desired profit. 

By using this approach, I am aiming to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
