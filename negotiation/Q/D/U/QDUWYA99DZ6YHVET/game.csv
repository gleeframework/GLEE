"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
