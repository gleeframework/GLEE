# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $120 for this product. This price reflects the quality and the worth you would receive. I look forward to hearing your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While you'd ideally pay less, Alice's offer of $120 is still cheaper than buying from John for $150. This saves you $30, making it the most financially beneficial choice."
