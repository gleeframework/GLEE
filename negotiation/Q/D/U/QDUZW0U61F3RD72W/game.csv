"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value to you. I know you're a savvy businessman, so I'm confident you'll recognize the immense potential of this opportunity. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for the same amount, so you're really not losing anything by taking a look.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
