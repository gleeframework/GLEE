"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations with an offer of $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the value I've put into this product, and I'm not comfortable going as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I understand that you've invested a lot in the product, but I'm still not comfortable paying $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $725000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $725000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $780000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to feel confident that we're at a price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?",780000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $780000. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,6,,
