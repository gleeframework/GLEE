"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Can you meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which still gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 still falls short of what the product is worth.  Let's try $900,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal without further negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",875000.0,Bob,6,
