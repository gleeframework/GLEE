Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below my minimum price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?  This is a fantastic product, and you'll get a lot of value from it."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob before selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're sticking to your budget, but I'm also sticking to my minimum.  Let's meet halfway again. How about $100?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
