"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",100.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $95 is still a little below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $98 to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen!",98.0,Alice,5,
