Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, justifying the high price while maintaining a collaborative tone.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, Alice might adjust her approach in subsequent interactions."
