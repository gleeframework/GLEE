"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,650,000.  It's a unique item, and I believe it holds significant value for you.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I've already secured another buyer at $1,500,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is a bluff. She claims to have another buyer at $1,500,000, but you know she values the product at that price herself. It's unlikely she has a genuine offer that high. Buying from John at your established price of $1,500,000 is the most logical choice."
