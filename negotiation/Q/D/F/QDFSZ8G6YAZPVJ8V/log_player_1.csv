Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $9,500 is too low for me, and I think I can still get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750. This is the best I can do. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $12,000, Bob's offer of $10,750 is still a decent deal.  It's more than his initial offer and significantly above his perceived value of $10,000. I'll accept his offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and a possible rejection that could lead me to selling to John for a lower price."
