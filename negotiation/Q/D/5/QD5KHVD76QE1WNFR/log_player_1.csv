"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for negotiation and leaves room for a price that is mutually beneficial.  It's important to remember that I want to maximize my earnings, but I also need to consider Bob's perspective."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $14,000 is closer to my minimum than I would like, and I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a slight concession from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. I want to show I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain a price that's closer to my desired value."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price.  I think there's room for more negotiation and I want to see if I can push for a better deal."

{""product_price"": 14000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price.  This is the point where I need to consider the risk. I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, but I am willing to take a chance with Bob for a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $13,500.  I'm getting close to Bob's price, and it's getting risky to keep going, but I'm still hoping to get a little more.  I think this is a fair compromise point that hopefully will convince Bob to make a deal."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting too risky. I'm very close to my minimum, but I don't want to risk going lower and ending up with a sale below $10,000. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000, which is a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't lose out on too much potential profit."
