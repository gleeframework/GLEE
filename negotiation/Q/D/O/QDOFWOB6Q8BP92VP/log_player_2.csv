"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find valuable. Knowing how much you could benefit from it, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob values the product at $12,000 and Alice's offer is $11,000.  This is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value the product holds for me.  However, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $10,250, which is within Bob's budget of $12,000.**  This is a good deal for Bob, as he's saving $1,750 compared to buying from John.
* **There's no guarantee Bob will get a better price.**  Alice has already moved a bit closer to Bob's desired price, and further negotiation could potentially lead to a stalemate or even a higher price if Alice becomes unwilling to negotiate further. 
* **Accepting the offer secures the product.** Bob is in a strong position to secure the product for a price he's comfortable with.

While there's always the possibility of a slightly lower price, the risk of not getting the product at all or needing to pay John's higher price makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
