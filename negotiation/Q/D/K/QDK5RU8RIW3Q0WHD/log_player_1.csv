Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This would still provide you with a healthy profit margin, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
