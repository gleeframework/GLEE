"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $15,000 for the product, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. You can get the product from John for the same price, eliminating any risk of a longer negotiation."
