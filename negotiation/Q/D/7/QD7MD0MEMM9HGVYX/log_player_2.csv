"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $90. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might encourage her to come back with a lower price closer to her $80 value. If she doesn't, you still have the option to buy from John for $100."
