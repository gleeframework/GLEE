Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a bit high at $1,400,000, and I'd like to negotiate a better price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  How about $1,300,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still within a reasonable range for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$1,250,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and it's getting close to the price John is offering.  I'll accept this offer to close the deal."
