Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $13,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Even though I'm close to my minimum value of $12,000, I don't want to risk a further counteroffer that could drop the price even lower. I'm going to sell to John for $12,000 to guarantee a sale at my minimum price."
