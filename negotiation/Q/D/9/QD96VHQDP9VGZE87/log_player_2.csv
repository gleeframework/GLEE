You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I understand your position, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,500,  which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $12,500. It's a good price compared to John's offer, so it's best to accept and avoid risking losing the deal."
