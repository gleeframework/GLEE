"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $800,000 for it.  This reflects the savings I'm hoping to achieve and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product and I think it's a fair compromise,  given our previous discussions.",850000.0,Bob,4,
