"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to consider a price closer to the middle ground.  I'm offering the product for $9,000.  Let's see if we can make this work!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up with another offer.  I'm still a little hesitant at $8,800. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,200.  This feels like a fair compromise that would be beneficial for both of us. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",8900.0,Bob,6,
