"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity. Our product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $12,000 to you, is now available for purchase. Considering its high value and the benefits it offers, I am extending this offer to you at a special price of $10,000. This is an excellent chance to secure a premium item at a competitive rate. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While her offer is less than your $12,000 maximum, you can likely get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you might:

* Prompt Alice to lower her price further as she wants to make a sale.
*  Stick with buying from John for $12,000 if Alice doesn't budge. 

You're in a good negotiating position because you have a backup option."
