{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to your business."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially reaching a win-win scenario. 
* **Considering the Alternative:** Offering it significantly lower (closer to John's $800,000) leaves a lot of potential profit on the table. 

By starting high and framing the offer strategically, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than her fallback option."
