"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $900,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $800,000? That's a significant investment on my part and meets you closer to your asking price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
