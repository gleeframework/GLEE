Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  This gives you a significant discount and ensures I can still cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
