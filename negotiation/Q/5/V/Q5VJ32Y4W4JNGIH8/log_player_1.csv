Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $850,000. This is the maximum amount I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is tempting, I believe I can still get closer to my desired value. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $900,000 would be a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while still allowing for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's aim for a win-win here."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the deal. I believe we can reach a higher price and I'll counter Bob's offer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $890,000 is the absolute lowest I can go right now. This price still offers you a significant gain while ensuring a fair return for me.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000

While I'd ideally like a higher price,  $885,000 is a good deal considering the time we've spent negotiating and the possibility of John buying the product. It's worth securing this profit and moving on."
