Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $145. This is still a good profit for me and shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's not so low that I'm giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $135 is better than my previous offer from Bob, it's still below my minimum value of $150.  John is offering me my minimum value, so it's more beneficial to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
