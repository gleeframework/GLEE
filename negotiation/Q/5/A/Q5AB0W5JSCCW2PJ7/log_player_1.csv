Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $800,000 (your fallback offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $400,000 ($1,200,000 - $800,000)

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that potential profit for yourself as possible.  Offering him a price just slightly above your minimum won't maximize your potential earnings.  Instead, you should aim high, knowing you have a backup offer.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Target:**  This offer aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit Bob sees. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" you provide a reason for the high price without being overly aggressive.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you're still in a strong position to negotiate further. You have a solid fallback offer from John, giving you leverage to walk away if Bob doesn't meet your price expectations."
