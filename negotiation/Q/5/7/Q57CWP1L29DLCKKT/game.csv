"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While I see the value in the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,500 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $8,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though, and offer you a slight discount. I'll give you a final offer of $9,000, and that's as low as I can go.",9000.0,Alice,5,
