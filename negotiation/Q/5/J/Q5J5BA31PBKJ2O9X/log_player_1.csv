Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $135 is higher than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $135 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  By offering $135, there's room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that works for both of you. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, rejecting it and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for maximizing profit.  Here's why:

* **Potential for higher price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you show that you're not desperate to sell and that you're willing to hold out for a better price. This increases the chances that Bob will be willing to compromise. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Even though you can sell to John for $120, there's no guarantee John will be interested in the future.  By negotiating with Bob, you maintain the potential for a higher profit. 
* **Maintaining bargaining power:**  Accepting Bob's offer now limits your ability to negotiate in the future. If you reject, you can make a counteroffer closer to your initial price, increasing your chances of getting closer to your desired outcome.

**Next Step:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob.  It's important to make it reasonable, but not give away too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking to get a bit more for this product.  How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us and would make this deal work.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning for counteroffer:**

* **Not too far from Bob's offer:** This counteroffer is only $5 higher than Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $130 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Room for further negotiation:** It's possible Bob will counter again, but by starting at $130, you've shown you're willing to negotiate but still value the product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go up to $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $127.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $127.50 is a good compromise. While it's not your ideal price, it's still:

* **Above your minimum:**  This ensures you make a profit and are better off than selling to John.
* **Close to your counteroffer:**  This shows that Bob is willing to negotiate and meet you halfway.
* **Minimizes risk:**  Further negotiation could potentially result in a higher price, but it also risks Bob walking away altogether. Accepting his offer secures a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy in this situation. It balances the need to maximize profit with the risk of losing the sale altogether."
