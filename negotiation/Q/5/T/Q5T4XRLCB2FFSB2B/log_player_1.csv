"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is significantly below my minimum price of $150. I'm not willing to accept that offer. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price to $175. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still firm on getting a fair price. I hope this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum price of $150. While I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair offer, and I'm confident I can find another buyer for this product if I need to. Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
