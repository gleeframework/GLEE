I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a bit above Bob's estimated value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. If he accepts, great! If not, I'm prepared to counter his offer or go with John's guaranteed $12,000."

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm offering $12,500.  It's a bit closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, we can find a middle ground."
