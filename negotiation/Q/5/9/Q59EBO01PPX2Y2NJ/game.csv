"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,250 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll make another counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10750.0,Alice,5,
