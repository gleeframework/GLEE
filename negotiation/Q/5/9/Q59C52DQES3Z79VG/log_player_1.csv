Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage. Starting high allows you to negotiate down if needed, but potentially secure a significantly higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""fair price,"" you subtly anchor Bob's perception to a higher price point than your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?"") signaling willingness to negotiate, which might be necessary with such a high initial offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you prioritize a guaranteed sale over maximizing profit, a lower offer closer to $1,200,000 would be more appropriate."
