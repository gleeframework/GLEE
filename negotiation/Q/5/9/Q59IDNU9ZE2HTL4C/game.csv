,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $125? That gives us both a good deal.",125.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115?,115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $120? That's my absolute minimum.",120.0,Alice,5,
