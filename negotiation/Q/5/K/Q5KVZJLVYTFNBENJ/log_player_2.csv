"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to take advantage of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to work with you, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for some room for us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise and falls within Bob's budget.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal, especially since Bob could always buy from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $25,000 compared to John's price."
