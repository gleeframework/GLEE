"Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but $85 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $105. Is that something you'd be interested in?",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me. How about we settle on $95? That's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm willing to meet you at $97.50. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for a great product.",97.5,Alice,5,,
