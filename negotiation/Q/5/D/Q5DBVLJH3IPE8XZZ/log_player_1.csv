"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, and it also emphasizes the value I place on the product.  I'll see how he reacts before potentially considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept due to the risk of losing the deal, I believe I can negotiate a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for further negotiation while showing that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if we can reach a compromise. I believe there's still potential to get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a compromise, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway. We're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough to convince Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  However, I'm still not quite satisfied with the price.  I'm confident I can get a better price with just a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm countering with $1,450,000.  This is a small concession, showing a willingness to compromise.  I believe this offer is attractive enough to convince Bob to accept, but I'm not willing to go lower at this point.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer in the next round."
