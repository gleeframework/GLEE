Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point, as it's well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm confident that Bob will find this offer attractive given the product's value to him, and it gives me a strong starting position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's value for the product and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $920,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than what I'd get from John, and it's likely that further negotiation with Bob wouldn't lead to a much better outcome."
