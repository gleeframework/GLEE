Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and highlighting the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at the absolute highest price, which allows for potential concessions later on. 
* **Having a Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I have a guaranteed backup if Bob doesn't accept a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **John is a better option:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000.  There's no reason to settle for a lower price when I have a better alternative.
* **Negotiation room:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my desired range.  While there's no guarantee, it's worth exploring further negotiation before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest in the product, $800,000 is simply too far below what I need to sell. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. This gives you a significant discount, and allows me to recover a fair amount. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by offering a price lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  $900,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $800,000.
* **Framing it as a win-win:** I'm emphasizing that the counteroffer benefits both of us.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, so I'm not giving away too much. 
* **Setting a clear next step:** I'm asking Bob for his opinion, making it clear that I'm open to further negotiation."
