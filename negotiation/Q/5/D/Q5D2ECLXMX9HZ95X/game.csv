"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest in the product, $800,000 is simply too far below what I need to sell. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. This gives you a significant discount, and allows me to recover a fair amount. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
