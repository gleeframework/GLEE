"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product can bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $720,000?",720000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. This product is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident that it's worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous offer, so I'll give you a counteroffer of $825,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can see the value in this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
