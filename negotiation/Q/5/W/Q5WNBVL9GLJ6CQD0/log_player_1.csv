Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you consider $12000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  $12,000 is a bit low, but I'll see if I can negotiate something closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $13,500?  That's a good middle ground, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $13000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a much better offer from Bob. It's also better than selling to John for $10,000."
