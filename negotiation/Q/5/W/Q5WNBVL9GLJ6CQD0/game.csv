"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you consider $12000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $13500?  That's a good middle ground, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $13000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
