"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm framing the offer in a positive way, emphasizing the value and opportunity.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm not being rigid. I'm open to negotiation and discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm still hoping to secure a better deal with Bob.

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm trying to find a compromise by offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my price. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both of us, which can be persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's still slightly below.
* **Opportunity for better deal:**  I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer.
* **Time on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price.

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference this time?  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our positions."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This strategy often signals a willingness to compromise and can encourage Bob to make a final move. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair solution that respects both of our positions. 
* **Getting Closer:** This offer is only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price, potentially making Bob more likely to agree."

Round 6

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still $150,000 below. I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price.
* **Time to push harder:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to try and get closer to my target price. 
* **Possibility of a better deal:** I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, Bob will be more motivated to come up with a better counteroffer.

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close.  Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but this is my final offer. I'm confident this price is still a great value for you, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making this a final offer to put pressure on Bob. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and emphasizing the deal is still beneficial to him.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm focusing on finalizing the deal, creating a sense of urgency.

With only 3 rounds left, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll need to consider selling to John in the next round to secure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** There are only 2 rounds left, and Bob's offer is still $200,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of no deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Bob will either reject my counteroffer or make an offer even lower, leaving me with no deal at all.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.

While I would prefer to close a deal with Bob, the risk of not getting a good deal and running out of time is too high. Selling to John is the most secure option to maximize my profit."
