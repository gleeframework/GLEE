"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth a lot more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $725,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet. Let's split the difference one more time - how about $737,500?  That would be a fair compromise and would allow us to both walk away happy.",737500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm not willing to go above $725,000. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, that's my final offer.",725000.0,Bob,6,
