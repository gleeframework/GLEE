"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,900,000.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I've had significant interest from other buyers.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the value it will bring to your business.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,700,000, but that's still a bit higher than my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which I believe reflects the product's value to me and is a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
