Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, knowing it's likely higher than Bob's valuation. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to potentially sway Bob.

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a lower price. I'll also factor in the potential of selling to John for $100 as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed option, I'm still hopeful to get closer to my ideal price with Bob. 
* **Negotiation room:** There's still room for me to counteroffer and potentially get a better price from Bob than $100. 

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $90 and $100. I'll need to consider how much I want to risk losing the deal with Bob vs. getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. It's still a great deal for you, and it helps me get closer to my asking price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $110 to $95, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $95 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I'm not compromising on my bottom line.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting it as a ""great deal"" to entice Bob.

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide whether to accept his next offer (if it's closer to my minimum) or risk selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  I've already lowered my price significantly and Bob is unlikely to budge much further. 
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $100 ensures I make a profit, which is the most important goal in this scenario. 

**Next steps:**

Since I'm choosing to sell to John, the negotiation with Bob ends here."
