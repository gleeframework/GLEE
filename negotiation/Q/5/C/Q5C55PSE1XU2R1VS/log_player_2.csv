"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his ideal value of $10,000 as possible.  Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still above Alice's minimum value. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal value.  While the price is closer to Bob's desired range, it's still not as good as he could potentially get. It makes sense to keep negotiating and see if he can push the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his ideal price while still staying above Alice's minimum value. By increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, Bob shows he's willing to compromise but also wants to make sure he gets a good deal. This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate without forcing Bob to go too far above his ideal value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his ideal value.  There are still rounds available to negotiate, so it's worth pushing for a better price. Bob should continue to try and get Alice closer to his ideal price point before accepting the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money, but realizes the negotiation might be getting tough. He's increasing his offer slightly, acknowledging that Alice might not go lower than $11,000. This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing the offer while still keeping it within his budget and potentially leading to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiation has reached a point where Alice's price is getting close to Bob's maximum budget.  With only a few rounds left, the likelihood of Alice going lower is slim.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $12,000, it's better to cut his losses and avoid risking further negotiation that might not be successful.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product while staying within his budget."
