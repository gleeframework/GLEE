"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for this product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I am confident we can reach an agreement. ",15500.0,Bob,4,
