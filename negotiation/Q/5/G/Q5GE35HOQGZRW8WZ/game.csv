"Alice, $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is only $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $130. How about we try $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be as close to your budget as possible, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $110 is a bit out of my range. Would you consider $95? I'm sure you can still make a profit with that price.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which is $102.50. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $102.50 is still too high.  How about $98? I think that's a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy.",98.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",105.0,Alice,9,
