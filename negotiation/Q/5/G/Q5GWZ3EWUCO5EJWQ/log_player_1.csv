"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $15000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and Bob's offer is the minimum.  I'll try to see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $18,000?  I think this is a fair price for the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $16000, which is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good deal. It's more than what John is offering, and I'm happy to close the deal."
