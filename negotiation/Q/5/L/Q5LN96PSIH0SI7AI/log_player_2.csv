(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are aiming to get the product for less than $150. 
* Alice's initial offer of $120 is too high.
* It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about 110? It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're still aiming for a price below $110. 
* While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above your desired range. 
* There's room to negotiate further, so it's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. Let's split the difference and see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
