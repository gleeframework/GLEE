"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($90) is still more than you want to pay.** You're aiming for a price under $100, but ideally as low as possible.
* **You have a backup option with John.**  While John's price ($100) isn't ideal, it gives you leverage to negotiate with Alice or walk away. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. This might lead Alice to lower her price in a counter-offer, getting you closer to your goal."
