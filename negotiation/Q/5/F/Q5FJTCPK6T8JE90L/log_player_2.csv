"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and it's a fair price considering the value to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product for $1150000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to go with John's offer and save $150,000. You've already tried to negotiate with Alice, and it seems unlikely she'll drop the price further."
