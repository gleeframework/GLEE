"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $950000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the exceptional service and support I'll provide.

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's aim for a price that's closer to its true value. I'm willing to meet you at $940000.
