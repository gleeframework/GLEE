Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal!  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 

This is the initial offer. I'm starting at my desired price point, as it's the highest I'm willing to go without immediately selling to John. This allows for potential negotiation and gives Bob a clear starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $150. I'm willing to counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $140.  This is a significant drop from my initial price, showing flexibility, but it still keeps me above my minimum value. It also gives Bob room to negotiate further if he's still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $130 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value, and further negotiation might not result in a significantly higher price, especially since John is willing to pay $150."
