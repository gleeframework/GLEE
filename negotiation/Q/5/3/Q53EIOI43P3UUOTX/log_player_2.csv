"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a better price.  He can use the knowledge that Alice values the product at $1,200,000 to his advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1300000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000. This allows both of us to gain something from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's ideal price. Accepting the offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John.  While a slightly lower price might be possible, there's no guarantee that Alice would accept further negotiations, potentially leading to a more expensive purchase from John."
