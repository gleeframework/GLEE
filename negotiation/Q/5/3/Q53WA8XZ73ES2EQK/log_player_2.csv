Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, I'm thinking I can get it for a bit lower than that. Let's say I'll offer $1,050,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1087500.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. Since she's still not budging from $1,150,000, I'll try to be more aggressive in my counteroffer. I'll offer $1,075,000, just like last time, but this time I'll add a condition that if she accepts, I'll also get a 2% discount on the total price. I'm hoping this will incentivize her to accept my offer.

{""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'd like to add a condition. If you accept this price, I'd like to get a 2% discount on the total price. This would bring the price down to $1,058,750. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}"

Round 7

I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but I'd like to propose a different condition: I'll throw in a one-year warranty for the product, which is a $50000 value.

I'd like to reject her offer and make another counteroffer. I'll offer $1,025,000, but I'll try to negotiate the warranty separately. I'll offer to pay $25,000 for the warranty, which is half of its value.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. Since she's trying to sell me the warranty separately, I'll try to negotiate the price of the warranty and the product together. I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product and $20,000 for the warranty, which is 40% of its value. I'll also throw in a message to see if I can get her to budge on the product price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer of the one-year warranty, but I'm not sure if it's worth the full $50,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $20,000 for the warranty, which is 40% of its value.
