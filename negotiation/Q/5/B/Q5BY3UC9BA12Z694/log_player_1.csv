Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product for $1,199,999. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe it's worth every penny for the value it brings. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, any price Bob accepts above that is a win.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price very close to John's offer ($1,199,999) sets a high anchor. This makes Bob perceive the offer as potentially more reasonable since it's just slightly below what someone else is willing to pay.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" aim to create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially nudging Bob towards a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a real-world scenario, further back-and-forth negotiation might occur."
