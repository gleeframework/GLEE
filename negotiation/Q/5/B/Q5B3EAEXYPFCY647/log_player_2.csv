"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you have no information about the product's actual value. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to offer you $10,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to that price. "", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good compromise. This price is still within your budget and closer to your desired price point. It's likely you won't be able to negotiate much lower, especially since Alice is willing to meet you halfway. Buying from John for $12,000 would be more expensive, so accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sound decision."
