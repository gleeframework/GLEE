"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening, but it sets a high bar and allows for room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer in the first round, but it will give me valuable information about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I still have plenty of time to negotiate and there's a good chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially since John is offering $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price and closer to the value I believe the product holds.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come up a bit more while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to get more, it's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John or further delay the transaction with more rounds of negotiation.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
