"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $130 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think $135 is the minimum I can go. It's still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $133. It's a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",133.0,Alice,7,

I'm still not comfortable with $133. I'm willing to pay $131 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?,131.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I'm not going to go any lower than $132. That's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll sell you the product. Otherwise, I'm going to have to consider other options.",132.0,Alice,9,

"I'm willing to pay $129 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",129.0,Bob,10,
