"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a special price of $11,500. I think this is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal, you can likely get a better price. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $10,500 for the product? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $11,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than the $12,000 he would pay John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject again and the price could potentially go back up. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure a good deal without risking further negotiation."
