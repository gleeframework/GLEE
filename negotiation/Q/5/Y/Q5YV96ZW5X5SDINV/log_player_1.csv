"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit of acquiring it for your business. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob to pique his interest and justify the price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strong and set the stage for potential compromise in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me, but I do see the value in the product.  How about we start at $650,000 and see where we land? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss for me. I'm rejecting his offer and will proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I see the value of your proposition, I need to stay closer to my asking price.  Let's meet halfway - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but am showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price, demonstrating flexibility. It also positions me closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Focus on fairness:** The message emphasizes a desire for a ""fair deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm encouraging Bob to engage in further discussion and potentially accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer, his offer of $725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's important to remember that I have the option of selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating or secure the guaranteed deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not able to go that low. The product is worth significantly more to me than that, and I need to ensure a fair return on my investment.  Let's split the difference - how about $800,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain a firm stance:** I reiterate the product's worth to me, making it clear I'm not willing to accept a drastically low price.
* **Compromise again:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Focus on fairness:** I continue to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness by suggesting a price that benefits both parties.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation while setting a firm price point."
