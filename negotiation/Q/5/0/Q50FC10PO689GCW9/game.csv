"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a significant profit.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true worth of this product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm committed to purchasing this product, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Let's split the difference and settle at $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I am motivated to find an agreement, I also need to be realistic about the product's value. My final offer is $980,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept.",980000.0,Alice,5,
