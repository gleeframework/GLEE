"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,100,000 is still above his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true worth of this product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum $800,000 limit. He should try to negotiate a lower price again."

This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I am motivated to find an agreement, I also need to be realistic about the product's value. My final offer is $980,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000.  Alice's final offer of $980,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely Alice will drop her price further.  Buying from John guarantees him the product within his budget."
