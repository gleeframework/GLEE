"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer at that price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. That's the absolute maximum I can spend, and I think it's still a good deal for you, especially considering the time we've spent negotiating.",100.0,Bob,6,
