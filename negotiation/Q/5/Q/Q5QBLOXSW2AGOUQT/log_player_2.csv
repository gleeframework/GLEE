"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. How does $120 sound? Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $120 is significantly less than $150.
* **You are still getting a good deal:**  While the product is worth $150 to you, you are getting it for $120, saving $30.
* **Alice is also getting a good deal:** She's selling it for more than her valuation of $80."
