"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get an amazing deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you again, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. How about we try $10,800? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
