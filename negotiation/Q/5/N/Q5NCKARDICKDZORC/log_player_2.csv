Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I can do $127.50, but that's my final offer 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:

While I could counter again, Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  Getting it below $127.50 is unlikely, and at this point, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of her refusing and me having to go with John for $150."
