"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no immediate advantage to buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.  I'm aiming to find a price that's mutually agreeable, and a lower initial counteroffer gives more room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my goal of saving as much money as possible. There are still rounds left to negotiate, and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount.  This counteroffer is a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
