"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is a better deal than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is now $110. This is a better deal than buying from John for $120. 
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or further increase the price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
