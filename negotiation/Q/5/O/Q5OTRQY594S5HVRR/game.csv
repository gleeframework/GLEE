"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my value for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference between our last two offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
