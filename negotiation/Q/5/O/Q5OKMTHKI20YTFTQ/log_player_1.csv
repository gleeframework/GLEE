Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your needs, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  it's worth trying to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a substantial discount from your backup offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your offer."
