"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price of $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
