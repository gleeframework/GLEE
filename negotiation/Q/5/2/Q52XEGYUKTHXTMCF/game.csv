"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you the product for $130. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still not willing to go above $120. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider selling the product to me for $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $115, which would be $122.50. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $122.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $122.50, which would be $121.25. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider selling the product to me for $121.25?",121.25,Bob,6,
