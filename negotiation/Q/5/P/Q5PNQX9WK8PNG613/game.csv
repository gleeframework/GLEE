"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product. However, $900000 is a bit out of my price range right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. This is a fair offer, considering I'm ready to buy it immediately. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your willingness to make a serious offer. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
