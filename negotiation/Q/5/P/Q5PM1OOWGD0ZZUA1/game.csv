"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, $750,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you be open to $675,000?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $725,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",725000.0,Alice,5,
