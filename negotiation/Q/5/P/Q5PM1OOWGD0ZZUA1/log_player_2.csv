Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $725,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

Alice is clearly unwilling to go much lower, and while we could try to negotiate further, $725,000 is a reasonable price that falls within our budget. It's better to secure the deal now than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to pay John's higher price."
