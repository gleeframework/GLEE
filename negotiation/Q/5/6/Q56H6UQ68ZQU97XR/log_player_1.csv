Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to be positive and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a good investment.

I'm ready to negotiate if Bob rejects my initial offer, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $80 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's potential to get closer to my initial asking price. By rejecting his offer, I can initiate a counteroffer and attempt to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is a little too low for me. How about $90? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the value. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering $90, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80. 
* **Positive message:** I'm remaining positive and enthusiastic to keep the negotiation friendly.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price.

By proposing $90, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, especially considering that I can always sell to John for $80 if this deal falls through. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle with John at a lower price isn't worth it."
