Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $140.  I know you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net at $100.

By offering the product at $140, you're aiming to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($50) between what Bob is willing to pay and your minimum price. This leaves Bob with a small gain ($10) and maximizes your potential profit."
