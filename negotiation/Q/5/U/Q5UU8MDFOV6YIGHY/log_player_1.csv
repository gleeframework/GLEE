{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation, but is closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $82 is only slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, I think I can still get a better deal. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $87. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price considering Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price, but I don't see much room for him to go higher.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $80."
