{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate, but it's also below my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows for a potential win-win scenario while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,800. This seems to be a fair compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to $13,000."
