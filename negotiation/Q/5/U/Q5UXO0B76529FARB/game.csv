"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,125,000.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,125,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1,687,500?",1687500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. That's definitely closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,406,250?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",1406250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  Let's expedite the process. I'm willing to come down to $1,546,875.  This is my final offer, as I believe it fairly represents the value of the product.",1546875.0,Alice,5,
