"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this work. This is a significant discount for you and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While I understand $9,500 is still within your budget, it's simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This price is fair for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
