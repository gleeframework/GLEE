"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a good price for you, but I still think the product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $13000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
