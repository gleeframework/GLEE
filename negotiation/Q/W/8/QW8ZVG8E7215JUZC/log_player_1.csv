Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which reflects the significant value you'll gain. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is lower than what you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm aiming for a higher price and will try to negotiate with Bob further. Selling to John is always an option, but I'd like to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $850,000 doesn't reflect the significant value this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This gives you a great deal while still allowing me to make a profit. Let's find common ground and close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to keep pushing for a higher price. $875,000 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can do better if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value our partnership,  $875,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. Let's compromise at $890,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $890,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $880,000 is a good deal considering the potential of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $800,000."
