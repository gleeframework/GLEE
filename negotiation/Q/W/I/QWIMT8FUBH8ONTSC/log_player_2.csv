"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $170. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $120 as possible. Alice's initial offer of $170 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price. It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $170 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $155 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $120 limit. It's worth rejecting and continuing to negotiate for a lower price. Bob can still secure the product from John for $120 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $145. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $160. I'm willing to give you a small discount, so I'm offering it to you for $158. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $158. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $158
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $158 is still too high for Bob.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation and hasn't been able to get Alice to drop below $155.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is not going to budge further.  Given the limited number of rounds remaining, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $120, ensuring he gets the best possible price."
