"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $105? That's still a fair price for you, and it works better for my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110.  I'm still a little hesitant to go that high.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $107.50 is still a bit too low. How about we meet at $109? It's closer to your price and still gives me a bit more than your previous offer.",109.0,Alice,5,
