"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, and I'd like to save some money on the purchase.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true market value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This accounts for the value you're getting while still recognizing the worth of what I'm offering.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay, considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's make this happen.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer. It's a win-win, giving you significant value while still being fair to me.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
