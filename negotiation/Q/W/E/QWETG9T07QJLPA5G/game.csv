"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $20,000 is quite a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand you're on a budget, but $6,000 is quite low for this product. Could you do $13,000? I'm confident it's worth that investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
