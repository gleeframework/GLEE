"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good deal, but Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price. While buying from John is an option, it's not the most financially beneficial choice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product!  While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $900,000. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving you a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price. While buying from John is an option, it's still more expensive than potentially negotiating a better deal with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000. It's getting closer to where I'm comfortable.  However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value we've both placed on it.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $950,000. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point and is a good deal for Bob.  It's likely that Alice won't come down further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  This offer represents a significant savings compared to buying from John, making it the best option available."
