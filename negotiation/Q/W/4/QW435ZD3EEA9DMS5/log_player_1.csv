Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can get more. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the following rounds.  I want to see if I can get him to come up a little more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product and the market price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're getting close to my minimum price, and I'm concerned that if I continue to reject, he might walk away or offer a lower price in the next round.  $1,250,000 is a good outcome, and I don't want to risk getting less."
