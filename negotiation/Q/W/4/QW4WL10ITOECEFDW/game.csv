"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $7,500 for the product. It's a great compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $6,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,000, which would be $7,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",7750.0,Alice,5,
