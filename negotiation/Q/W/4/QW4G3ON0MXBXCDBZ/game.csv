"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $950,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000? That's a firm offer from my side.",900000.0,Bob,4,
