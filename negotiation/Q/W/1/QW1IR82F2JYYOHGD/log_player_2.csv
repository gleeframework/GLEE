"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating a lower price, knowing we have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's initial offer and our maximum budget.  A lower starting point gives us more room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Direct:**  We want to maintain a good relationship with Alice in case we can reach an agreement. 
* **Justification:** We provide a brief reason for our counteroffer (""a bit too high"") without revealing our absolute maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, considering the product's value to you. This price is still within a reasonable range. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is better than her initial offer, but it's still more than we want to pay and above our fallback option with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about a lower price and encourage her to move closer to our range. 
* **John as Leverage:** We have the security of John's offer, so we can afford to be a little more assertive in our negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic suggests a spirit of compromise and might be more appealing to Alice.
* **Final Offer (Implied):** By stating this is ""the highest I can go,"" we signal firmness without being aggressive. It puts the decision more in Alice's court.
* **Matching John:**  Crucially, we match John's offer.  This is strategic because:
    * **Best Possible Deal:** If Alice accepts, we get the product at our desired price.
    * **Fallback Option:** If Alice rejects, we haven't lost anything and can go with John."
