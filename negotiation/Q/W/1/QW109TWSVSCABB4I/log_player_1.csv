Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  This ensures you make a profit, as you value the product at $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 

By starting high, you can potentially secure a higher price, while also leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate for a higher price.  

Here's why:

* **Potential for higher profit:** You can potentially get closer to the $950,000 mark or a price in between.
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting his offer shows you're not desperate and are willing to walk away, potentially pressuring him to offer more. 

You can then counter with a price closer to your original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This leaves room for both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested in continuing this discussion."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  It demonstrates you're open to negotiation but not willing to sell at a huge loss.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** It shows you're willing to meet him halfway, making him more likely to accept.

By counter-offering, you maintain control and signal that you're serious about getting a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice:

* **Close to your minimum:** $850,000 is only $50,000 less than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's no guarantee Bob will come up any higher, and you risk further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or even a stalemate.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and might result in you missing out on potential opportunities with other buyers.

While you might be able to squeeze out a little more, it's not worth the potential risk of losing the sale altogether or ending up with a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable deal."
