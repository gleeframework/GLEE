"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain from owning this product.  Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
