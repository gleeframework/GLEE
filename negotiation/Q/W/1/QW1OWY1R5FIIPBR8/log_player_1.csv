**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at a price significantly below your minimum. While he calls $775,000 his ""final counteroffer"", there's no guarantee he won't come up a bit if you reject it.  However, it's risky to continue gambling on that. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000.  It's better to take the guaranteed profit than risk Bob walking away and potentially getting stuck with a lower offer or no deal at all."
