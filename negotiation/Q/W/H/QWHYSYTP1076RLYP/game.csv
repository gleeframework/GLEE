"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product but $120 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you say?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit out of my range. I'm very serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to pay $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to reach a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're serious about getting the product, Bob! However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you've made concessions, but I'm still not quite there.  $95 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $92.50.  This is a fair price for both of us and ensures we can close this deal.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $92.50. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $95, but I'm not budging below that. I'm confident you'll love the product, and I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room.",95.0,Alice,7,
