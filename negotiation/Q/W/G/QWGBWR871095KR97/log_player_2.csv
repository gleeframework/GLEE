"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Saves money:** $140 is less than your $150 maximum and cheaper than buying from John.
* **Gets the product:**  You achieve your goal of acquiring the product."
