"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate down from this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my initial offer. I believe this is a fair counteroffer, considering Bob's previous offer and the value he sees in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to drop my price a bit more to $1,350,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a good compromise considering Bob's previous offer and the value of the product.  I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and I'm starting to run out of time. There's a chance he might not go higher and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  I'll take the $1,275,000 and move on."
