"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement. Considering its worth to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are looking to spend no more than $10,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice values the product at $15,000, so there's a gap between your desired price and her valuation.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.**  It allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.**  $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above your ideal price.
* **Be polite and positive.**  Maintain a respectful tone to encourage further negotiation.
* **Offer a specific price.**  Avoid vague language and provide a clear number for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'd like to try to find a middle ground. I'm proposing a price of $11,000 for the product. This still allows for a profit while being more accommodating to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a step down from her previous offer, $11,000 is still above your maximum budget.
* **There's still potential to get a better price.** Alice is willing to negotiate, so there's a good chance you can get closer to your ideal price of $10,000.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation.** It gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. While I value your product, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $10,750 as a final offer? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continue to push for a lower price.**  $10,750 is still within your budget but closer to your ideal price.
* **Frame it as a final offer.** This creates urgency and pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Highlight the benefits for both parties.**  Emphasize that this price is a fair compromise and will allow both of you to achieve your goals."

Round 5

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price.** While it's much closer to your budget, you're still paying more than you want to.
* **You have more rounds to negotiate.** There's no rush to accept this offer, especially since you have the option to buy from John for a lower price.
* **You can still try to get a better price.** There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her offer even further, especially if she wants to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility and effort in this negotiation. However, $10,875 is still slightly above my target price.  Would you be willing to accept $10,700 for the product? This price point would be a fair and final offer for me, and it would allow you to gain some profit as well."", ""product_price"": 10700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continue to push for a lower price.** This counteroffer is still within your budget, but it's closer to your desired price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue this discussion. Considering the value you place on the product and aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome, I'm willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $10,750 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to your ideal price.**  While it's not your exact target of $10,000, it's only $750 more.
* **You have limited rounds left.**  With only three rounds remaining, it's likely that you won't be able to negotiate a lower price.
* **The risk of losing the deal.** If you reject Alice's offer and she doesn't counter, you might be forced to buy from John at a higher price.

**It's a calculated risk, but accepting this offer seems like the most strategic move at this point.**"
