"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're still interested, let me know!",8000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can do $8,500, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal!",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, it seems like we are struggling to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to move up slightly to $7,250. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",7250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to move up, but I'm still not sure $7,250 is enough. I can do $8,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let's make it happen!",8000.0,Alice,7,
