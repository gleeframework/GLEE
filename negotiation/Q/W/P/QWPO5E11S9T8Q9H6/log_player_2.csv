Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $8,850, which would be $9,025. This is the best I can do. What do you think?

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice seems pretty firm on her price, and this offer is significantly less than John's $12,000 price."
