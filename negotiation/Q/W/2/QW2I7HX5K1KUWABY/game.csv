"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little too high for me.  How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $127. That's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",127.0,Alice,5,
