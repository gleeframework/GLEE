"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to pay $9,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
