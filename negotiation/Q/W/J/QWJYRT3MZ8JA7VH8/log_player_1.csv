Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $175. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely Bob will counter-offer.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, going ridiculously high (e.g., $300) will likely make Bob walk away without a counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the safety net of John who will buy the product for $150, ensuring we don't lose out completely.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
