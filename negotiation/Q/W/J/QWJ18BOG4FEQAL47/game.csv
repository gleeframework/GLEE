"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12000. How about we try $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $13500? It's a bit above your latest offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my limit. How about we try $13000 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original $14000, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
