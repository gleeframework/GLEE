"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential value to me. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny!",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. It's a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13,000, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
