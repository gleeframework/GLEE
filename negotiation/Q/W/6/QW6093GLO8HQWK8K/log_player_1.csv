Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

 Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below the product's worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still reflects the product's value. Let's work together to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your latest offer is closer, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Bob's offer is still too low.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  It's a guaranteed sale and I'm not willing to risk losing out on that by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
