"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it allows me to cover my costs.
