"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it allows me to cover my costs.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
