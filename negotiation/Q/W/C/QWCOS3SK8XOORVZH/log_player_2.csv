"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Even though $14,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation to get an even better deal. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he has 10 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm going to need a lower price. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $13,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. He's already gotten her down to $13,500, which is closer to his desired price than the original $14,000. He still has time to try and negotiate a lower price, and buying from John for $15,000 is not yet the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,375.  This is a fair price that considers both of our positions, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. While $13,375 is a good price, he's still within his budget and has time to try and get a better deal.  He's only had 5 rounds, and can continue to negotiate. Buying from John for $15,000 is still not the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,375 is still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and agree on $13,250. I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 13250}
