# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $850000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but I'm willing to make some concessions to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $850,000 is still above my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my initial counteroffer of $700,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $800000 to make it worth my while. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is my final offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made significant concessions and is now at a price point that's within my budget and significantly lower than John's offer. While I'd prefer to pay closer to $750,000, it's not worth risking losing this unique opportunity. Accepting Alice's final offer of $825,000 is the best option for me at this point."
