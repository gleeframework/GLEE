{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from the value he places on the product, making it attractive. At the same time, it allows me to potentially earn more than the value John is willing to pay. This strategy allows for potential negotiation while also providing a safety net with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While he's interested in the product, his offer is not financially viable for me.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to compromise. I'd accept $1,000,000 for the product. This price still provides me with a reasonable profit while staying within your budget range. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
