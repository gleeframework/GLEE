Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.
