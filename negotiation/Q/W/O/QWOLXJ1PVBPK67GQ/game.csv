"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand you need to make a profit, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not sure $1,050,000 is enough for me to consider it a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $1,075,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
