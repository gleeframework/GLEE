Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer and is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a more agreeable price point for Bob and we can reach an agreement."
