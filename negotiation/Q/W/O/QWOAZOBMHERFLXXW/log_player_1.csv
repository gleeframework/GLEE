"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I have 9 rounds left and I can always sell to John if I need to.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair offer, given my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's find a way to bridge the gap and make this work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, I'm running out of time. I have 6 rounds left and I'm not sure if I can get a higher offer from Bob.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk getting nothing at all."
