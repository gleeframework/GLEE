"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get a good return on my investment.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget, but it's a starting point. You can do better. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts by acknowledging Alice's offer and showing willingness to negotiate.  It proposes a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for a compromise within your budget.  It also frames the price as ""fair"" by highlighting both your budget constraints and Alice's stated value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still above my budget. I want to try to get a better deal, ideally closer to my $800,000 goal.  Rejecting her offer allows me to send another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair offer, given my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's find a way to bridge the gap and make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. It offers a price that's closer to Alice's last offer but still remains within your budget.  It also reinforces the idea of a fair compromise, emphasizing both your budget and the value Alice places on the product."
