"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair offer, given my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's find a way to bridge the gap and make this work for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
