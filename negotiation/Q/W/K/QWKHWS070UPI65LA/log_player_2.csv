You can try to get a better price from Alice.  $140 is still a bit more than you're willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a little, but $130 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

$135 is a good price, especially since you can always walk away and buy from John."
