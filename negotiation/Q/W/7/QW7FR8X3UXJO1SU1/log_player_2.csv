"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $145 is within your budget, you can save more money by rejecting Alice's offer. You know John is willing to sell it for $150, but there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price in a second round of negotiation."
