"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1300000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above your maximum price of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness about the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1275000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is within your budget and is closer to your ideal price point.  It's a good deal considering your alternative is buying from John for $1,500,000. There's no guarantee you'll get a better price in the next round, so it's wise to accept this offer."
