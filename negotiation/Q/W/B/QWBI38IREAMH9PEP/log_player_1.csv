It's important to start with a price higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll get a price closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my minimum price and his perceived value. There's a lot of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $15,000 represents the premium value of this product, I understand that might be too high for your budget. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this price is more than fair considering the value you'll be getting."", ""product_price"": 13000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Don't accept a lowball offer:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below his own perceived value of $10,000. This suggests he has room to negotiate upwards.
* **Show flexibility but stay firm:** Coming down to $13,000 shows willingness to negotiate but still keeps the price significantly above your minimum ($12,000).
* **Justify your price:** Highlighting the product's value helps justify your counteroffer and encourages Bob to meet you closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do something closer to $9,500? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is moving closer to his perceived value:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to his own perceived value of $10,000. This is a positive sign that continued negotiation could be beneficial. 
* **Still below my minimum:** Accepting $9,500 would mean selling below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for compromise:** There's still a gap between our positions, but it's narrowing. A counteroffer aiming for a price point between $9,500 and $12,000 is the next logical step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end and a fair deal for a high-quality product like this."", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise by splitting the difference between Bob's last offer ($9,500) and your desired price ($12,000). 
* **Highlighting compromise:** Emphasizing that you're making a significant reduction reinforces your willingness to negotiate and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Reiterating value:**  Mentioning the product's high quality helps justify the higher price point, even with the reduction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,250? That's a firm offer from my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above the minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is finally above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **""Firm offer"" signals the end:** By stating this is his ""firm offer,"" Bob is signaling that he's unlikely to go any higher.
* **Better than risking a stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate and force you to sell to John for $12,000. Accepting Bob's offer secures a profit above your minimum."
