"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck in a loop here, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to make another serious offer of $6800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. I'd like to make one more offer before considering other options.",6800.0,Bob,6,
