"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, the price you've offered is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $1,500,000 on this product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let's start with this offer. ",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product. Perhaps we can find a middle ground. How about we settle at $2,000,000? This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  How about we settle at $1,900,000?  This recognizes the significant value this product offers while acknowledging our negotiation.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I'm glad we're making progress.  However, $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000.  This is a fair price considering the value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
