Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm indicating my willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. This also allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget.
* **High-Value Product:** My message emphasizes that the product is unique and potentially valuable, which can help justify the price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own.
* If negotiations stall or become unfavorable, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. This means there's no potential for a higher profit if I continue negotiating.
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate could take time and effort, and there's no guarantee that Bob will eventually meet a higher price.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** John is ready to buy at my minimum price, providing a secure and immediate sale.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John is the most efficient and risk-free option in this scenario. It guarantees me my minimum profit and eliminates the uncertainty and time investment of further negotiation."
