"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you see in the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's try to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
