Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's my guaranteed profit from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $119 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive. 
* **Maintain Attractiveness for Bob:** $119 still offers Bob a $19 gain compared to his perceived value of the product. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer appealing enough for him to accept."
