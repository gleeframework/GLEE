"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000.  He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, so he has room to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the price down as much as possible. While Alice's offer of $875,000 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his target of $800,000.  He has 7 rounds remaining and the option to buy from John, so he can continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my initial offer of $850,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your commitment to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $860,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his goal of $800,000, but Alice's offer of $860,000 is still a bit too high. With 5 rounds remaining, Bob can continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice to come down further or potentially accept his previous offer of $850,000. He still has the option to buy from John if the negotiations don't go in his favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $860,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $855,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 855000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $855,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $870,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his goal, but Alice's offer of $870,000 is still higher than his target.  With only 3 rounds remaining, there is a high risk that Alice will not come down further, especially since she has already made several concessions.  It's likely that Alice will continue to be firm, given that she still believes the product is worth $1,000,000.  Therefore, it's more prudent for Bob to accept the offer from John at $800,000. This guarantees him a purchase within his budget and avoids the risk of losing more time and potentially ending up with a higher price."
