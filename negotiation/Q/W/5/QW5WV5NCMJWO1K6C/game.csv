"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and am open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
