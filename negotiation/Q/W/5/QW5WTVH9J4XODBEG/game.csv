"I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm not comfortable paying $850,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $750,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",725000.0,Bob,4,
