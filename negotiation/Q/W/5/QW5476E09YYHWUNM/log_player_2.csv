# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you'll get a valuable asset at a price that works for you, and I'll be able to move it quickly. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $750,000 is still a long way from a fair price. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. That's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable offer for both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from $900,000, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Buying from John guarantees the product at your target price."
