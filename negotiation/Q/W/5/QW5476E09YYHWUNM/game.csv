"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you'll get a valuable asset at a price that works for you, and I'll be able to move it quickly. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the current market and the value I see in it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I need the price to be closer to my budget.  How about $750,000?  That's a significant offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $750,000 is still a long way from a fair price. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. That's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable offer for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,
