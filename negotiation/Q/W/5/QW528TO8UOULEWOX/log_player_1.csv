Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** $19,000 sets a strong anchor price. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price higher than your guaranteed $15,000. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you don't have time constraints or other reasons to prioritize a quick sale."
