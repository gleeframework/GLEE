"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than its worth to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to pursue this better deal."
