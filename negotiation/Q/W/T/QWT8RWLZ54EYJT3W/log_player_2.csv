"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price, closer to her $8,000 value.  You can always fall back on buying from John at $12,000 if needed."
