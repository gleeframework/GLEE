"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
