"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and for me, it's a good starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than your perceived value of the product.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and gives you a good profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a significant value, and it's a fair price for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still above your maximum value.  You can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows for another round of negotiation and potentially a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is closer, but still above what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's my maximum value and allows you to sell the product without taking a significant loss."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
