"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,500. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to make a small compromise. Let's meet at $10,500, and we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
