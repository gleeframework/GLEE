"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to see if he's truly interested in the product and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to reject it and counter. I still believe I can get more for the product, even if it means risking a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value and closer to the middle ground. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm in my belief that the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer again. While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'm still hopeful that I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob, especially since we're getting closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still well above my minimum value. I'm trying to show Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal, but I'm also not going to give away the product for cheap."
