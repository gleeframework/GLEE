"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us, but considering its value to you, we're open to discussing a fair price. Let's start at $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial valuation, Bob can potentially get the product for even less by negotiating further.  He's willing to go to John for $80, which means he's clearly motivated to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $95 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. To move forward, let's consider a price closer to our valuation while still being reasonable for you. How about $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still focused on getting the best possible price.  While Alice's offer of $90 is a slight improvement, it's still above Bob's target price of $80. He knows he can secure the product from John for $80, so he's motivated to continue negotiating with Alice to try and get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to pay $87 for it. It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in between our previous offers. How about $88 for the product? This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is very close to his target price of $80.  Alice has come down to $88, which is only $8 more than John's price.  It's reasonable to assume that further negotiation may result in even lower offers from Alice, but there's no guarantee.  Accepting the offer at $88 provides a good balance of value and risk for Bob."
