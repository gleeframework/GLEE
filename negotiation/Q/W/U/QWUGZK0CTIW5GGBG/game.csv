"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and highly valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny, but I'll let you decide. My initial offer for the product is $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Could you consider a price closer to that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand you're looking for a price closer to $1200000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000. Could you consider a price of $1275000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price of $1275000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1300000 is your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to go up to $1290000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",1290000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $1290000, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at that price. However, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $1290000, but I need to add a small premium for the hassle of negotiating with you. I'll sell the product to you for $1300000.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
