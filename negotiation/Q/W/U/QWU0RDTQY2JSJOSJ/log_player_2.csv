{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. While $130 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price.  $135 is closer to his ideal price than $150, but he can still try to push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  I'm still hoping to get it for a bit closer to my target. Would you be willing to go down to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, and Alice's offer is a good compromise.  At $132.50, Bob is saving $17.50 compared to buying from John, which is a significant savings.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice getting frustrated and holding firm at $135 is present.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal for Bob."
