Round 2

I'm going to try and get a better price than $110. Bob is clearly interested in the product and I can likely get closer to my desired price range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $115. It's a good price and I'm getting closer to my desired range. It's also better than selling to John for $100."
