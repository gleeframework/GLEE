It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  $120 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see if she's willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

``` 
$110 is a good price, especially since Alice is willing to negotiate. It's lower than her original price, and it's within your budget.  It's better to accept this offer than to risk another counteroffer or going to John."
