Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk Bob not reaching a satisfactory price."
