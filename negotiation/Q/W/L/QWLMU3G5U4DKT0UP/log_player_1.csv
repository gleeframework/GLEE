"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth at least $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will gain by purchasing the product, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not asking for my full $15,000 value, allowing for some give-and-take in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is higher for you, but I'm only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore options to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time for a Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a price that's closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $10,500, he's still getting a product worth $8,000 to him.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I would like to propose $10,000 as the price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value you place on it while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Continues:** Although Bob is getting closer, there's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Time for a Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, attempting to push the price closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a little too low for me.  Considering the product's value to me and the progress we've made, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This gives you a good price and me a fair return. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm making a smaller counteroffer this time, indicating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining my desired profit.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, but I'm still hopeful that I can get a better offer from Bob.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to the final few rounds, and I'm running out of time to negotiate a better deal with Bob.
* **Not Enough Profit:**  $11,000 is still significantly below my desired value of $15,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a large loss.
* **Secure a Profit:** John is willing to pay my full asking price.  Selling to John guarantees me the maximum profit, and it's a safer option at this point in the negotiation."
