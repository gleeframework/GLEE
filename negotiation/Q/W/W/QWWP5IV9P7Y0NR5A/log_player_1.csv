"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is below what I'm hoping to get, I'm willing to compromise. I'm confident this product can be a valuable asset for you. How about we split the difference? I'll accept $11,500 for the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not going to sell myself short."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $10,750. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for a product with this much potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 6

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000. While I'd like to get more, Bob's latest offer is too low, and I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back and forth.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
