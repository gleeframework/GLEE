Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start with a strong position. Offering a price slightly below that ($950,000) aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference between your valuation and Bob's.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification of value:** While you don't want to reveal your absolute bottom line, using phrases like ""unique value"" and ""limited-time offer"" subtly reinforces the product's worth.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer before you have to move on to John."
