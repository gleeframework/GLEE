{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me the best chance of getting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum valuation of $100. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm offering $110, which is still above my minimum valuation of $100, but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still only comfortable paying $95. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. While Bob is offering $95, which is closer to my minimum valuation, it's still not enough to make a profit that I'm comfortable with.  John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
