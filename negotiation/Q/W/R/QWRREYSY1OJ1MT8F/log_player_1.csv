Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $15,000 gives room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price without revealing my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while leaving room to accept Bob's offer if he's willing to meet or come close to my desired price."
