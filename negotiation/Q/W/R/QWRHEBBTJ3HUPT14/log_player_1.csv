{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $100 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, but it's also significantly below my minimum selling price. This gives Bob a reason to negotiate, but also leaves room for me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low for me.  While I'd love to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell for so far below my minimum.  I'll counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and meet at $102.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $95? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, his offer is still below my minimum selling price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for a guaranteed profit."
