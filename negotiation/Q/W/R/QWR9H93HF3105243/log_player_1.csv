Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. I am willing to pay $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but given the market conditions and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose $1,025,000 as the purchase price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal considering we're nearing the end of the negotiations.  I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations or selling to John for a lower amount."
