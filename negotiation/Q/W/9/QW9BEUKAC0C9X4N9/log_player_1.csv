Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate.  We need to signal we're willing to move, but not desperately.  Let's see if we can draw Bob up a bit more."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems anchored at $1,200,000, but we still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer.  It's time to show more flexibility to entice Bob while aiming slightly above our fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle this at $1,275,000? This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you'll receive."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation window. This offer:

*  Shows significant movement from our previous position.
*  Is a strong signal we're aiming for a deal.
*  Leaves room for one more counter-offer from Bob if he's still hesitant.
*  Keeps us comfortably above John's offer, ensuring we're maximizing potential profit."

Round 8

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firmly anchored at $1,200,000 and hasn't budged. While we have two rounds left, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer. Accepting now guarantees a $200,000 profit over John's offer, and the risk of losing Bob entirely by pushing further is high."
