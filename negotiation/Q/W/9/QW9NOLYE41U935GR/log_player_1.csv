Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm starting high, aiming for my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if I'm willing to negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to go lower than $110. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and I can move on."
