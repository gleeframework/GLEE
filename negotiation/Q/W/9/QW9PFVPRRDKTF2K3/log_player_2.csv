"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. How about $11,000? It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. $11,000 is a good price for him, especially since he can always buy it from John for $15,000.  While he might be able to get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away or the hassle of continuing the negotiation."
