"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $85? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",85.0,Bob,4,
