"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the value that this product brings to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1100000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also being reasonable for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my limit. I'm thinking of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart.

I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be closer to my budget.
