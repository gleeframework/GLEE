"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000 to you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? That's still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
