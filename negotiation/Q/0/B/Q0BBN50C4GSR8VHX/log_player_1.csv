``` 

While we could continue negotiating, accepting Bob's offer at $1,160,000 is a strong deal. We're already significantly above our minimum acceptable price, and Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  Continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns and carries the risk of Bob walking away altogether."
