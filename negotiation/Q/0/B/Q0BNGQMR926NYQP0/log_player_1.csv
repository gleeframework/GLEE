Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting high allows you to potentially gain much more if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value and potential,"" you aim to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open for negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but invites Bob's feedback and potential counter-offer, leaving space for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob as a valuable potential buyer.  If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $800,000."
