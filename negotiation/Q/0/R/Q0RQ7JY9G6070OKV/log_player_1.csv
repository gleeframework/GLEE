Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that?

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me, and I'm not desperate to sell. I'll try to get a better price from Bob, or I can always sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 100}
