"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. Can you consider that?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",100.0,Alice,5,
