Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $170. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Starting High:** A higher initial offer allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $170 seems like a more considered price than a round number like $200, potentially making it seem more appealing.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject a high offer outright. However, since you have a backup buyer, it's a calculated risk to try for a higher profit margin."
