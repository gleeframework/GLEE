"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth the full $11000 to me. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $10800? This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10800. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $10500? This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
