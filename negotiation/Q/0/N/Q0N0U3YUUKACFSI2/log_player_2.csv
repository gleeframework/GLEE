# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than Alice's estimated value of $1,000,000. This means there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring counteroffers to try and secure a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,150,000 is my ideal target, I'm willing to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This allows me a fair return while still offering you a significant gain.
