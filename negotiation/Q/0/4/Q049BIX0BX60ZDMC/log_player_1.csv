Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially earn more than the $800,000 I'd get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully it will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more attractive price for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's only $85,000 less than my initial offer.  The negotiation is taking time and energy, and selling to Bob for $885,000 is better than risking a further rejected counteroffer and then having to settle with John for $800,000."
