"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, as it represents the full value of the product to you. I'm confident that it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll be selling it to John for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and you have the option of buying it from John for the same price, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer. You can reject her offer and still get the product at the same price from John."
