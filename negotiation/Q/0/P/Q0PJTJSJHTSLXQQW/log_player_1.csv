Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Keeping John in mind, I'm aware I can always walk away and get my minimum price. This strengthens my position.

I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,500 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000 and even below Bob's perceived value of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This provides a fallback option and gives me negotiating leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's still a great price for a product that's worth much more to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Offering $12,000 represents a compromise between my minimum desired price and Bob's offer. It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiations.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the value of the product to Bob ($12,000) strengthens my position and justifies the proposed price.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to consider my offer."
