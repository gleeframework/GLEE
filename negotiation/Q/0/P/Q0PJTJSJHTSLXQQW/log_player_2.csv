"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Low:**  Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer (around 25% less) gives room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's willingness to move on the price. 
* **Not Insultingly Low:**  While aiming low, $10,500 is still a reasonable jump from John's $12,000 offer, signaling genuine interest.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message maintains a positive tone and expresses a willingness to continue the conversation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's still a great price for a product that's worth much more to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your fallback price of $12,000. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John since you'll be getting the same price."
