"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to save as much money as possible, so I'm aiming for a price significantly lower than my $8,000 maximum.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** While $6,000 is a lowball offer, it gives Alice the opportunity to counter and find a price point that works for both of us.
* **Backup Plan:** I still have the option to buy from John for $8,000 if negotiations with Alice don't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met me halfway, $9,000 is still higher than John's price of $8,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I don't want to seem overly eager to accept, as it might weaken my negotiating position.  
* **Testing the Waters:**  By rejecting this offer, I can gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between her latest offer ($9,000) and my previous offer ($6,000) but leans slightly in my favor. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Projecting Fairness:** By framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm subtly encouraging Alice to see it as a reasonable solution for both parties.
* **Staying Below Maximum:** This offer keeps me below my $8,000 maximum, ensuring I'm getting a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to give up on my original target price. I'll meet you at $8,500, which is still a good compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice's offer of $8,500 is higher than my alternative option of buying from John for $8,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better price from Alice. She seems to be holding firm around the $8,500 mark.
* **Securing the Deal:**  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed lower price from John.  Delaying further could risk losing out on both deals if Alice also decides to walk away."
