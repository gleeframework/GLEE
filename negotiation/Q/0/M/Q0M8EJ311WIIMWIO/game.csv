"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, however,  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $11,500 reflects that more accurately. Would you be willing to meet me at that price point?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,750. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
