"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a perfect fit for you and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This product is truly valuable, and I believe that's a fair price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
