"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. Could you do $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $15,000 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? I'm really interested in this product, but that's my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,4,
