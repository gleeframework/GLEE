"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice's first offer is exactly that, it's reasonable to try and negotiate a lower price. There's no immediate reason to accept or buy from John, as there's a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However, my budget for this type of product is a bit lower. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening the negotiation:**  By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, Bob establishes a clear intention to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer (budget limitations) while still acknowledging the value of the product. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  A $2,000 drop is a sizable reduction, but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Open ended:**  Ending with a question encourages Alice to respond and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, showing flexibility.
* **Still room for negotiation:**  $11,000 is still above Bob's initial offer, leaving space for further negotiation.
* **Avoiding hasty decisions:**  It's still early in the negotiation process.  Rejecting allows Bob to explore further possibilities to achieve a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $10,500.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** Bob shows persistence in achieving a lower price by making another counteroffer.
* **Mid-point strategy:**  The offer is a mid-point between Bob's last offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle while still seeking a favorable outcome.
* **Final offer signal:**  Stating this is a ""final offer"" increases the pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Reasoning:** Bob reiterates the value of the product to justify his offer and make it seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I still feel that $10500 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10750. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has significantly reduced her price from her initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Midpoint Compromise:**  Alice's offer is very close to Bob's last offer, indicating a potential meeting point.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and having to pay John's higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While a slightly lower price might be possible, it's not guaranteed. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price well below the initial asking price and within Bob's budget."
