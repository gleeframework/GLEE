"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefit for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While $9,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my ideal price point. There's room for further negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can gauge how serious he is about buying the product and potentially push him to come closer to my preferred price.
* **Not Desperate:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is my absolute last resort.  I want to maximize my profit, and I believe further negotiation with Bob is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm raising the price slightly, demonstrating my commitment to achieving a higher price.  
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering to split the difference with Bob suggests a willingness to compromise and makes it seem like I'm being fair.
* **Emphasize Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value and the investment he'll be making strengthens my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to meet in the middle again. How about $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** $9,250 is very close to my target of $9,500.  
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I keep rejecting Bob, he might walk away, and I'd be stuck with John's $8,000 offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer is a good compromise, ensuring I make a decent profit."
