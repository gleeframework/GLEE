# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

The offer from Alice is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's counteroffer is a fair compromise. Accepting it means securing the product for a price that is within your budget and significantly less than John's offer."
