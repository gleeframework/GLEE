I'm starting with a price of $140. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but still allows me to earn more than my minimum value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $120 is my minimum value, I'm not desperate to sell.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping the price slightly to $130. This shows flexibility, but still leaves a profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering his initial offer was too low."

Bob is clearly unwilling to go higher than $120.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with him.  I'll sell to John for $120, which at least guarantees me my minimum value."
