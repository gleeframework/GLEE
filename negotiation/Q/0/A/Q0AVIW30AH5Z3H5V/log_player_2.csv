"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000. Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000.  John is also offering the product for $1,000,000.  There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer, so you can reject it and still get the product from John for the same price."
