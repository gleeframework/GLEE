Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone sets the stage for a collaborative negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  While $900,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to Bob.
* **John is a Strong Backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for a higher price, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This price would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being a great deal for you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating that this price is still a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Urgency and Closing:**  The phrase ""Let's see if we can close this deal"" adds a touch of urgency and encourages Bob to accept. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  This counteroffer shows I'm still open to negotiation, but it also demonstrates my commitment to getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $950000 is not in my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a better result. 
* **John Offers a Secure Deal:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money.  Selling to John guarantees a safe and satisfactory outcome.
* **Time is Valuable:**  Continued negotiation with Bob risks losing time and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  Selling to John is the quickest and most reliable way to secure my desired outcome."
