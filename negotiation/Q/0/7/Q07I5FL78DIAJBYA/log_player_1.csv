Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $700,000? I think this would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
