"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $700,000? I think this would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a great deal, while also acknowledging the product's value to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
