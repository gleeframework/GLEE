"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
