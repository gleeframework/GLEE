"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,000,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her offer, making it even less appealing to Bob. Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, and this offer is higher than that.  It's now in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid further negotiation."
