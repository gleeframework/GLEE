$18,000 is far too high.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice will come down in price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $12,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $18,000 is my initial asking price, reflecting the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but  $12,000 is too low.  How about we meet halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

$15,000 is still too high. It's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice will come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $15,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's try to reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $14,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$14,000 is still above my budget, but Alice is getting closer. It's worth seeing if we can get closer to my ideal price with a counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $14,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
