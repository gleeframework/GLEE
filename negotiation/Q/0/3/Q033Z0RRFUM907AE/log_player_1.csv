Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to try and get the highest price possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **For Bob:** He gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him ($800,000 value - $950,000 price = -$150,000 profit).
    * **For Alice:** You earn $50,000 more than selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing adds a layer of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

This offer balances maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
