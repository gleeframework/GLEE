Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still talking, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $97. That's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go below $97.  Since you have the option to buy from John at $100, it makes more sense to take that deal now rather than risk Alice sticking to her price and losing the opportunity for a slightly better deal."
