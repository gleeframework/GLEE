"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $1,000,000. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but $1,350,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,100,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While $1,225,000 is still a decent price, Bob wants to save as much as possible. Since Alice is willing to negotiate, there's still potential to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and see if he can get closer to his desired price."
