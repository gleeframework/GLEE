"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll find it meets all your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my budget.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  I will reject her offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11,000. Would that be more to your liking? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While it's closer, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll counter with a lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still slightly above my limit. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again at $10,500. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above my budget of $10,000.  While she has been willing to negotiate, it's clear we aren't going to reach an agreement that works for both of us. At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John at a price I'm comfortable with."
