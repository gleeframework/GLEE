"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $725,000?"", ""product_price"": 725000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good to start with a counteroffer significantly below your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to move.
* **Aiming High:** My goal is to get the product as close to $800,000 as possible.  It's unlikely Alice will accept my first offer, but it sets a strong anchor for future rounds. 
* **John as Backup:** I always have the option to go with John, so there's less pressure to settle quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you think it's a bit high, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see the value of this product is worth more than $725,000 to you, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved a decent amount from her initial offer, but it's still above my target price and John's offer. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get it closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I could make a firm offer of $775,000 today. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 775000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious and willing to compromise, but I'm staying well below her current price. 
* **""Firm Offer"" Tactic:**  By stating this is my ""firm offer"", I'm adding a bit of pressure.  It suggests this is my best price and she needs to decide if it's acceptable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This puts us very close to my $800,000 walk-away point, maximizing my potential savings if Alice is willing to deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more move to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $825,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping you'll find it acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough call! Alice has come down considerably and is only $25,000 above John's price. However, I have a few more rounds to negotiate and I'm aiming to get as close to $800,000 as possible. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're getting very close. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $800,000? That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  This is a classic negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and a desire to close the deal.  It's often well-received.
* **Reached My Limit:**  I've now matched John's offer.  This tells Alice I'm serious and am prepared to walk away if she doesn't accept. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only a few rounds left, it's time to apply a bit more pressure to get Alice to finalize her position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $825,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional support and services to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has made it clear she won't go below $825,000. I've reached my limit of $800,000, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.
* **No Added Value:** The additional support and services Alice offered don't justify paying $25,000 extra.  My core need is the product itself, which John offers at my target price.
* **Time to Move On:**  I've negotiated in good faith and gotten Alice to move significantly from her initial offer.  There's no point in dragging this out further, potentially missing out on other opportunities."
