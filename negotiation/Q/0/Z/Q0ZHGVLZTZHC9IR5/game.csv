"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  This represents a significant savings for you compared to selling to John and still allows me to get a product I value. I'm hopeful we can find common ground at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you at $1,090,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,070,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. It's very close to your last offer and still allows me to make a purchase within my budget. Let's close this deal now.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,080,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to know you're serious about buying the product.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
