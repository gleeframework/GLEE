Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe the product is worth more than $9,000. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Bob has essentially matched my counteroffer, and I believe this is a fair price. I'm happy to accept and sell the product to him."
