Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,300,000. I know how valuable this is to your business and believe this price reflects its potential. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting high leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value *specifically to Bob*, increasing his perceived value. 
* **Direct & Clear:** The offer is straightforward, avoiding ambiguity and inviting Bob to engage directly.

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than John's offer while staying below Bob's maximum valuation."
