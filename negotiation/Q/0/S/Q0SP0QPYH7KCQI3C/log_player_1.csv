"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $100. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, I think he's willing to pay a decent price for it. However, I'm not willing to sell it to him for $100, as that's below my minimum price of $80.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer the product to Bob for $110.
