"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's significantly higher than his maximum budget, and he has a guaranteed alternative with John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

Bob should start by making a significant counteroffer.  He knows Alice's price is too high, and he's aiming to save as much as possible.  A counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a good starting point.  It's well below his budget, but might still be attractive to Alice if the product is worth less to her than that.  It also provides a clear negotiation range for further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. There's no reason to accept this offer when a cheaper option is available.  Bob should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

Bob should counter with $1,150,000. This is still lower than John's price but closer to Alice's last offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still attempting to save money.  This creates a good starting point for a potential compromise."
