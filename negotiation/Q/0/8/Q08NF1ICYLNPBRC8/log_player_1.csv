Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, as I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I also want to see if he's serious about buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm reducing my offer to $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,150,000 is still a good profit and a significant gain over selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's also worth noting that continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate, potentially resulting in a sale to John."
