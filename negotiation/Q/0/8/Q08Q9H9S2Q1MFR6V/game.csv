"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a good starting point for further discussion.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,150,000 is a significant sum,  the true value of this product, in terms of its potential impact, is much higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
