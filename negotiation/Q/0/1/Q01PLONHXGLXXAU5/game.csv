"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. Please let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1000000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1300000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit far from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your desired price, but $1600000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1400000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement soon.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $1400000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to lower my price to $1550000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll see it that way. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1550000 is getting closer to what I can afford, I'm still hoping to come in just a bit lower.  I'm offering $1450000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're nearly there!  I understand your budget constraints, but $1450000 just isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for this valuable product. Let's make this happen.",1500000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1500000 is still a bit beyond what I can comfortably afford, I'm willing to go up to $1475000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",1475000.0,Bob,10,
