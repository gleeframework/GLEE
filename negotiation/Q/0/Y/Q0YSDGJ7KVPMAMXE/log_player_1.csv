"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is $100,000 above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's better to keep negotiating with him to see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is still above my minimum price, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway. This strategy aims to keep the negotiation going while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee of a better deal.  Accepting his offer secures my minimum value and avoids the risk of further rejections or losing the deal altogether."
