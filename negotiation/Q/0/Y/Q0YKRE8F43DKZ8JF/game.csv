"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to discussing further.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth less than you think. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm confident this product can bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I still think $9,500 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid we're too far apart on price.  $10,500 is really cutting it close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to make one last offer at $11,500. This is a very generous offer considering the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one last offer, Alice, but I'm afraid $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one last time.",9000.0,Bob,6,
