Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth less than you think. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 undervalues the product significantly.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make one last offer, Alice, but I'm afraid $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one last time.

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $8,000."
