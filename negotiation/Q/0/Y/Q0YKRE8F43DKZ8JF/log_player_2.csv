# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to discussing further.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth less than you think.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm confident this product can bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I still think $9,500 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid we're too far apart on price.  $10,500 is really cutting it close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to make one last offer at $11,500. This is a very generous offer considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.
