"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but not outrageous. This allows some room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me.  I'll be keeping a close eye on Bob's responses to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, Bob's initial offer is very low. I want to see if I can get him to come up in price a bit. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm aiming to find a compromise that's closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, which makes me concerned. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm trying to find a balance between getting the best possible price and not risking losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum, but I'm also showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  This is my best offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept it. If he rejects, I'll be ready to consider John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer keeps getting lower, and I'm not confident he'll come up to my minimum.  Rather than risk losing more time with him, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $12,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good outcome."
