"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
