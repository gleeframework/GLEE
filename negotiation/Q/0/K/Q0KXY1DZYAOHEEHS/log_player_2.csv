{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$600,000 is a good starting point, but there's a lot of room for negotiation.  We should try to get a better price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% reduction from Alice's initial price. This will give us room to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $500,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my ideal price. I'm confident I can negotiate further and get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise.  $450,000 is still a good deal for me, and hopefully, it's close enough to Alice's desired price to reach an agreement this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $550,000 is still too high. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm meeting Alice halfway from her last offer. This demonstrates a commitment to finding common ground, and hopefully, she will accept this offer. If she rejects, we'll need to consider the remaining rounds and potentially make a more aggressive counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is back to her original offer, and we're down to the last few rounds. It's clear she's not willing to budge much, and the risk of running out of time and being stuck with John's overpriced offer is too high.  I'll buy the product from John, as I'm still well within my budget."
