"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still give you a good deal, and it's a step closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
