Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  Mentioning the value to Bob (""considering its value to you"")  helps frame the offer as fair and encourages him to consider the benefits.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not my absolute minimum. It allows for potential counteroffers and gives Bob a chance to feel involved in the process.
* **Plan B:**  Always keep in mind that John is willing to pay $15,000. If negotiations with Bob fail, you have a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price range. There's still room for negotiation.
* **John is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still give you a good deal, and it's a step closer to what I need. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  By offering $10,500, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Focus on fairness:** I emphasize the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob to incentivize acceptance.
* **Maintain leverage:**  While I'm lowering the price, I'm not giving in entirely. I'm keeping some leverage in case Bob rejects again.
* **John as a safety net:** If Bob continues to refuse, I can still fall back on selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is firmly at $9,000, and I've already compromised. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better result.
* **John's offer is much better:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a much higher price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might drag out the process and risk losing John's offer.

By choosing to sell to John, I ensure a satisfactory outcome and avoid potential losses due to further negotiation."
