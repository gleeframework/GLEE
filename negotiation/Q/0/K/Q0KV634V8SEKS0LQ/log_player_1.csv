Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something we could work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000? This product is truly top-of-the-line, and I'm confident you won't regret it."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. How about $14,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $14,500 is a good deal at this point. It exceeds his perceived value and gives me a significant profit. Holding out for a potentially higher offer from Bob risks losing the sale altogether."
