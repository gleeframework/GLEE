{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still significantly exceeding my minimum value of $12,000. I'm confident that if he rejects this offer, his counteroffer will be closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm lowering my price to $14,000, which is still a significant amount above my minimum value. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to give away the product for a drastically reduced price."
