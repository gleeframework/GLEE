"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price.  This shows Bob I'm serious about getting the value I believe the product is worth. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to him while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round, but if I don't get a better offer, I'm starting to consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to Bob's desired price.  I'm hoping this signals my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is now equal to his perceived value of the product. I'm willing to accept this offer as it meets my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have preferred more, it's important to acknowledge that John is a safe option if this negotiation fails."
