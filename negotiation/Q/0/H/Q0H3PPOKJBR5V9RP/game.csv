"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $130. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you.",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. Would you be open to $125?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $135. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you, and it's a bit closer to my original offer.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle and offer $130. This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. It's the minimum price I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to hold firm on this price, but I'm also willing to wait for a better offer. If you're still interested, I'm open to hearing your next offer.",135.0,Alice,5,
