``` 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Price:** $717,500 is a significant saving compared to John's offer of $800,000.
* **Alice's Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her last offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower. 
* **Time Constraint:**  You have limited rounds, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away or running out of time for a better deal with John. 

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether."
