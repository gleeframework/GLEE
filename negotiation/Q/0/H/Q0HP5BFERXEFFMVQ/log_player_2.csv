"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,750,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's a lot of room for negotiation.  It's better to reject and counteroffer to start lowering the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is unfortunately not viable for me, I'm willing to come down to $1250000 to make this deal work. This price still offers you significant value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer of $1,250,000 is still above your maximum budget.  You should continue negotiating to try and get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a limited budget, and I'm eager to make this deal work. However, $1100000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to drop my price to $1200000, which is a significant compromise. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your budget.  You're close to your maximum price, but it's worth trying to see if you can push Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  I'm still a little too high.  How about $1,150,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1150000 is still below my minimum. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1175000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it still represents a good value for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is very close to your maximum budget.  However, it's still above your desired price.  You have two rounds left, but it's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice down to your target price. 

It's more beneficial to buy from John at $1,000,000, as this ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiations.  While you might save a little more by continuing with Alice, the risk of not getting the product at all or having to pay more in the end is too high."
