Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach allows me to potentially earn more than Bob's initial value while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise, but still maintaining a price higher than Bob's initial offer. This approach could lead to a successful negotiation where both parties feel they got a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking $11,000 is a more comfortable price for me. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is still below my minimum desired price, it's getting closer.  Considering the possibility of further negotiation and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether, accepting his offer is the most strategic move at this point."
