"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. Would you be interested in buying it for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price in further negotiations since her product is only worth $80 to her."
