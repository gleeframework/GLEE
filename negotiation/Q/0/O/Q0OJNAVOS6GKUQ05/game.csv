"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product. However, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for it, but I need to see if we can find common ground.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm confident that this product will bring you significant value in the long run. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. My next offer is $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm really pushing the limits of my budget. I'm happy to meet you at $1100000, which is a fair compromise. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're still holding firm on your price, but I'm really struggling to go higher than $1050000. It's my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value of the product. If you're not willing to accept it, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $1080000, which is a compromise that I think is fair. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1080000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $1060000, which is a good compromise for both of us. This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",1060000.0,Bob,8,
