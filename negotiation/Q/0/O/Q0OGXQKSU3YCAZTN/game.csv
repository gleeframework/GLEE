,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $160. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $140? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $20 that I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $155. It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting close to my minimum price.",155.0,Alice,5,
