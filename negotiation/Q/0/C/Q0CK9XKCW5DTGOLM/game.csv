"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but the price is a little high for me at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to settle around $650,000. Would that be acceptable?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $675,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",675000.0,Alice,5,
