"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its potential and worth, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""potential and worth"" to justify the high initial price, framing it as a worthwhile investment for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By calling it a ""starting point,"" I signal my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while leaving space for a deal that's acceptable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I think it's a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. He moved up significantly from his initial perceived value, suggesting he's quite interested. By rejecting and countering, I can try to secure a higher price, even if it's slightly above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. It shows me you're serious about this product.  While I value your business, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. Would you be open to  $1,900,000? I believe this reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm coming down significantly from my initial offer but staying well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming high. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between his willingness to pay ($1,500,000) and my desired profit margin.
* **Positive Language:** By using phrases like ""appreciate your counteroffer"" and ""value your business,"" I maintain a collaborative and positive tone, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to the midpoint between his initial offer and my counter. This suggests he's serious and nearing his maximum price. Accepting $1,700,000 gives me a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of pushing him away by continuing to negotiate. It's a strong deal at this point."
