"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! Given its features and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down closer to that range?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you counteroffering.  While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this product holds value, but $15,000 is still quite high for me. Could we possibly agree on $10,000? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I'm willing to move a bit more. Let's make it $13,500. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate the movement you've made.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
