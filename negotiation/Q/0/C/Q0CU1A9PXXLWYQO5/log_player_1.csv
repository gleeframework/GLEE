I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get close to Bob's valuation of $15,000 without risking him walking away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still below my target price. I'm going to try to get closer to $14,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750} 
```

I'm offering $13,750. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for him to accept, but still leaves a little room for negotiation if he decides to counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Bob's offer of $13,500 is a fair compromise, and it's higher than what I'd get from John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
