"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product delivers a lot of value, and I need to get closer to $13,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this product brings value, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet closer to the middle at $9,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this.  I see where you're coming from, but $9,000 just won't work for me. To make this work, I'd need to be at least at $11,500.  That feels like a fair offer given the value this product provides.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be open to $10,250? That's a pretty significant compromise on my end.",10250.0,Bob,6,
