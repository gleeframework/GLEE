"Round 1

Let's start negotiating!  $14,000 is too high."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product delivers a lot of value, and I need to get closer to $13,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice is coming down, but we're still pretty far apart. Let's see if we can get her closer to $10,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand this product brings value, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet closer to the middle at $9,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this.  I see where you're coming from, but $9,000 just won't work for me. To make this work, I'd need to be at least at $11,500.  That feels like a fair offer given the value this product provides.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

We're getting close! Alice is down to $11,500, but I think we can do a bit better.  Let's see if we can get her closer to $10,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be open to $10,250? That's a pretty significant compromise on my end."",
