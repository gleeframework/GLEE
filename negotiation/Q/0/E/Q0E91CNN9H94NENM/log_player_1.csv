{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives him room to negotiate.  If Bob rejects this offer, we can evaluate his counteroffer and adjust our own to try and maximize our profits. Remember, we can always sell to John for $150 if we don't get a satisfactory price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. We want to get closer to our minimum price of $150. Rejecting his offer gives us a chance to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $95?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to our minimum, we can still do better.  We'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle again. How about $100?  That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
