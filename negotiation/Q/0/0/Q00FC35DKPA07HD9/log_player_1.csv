Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it's of significant value to you, and this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting a price above your minimum:** You know you can sell the product for $80 to John, so your offer to Bob should be higher.
* **Leaving room for negotiation (but not too much):** Offering it at $100 gives Bob a potential discount while still earning you a significant profit.  
* **Highlighting value to Bob:** By mentioning the product's value to Bob, you reinforce his potential gain from the purchase.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price that benefits both parties. If he rejects the offer, you still have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
