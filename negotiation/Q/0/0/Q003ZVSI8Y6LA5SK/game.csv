"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the unique features and benefits this product offers.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price for this product.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10200. This is still a great value for the product, and I think it's worth considering.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $10200. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $10000, which is the same price I can get from John. I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
