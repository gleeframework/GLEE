"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate the excitement around the product's potential value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. This amount still allows me to see a good return on investment while staying within my financial limits.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
