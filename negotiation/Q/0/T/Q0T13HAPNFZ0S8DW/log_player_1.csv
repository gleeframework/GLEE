Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to aim higher with Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** $19,000 creates a strong anchor point for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land above your minimum. 
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message implies that Bob has a limited-time advantage before the product is available to others. This can encourage a quicker decision. 
 
**Important Note:** It's crucial to be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still maximizing your profit."
