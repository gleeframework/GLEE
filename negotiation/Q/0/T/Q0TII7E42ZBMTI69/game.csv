"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  I'm sure we can both agree that this is a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. This is my final offer, I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
