"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let's talk."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate while still earning a significant profit. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price. I have time and John is a guaranteed sale, so I don't need to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000? It's a fair price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still ensuring you get a great deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired price but still within the realm of reason for Bob. I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us to encourage a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is a better offer than the previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a compromise before resorting to selling to John. I've got time, and I'm not giving up easily."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 simply won't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable investment for you, and I'm eager to see it succeed.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm trying to bridge the gap with a slightly lower offer, showing flexibility. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and expressing my desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,250,000, but I'd like to propose $1,300,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my $1,500,000 goal, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is the closest he's come to my minimum value. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing out on this sale entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision at this point."
