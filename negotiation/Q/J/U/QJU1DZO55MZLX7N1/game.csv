"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000? It's a fair price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still ensuring you get a great deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. Can we discuss further?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 simply won't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable investment for you, and I'm eager to see it succeed.  Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,250,000, but I'd like to propose $1,300,000. Can we discuss further?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
