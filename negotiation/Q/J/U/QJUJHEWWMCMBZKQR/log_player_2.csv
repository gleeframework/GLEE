"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is well above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's too early to accept, and I have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,450,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise,  and I'm hopeful we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my target price, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I value your willingness to find a solution, and I'm prepared to adjust my price slightly.  How about we settle at $1,225,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my initial asking price and reflects my desire to see this deal through with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still over my budget.  While we've made progress, I'm running out of rounds, and I'm not sure I can get her down to a price I'm comfortable with.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
