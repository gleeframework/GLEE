"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 to purchase the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial proposal.  I can be flexible, but I can't go as low as $750,000.  Would you consider $875,000? I'm confident this product will bring you a substantial return on that investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept $875,000 for the product. My maximum budget remains at $750,000. However, I am willing to discuss a compromise between our positions. Would $800,000 be acceptable to you?",800000.0,Bob,4,
