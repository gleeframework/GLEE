Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

While ideally, we'd want a price closer to $12,000, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $11,000 is still a $1,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely and having to settle for the $10,000."
