"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting offer, it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation while also ensuring a potential profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can reach a more acceptable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough.  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can come to a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $92.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, it's clear we're not close to a price that meets my minimum value.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $120 and ensure a decent profit.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
