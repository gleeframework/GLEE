"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm confident in the product's potential to bring you a significant return, I could adjust the price to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in your product, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects a fair price that's within my budget and still allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
