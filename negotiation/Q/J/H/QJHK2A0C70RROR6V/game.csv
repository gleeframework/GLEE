"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1000000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $1400000. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the potential growth and value it could bring to my portfolio.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and recognize your budget constraints.  While $1400000 is a step in the right direction, it doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which reflects the product's value and potential for future growth. This price point offers a fair compromise, considering the value you'll gain from owning this unique asset. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $1000000.
