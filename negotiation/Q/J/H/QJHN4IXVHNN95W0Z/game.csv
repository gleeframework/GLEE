"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to come down to $7500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $8250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8250 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
