Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my target value with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to come down to $900,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $850,000 is a good price, above my minimum threshold of $800,000, and it's a good deal for both of us. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round."
