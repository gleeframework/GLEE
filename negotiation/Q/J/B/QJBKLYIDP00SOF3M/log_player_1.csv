Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum desired price of $150.  I'll keep John as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price below my minimum desired value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that it's still a good deal for him considering the value he places on the product.  If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, I've reached a point where I'm comfortable selling the product to John for my desired price. It's not ideal to get my full asking price, but it's a safe and reliable outcome, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a lower price."
