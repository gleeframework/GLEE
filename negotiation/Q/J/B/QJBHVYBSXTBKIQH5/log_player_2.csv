Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. This would still be a good deal for you, as you mentioned the product is worth $8,000 to you.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500.  At this point, it's more beneficial to go with the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
