"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less than $1,500,000 from John, and there's room for negotiation with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This price still represents a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
