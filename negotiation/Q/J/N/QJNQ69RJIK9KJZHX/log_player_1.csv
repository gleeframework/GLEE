Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $80.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with."", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see where you're coming from. $120 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you maybe do $95? That would really help me out.
