,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see where you're coming from. $120 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you maybe do $95? That would really help me out.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
