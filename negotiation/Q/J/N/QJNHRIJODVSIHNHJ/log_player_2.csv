"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but also wants to be realistic.  Offering $900,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  It's a strong starting point for negotiation in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  There are still several rounds left, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a gradual reduction in the price.  Offering $950,000 is a compromise, showing willingness to meet Alice halfway while still leaving room for further negotiation.  It's a good strategy to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually acceptable price."
