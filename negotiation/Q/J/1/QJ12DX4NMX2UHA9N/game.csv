"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
