"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  I'm very serious about this product and want to make sure we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your seriousness about the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
