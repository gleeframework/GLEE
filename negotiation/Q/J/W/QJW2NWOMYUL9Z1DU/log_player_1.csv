Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise between maximizing my potential profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **Higher than John's offer:** This ensures that I'm earning more than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Lower than Bob's perceived value:** There's still room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, making him more likely to accept."
