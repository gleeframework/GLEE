"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price, setting the stage for potential counteroffers. 

**Important Note:** I'm choosing to prioritize maximizing my earnings, but this strategy might risk losing the deal entirely. It's important to balance this with the potential of reaching a compromise with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's initial counteroffer is too far off. I have 8 rounds left and a strong fallback option with John, so I can afford to be more assertive.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price from Bob, even if it takes more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still holding onto a significant profit.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as ""fair,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity and potentially leading to a faster agreement. 
* **Reiterating product value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to encourage him to consider a higher price.

**Next steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll continue to adjust my offers while remaining mindful of my fallback option with John and the remaining rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Remaining rounds:** I have 6 rounds left, and the potential for a better deal with Bob exists. Selling to John would be a guaranteed $15,000, but I believe I can get closer to that amount with Bob.
* **Strategic negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can signal that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my initial offer.

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $10,500. I will continue to be flexible and responsive to his counteroffers, while always keeping my minimum value and fallback option with John in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference again and go with $10,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and it's still significantly less than what I could get elsewhere.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Again, I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's counteroffer ($9,500). This shows a willingness to compromise while still holding onto a significant profit.
* **Emphasizing the benefits:**  I'm highlighting how this price is a ""great deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's rationality and potentially encouraging a faster agreement.
* **Reiterating my fallback option:** By mentioning that I could get a higher price elsewhere, I'm subtly pressuring Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer in the next round, but I will be increasingly mindful of the remaining rounds and my fallback option with John.  I'll continue to be flexible, but also assertive in my negotiation to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to pay $9750 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds:** We are now down to 4 rounds, and the pressure is on to get closer to a satisfactory price.  
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I am still committed to getting a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, likely aiming for something like $10,250 to split the difference again. I'll remain flexible but firm, understanding that I have a guaranteed $15,000 option with John as a backup."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $10,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's still a significant value for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle again:**  I'm continuing the pattern of splitting the difference, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm reframing the offer as ""fair"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at this price, he's getting a good deal.

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider my options. With only 3 rounds left, I'll need to decide if I can push for a higher price or accept his offer, weighing my desired profit against the risk of losing the deal entirely.  I'll also need to remember that I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $10250. I'm willing to pay $9900 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,900 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Limited rounds:** We are down to 2 rounds left, so time is running out. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I'm going to try one more time to get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for something like $10,100. I'll need to be mindful of the limited rounds and decide if I'm willing to risk losing the deal entirely to get a price closer to my desired value."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $9,900 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to go down to $10,100, which is a compromise for both of us. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer, signaling that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm coming down to $10,100, which is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his previous offer. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer and that I will have to move on to another buyer if we don't agree, adding pressure to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept or Reject:**  Bob will either accept this final offer or reject it, ending the negotiation.  
* **Decision Time:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll have one final decision: accept John's offer for $15,000 or walk away from the deal entirely.  I will need to carefully weigh the potential of getting a higher price with Bob in the next round against the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept your offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** This is the final round of negotiation. 
* **Falling Short:**  Bob's offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and secures a much better price than anything Bob is offering. 

**Conclusion:**

While I was willing to negotiate with Bob, his final offer is not close enough to my desired price. It's better to secure the guaranteed profit of $15,000 by selling to John."
