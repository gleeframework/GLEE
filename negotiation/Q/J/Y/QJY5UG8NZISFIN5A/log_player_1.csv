"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product's value is even higher in your mind.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price, even if general, can make it seem more reasonable to the buyer.
* **Open Communication:**  Phrases like ""What are your thoughts?"" invite Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum.  You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and the option to sell to John acts as a strong safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but the value of this product is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I believe this price reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** By reducing the price by $100,000, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. However, you're still holding firm to a price significantly above Bob's offer and your minimum. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This common negotiation tactic can feel like a fair compromise to both parties, even if the initial starting points were far apart.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  Continue to emphasize the product's value to keep Bob engaged and potentially willing to pay more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, and I think that's a fair compromise. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his initial offer, showing reluctance to move significantly. We still have time on our side and the guarantee of John's offer. It's strategically advantageous to continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but $1,200,000 is simply too low to justify parting with this product. However, I value your interest and I'm willing to make a significant move.  My final offer is $1,275,000. This offer reflects the absolute lowest I can go."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  Introducing this as your ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes that you're nearing the limit of your flexibility.
* **Justification:**  Even though you're making a concession, reiterating that it's the lowest you can go strengthens your position.
* **Strategic Compromise:** The price of $1,275,000 is a significant move from your previous offer, but it still provides you with a substantial profit over John's offer and is closer to your desired outcome.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you might consider accepting his price in the next round or selling to John. Holding out much longer could risk losing both opportunities if Bob is unwilling to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,220,000, and I think that's the best we can do. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer of $1,220,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer in smaller increments.  It's unlikely he'll suddenly agree to a price significantly closer to your target.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only four rounds remaining, the risk of Bob walking away and losing both offers increases.
* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,220,000 is still a significant profit margin. Holding out for a slightly higher price from Bob isn't worth the potential loss of the entire deal."
