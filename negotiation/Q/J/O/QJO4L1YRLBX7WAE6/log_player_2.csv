"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $8,500 is a good deal, there's a chance Bob can get it for even less. By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore further negotiation with Alice and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and sets a starting point for further discussions. The $7,000 offer leaves room for compromise and allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,200 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and secure a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $7,500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below Alice's latest offer.  It's a strategic move to test Alice's flexibility and potentially find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,100 is now closer to Bob's desired price range. It's likely that further negotiation will result in minor price adjustments, but the time constraint of 10 rounds and the availability of the product for $10,000 from John makes this offer a good compromise. Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,900 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable outcome considering the negotiation progress."
