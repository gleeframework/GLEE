Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run. I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Offering it at $1,100,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still making it a very attractive deal for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong starting point, there might be room for Bob to counter-offer, pushing the price slightly higher.
* **Considering the Alternative:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. This offer to Bob aims to secure a much higher profit."
