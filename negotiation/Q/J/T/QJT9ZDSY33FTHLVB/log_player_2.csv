"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$1,000,000 is a good price, but it's still possible to get it lower.**  Since you have a fallback option with John, there's no need to rush into accepting the first offer.
* **Negotiation can lead to better savings.**  By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you can test the waters and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $100,000 reduction is a significant step, but it's still within a reasonable range, showing Alice you're serious about buying but also value a good deal.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further and potentially reveal her desired price range. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you can adjust your counteroffer in the next round based on her reaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and $950,000 is a good price that saves you $50,000 compared to John's price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or becoming less willing to negotiate. 
* **Time factor:**  With 7 rounds remaining, accepting this offer is a good way to secure the product at a reasonable price while leaving room for potential future negotiations if needed."
