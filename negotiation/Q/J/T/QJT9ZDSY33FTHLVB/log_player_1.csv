"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to play ball. If he rejects, I'll adjust based on his counteroffer and the number of rounds remaining.  I'm always aware of the fallback option with John, but I want to maximize my earnings!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is tempting, I believe I can get a better price. I have 8 rounds left and the fallback option with John is always there. I'll counteroffer and see where we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also leaving some room for further negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to bridge the gap."
