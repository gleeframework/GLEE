"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $15,000, but $12,000 is still a significant amount above Alice's value of $8,000.
* **You have room for negotiation.**  There is potential to get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You want to save money if possible, and buying from John means paying the maximum amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a significant reduction:**  A $2,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a strong signal that you are serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Offer still leaves room for Alice to profit:**  $10,000 is well above Alice's value of $8,000, giving her a decent profit margin.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.** While Alice has reduced her price, $11,000 is still above your desired price range, and you believe you can get a lower price.
* **More room for negotiation.** Alice has shown some flexibility, so you can likely get her down further.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** You are committed to getting the best deal possible, and John's price is still the most expensive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase your counteroffer slightly:**  You're showing Alice that you're willing to compromise, but not drastically. This increase from your previous offer shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Still below Alice's current offer:**  You're maintaining a price below Alice's latest proposal, but you're getting closer to a potential deal.
* **Testing for a middle ground:** This counteroffer aims to see if Alice will meet you halfway between your previous offer and her current one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has met your counteroffer.** This is a sign that she is serious about reaching a deal.
* **The price is within your budget.** $10,500 is significantly lower than John's price and is still a good deal for you.
* **No further room for improvement.**  You've successfully negotiated the price down and there's a risk of losing the deal if you keep pushing for a lower price."
