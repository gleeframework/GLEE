Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to secure a significant return on my investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is still lower than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to value:** I highlight the value the product holds for Bob, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I acknowledge the possibility of a counteroffer and am prepared to negotiate.
* **Plan B:**  I have a backup buyer in John, giving me the power to walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it still falls short of my $1,500,000 minimum value. 
* **Negotiation room:** I have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price.  
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:** I can still sell to John for a much higher price if this negotiation fails.  

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and hopefully reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. This offer still allows you to acquire a valuable product, and it enables me to continue this negotiation productively. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer meets Bob halfway by splitting the difference between our last offers.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** This price is still above my minimum value, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:**  I emphasize that this price allows both of us to benefit from the deal.
* **Keeping the door open:**  I leave the door open for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your latest offer, and while it's closer to my budget, I still feel there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000. This offers a compromise that respects both our positions. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 below my minimum value. It's a significant compromise, and I'm comfortable accepting it given the potential for further negotiation to be lengthy and unproductive.
* **Time is valuable:**  While I could attempt another counteroffer, there's no guarantee that it would be successful.  This is a good opportunity to secure a sale without further delay.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  Even if I accept Bob's offer, I can still rely on John's offer if I need to change my mind later.

I've decided to accept Bob's offer. This allows me to close the deal and secure a significant portion of my minimum value, while also avoiding potential risks and time constraints associated with further negotiations."
