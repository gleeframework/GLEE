"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1,500,000. Considering our mutual interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can save at least $100,000 by counter-offering. It's worth exploring if he can get a better deal from Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's already saved $150,000 from the initial price, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result. There's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation risk."
