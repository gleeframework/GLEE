# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,001, which is a very competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. This way, you'll be getting a great deal, and I'll be happy to finalize the sale with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001.

Even though Alice is offering a price just $1 above your maximum value, it's still more expensive than buying from John. You should reject the offer and purchase from John to save $1."
