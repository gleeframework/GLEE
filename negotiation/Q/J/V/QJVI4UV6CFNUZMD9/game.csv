"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $130 for it.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $135.  Let's see if we can make this work!",135.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $128 for the product.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $128 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $132?  It's closer to your price and still fair for me.",132.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I'm getting closer to your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $129 is a good price for you, but it's not enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $130.  This is my final offer, and I think it's fair for both of us.",130.0,Alice,7,
