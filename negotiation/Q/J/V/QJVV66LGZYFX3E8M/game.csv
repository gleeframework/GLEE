"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $200 might be a bit high, but $80 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? ",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $110.  Would you be willing to do $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $125 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go to $100, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",100.0,Bob,6,
