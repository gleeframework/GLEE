Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $200 might be a bit high, but $80 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $110.  Would you be willing to do $125? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $125 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go to $100, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $150. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
