Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your specific needs, potentially worth far more to you in the long run. I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John offers a safety net at $800,000, Bob values the product much higher at $1,500,000.  Our goal is to secure as much of that potential profit as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,200,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $300,000 discount from his perceived value, and we secure a $400,000 profit over John's offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer doesn't have to be the final price. It leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to an even better deal while staying above our minimum threshold."
