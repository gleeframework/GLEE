Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves some room for negotiation while still giving me a profit above my minimum of $80. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $100 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $90. This shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I hope this counteroffer will be agreeable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, and it is above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  To avoid further negotiation, I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $87."
