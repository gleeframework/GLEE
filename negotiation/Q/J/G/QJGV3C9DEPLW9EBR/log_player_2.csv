"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I know you'd be happy with it. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than your absolute limit of $15,000. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or move on to John's offer, which is your upper limit."
