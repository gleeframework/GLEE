"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,550,000. This reflects the product's value to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $1,550,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,525,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it allows us both to close a deal.  Let's make it happen.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
