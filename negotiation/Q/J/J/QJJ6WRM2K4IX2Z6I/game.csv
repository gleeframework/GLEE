"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $108 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $112. This is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",112.0,Alice,5,
