"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value may be even higher for you at $150. I would like to propose a deal: you can purchase this exceptional product for $125. This price reflects the value I place on it while ensuring you receive a great deal considering its worth to you. I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $125 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and also less than buying from John for $150. This is a good deal for you!"
