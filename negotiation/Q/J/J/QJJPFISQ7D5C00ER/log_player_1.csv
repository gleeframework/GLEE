"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm not going to accept an offer that's significantly below my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'm proposing $1,050,000. This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to my budget. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm offering a final compromise of $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  If you're serious about buying, this is the best offer I can make."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been tough but fair in this negotiation. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000 even though that cuts into my potential profit, I recognize the value of this product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is $1,000,000, which is the same amount I can get from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob as I'm not going to get a higher price from him. It's better to close the deal with John now."
