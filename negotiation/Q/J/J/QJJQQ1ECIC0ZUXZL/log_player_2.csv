**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we've reached a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer and your alternative option (buying from John for $1,000,000).  While you might be able to push Alice a little further, the potential savings are likely minimal compared to the risk of her accepting a smaller offer later."
