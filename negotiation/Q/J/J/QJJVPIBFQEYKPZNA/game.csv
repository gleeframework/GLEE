"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product for $20000. I think it's a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $10000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $10000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is my last compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
