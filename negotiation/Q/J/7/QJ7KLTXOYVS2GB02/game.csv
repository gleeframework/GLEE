"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $97.50? Can you accept that price?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $102.50. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",102.5,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",98.0,Bob,8,
