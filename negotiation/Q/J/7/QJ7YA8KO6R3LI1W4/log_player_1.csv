``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a higher price, but I'm also being reasonable.  I'm open to counteroffers, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary.  John is a safety net, ensuring I can always get at least $1,000,000 for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.  John is always a backup, but I'd rather get closer to the $1,200,000 I initially aimed for."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,050,000?  That's still a fair price, and it gives us both room to make a deal. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still not high enough. I'm going to counteroffer again.  I'm getting closer to John's price, so I might be willing to accept something closer to $1,000,000 if Bob doesn't budge much more."
