Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. It's worth $100 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $90."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I could start at $100, offering $90 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal, potentially avoiding a rejection. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $80 gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately lowball the price."
