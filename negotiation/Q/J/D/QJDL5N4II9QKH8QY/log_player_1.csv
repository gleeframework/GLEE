Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I can start with a significantly higher offer. This creates room for negotiation and potentially allows me to capture more of the value.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it implies exclusivity and high value, aiming to anchor Bob's perception at a higher level. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open to discussion (""What are your thoughts?""), signaling I might be willing to negotiate if Bob pushes back. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while considering the guaranteed backup offer from John."
