"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can potentially get the product for a lower price than $12,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to save money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $10,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $11,500.

You're still better off trying to get a lower price. You've shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, so she's likely to be more flexible.  A counteroffer gives you the opportunity to potentially reach a price closer to your target of $10,000."

Alice is now offering a price that's closer to her value than yours. It's unlikely she'll go lower, and you're risking the negotiation dragging on. It's more advantageous to buy from John for a guaranteed price, even if it's slightly higher."
