{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for the highest possible price, but not being unreasonable.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a terrible deal.
* **It's a strong opening:** It signals that you are confident in the product's value and are willing to negotiate.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to maintain a good relationship with Bob if possible.  Be prepared to adjust your offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000.  This product is worth $1,000,000 to me, so a price in the middle would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  You've already established that the product is worth significantly more to Bob than your minimum.  By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:** Show Bob that you're not desperate to sell.
* **Try for a higher price:** A counteroffer from you could lead to a mutually agreeable price. 

You can counteroffer with a price slightly above Bob's offer, keeping in mind you want to maximize your profit while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is fair for both of us and ensures we can both benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you are willing to compromise, but not at the expense of your desired profit margin.
* **Justification:** You provide a reason for your counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product to both parties.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message still leaves the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $875,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to each of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is only $25,000 less than your previous counteroffer of $900,000.  This is a very small difference, and it's worth accepting to close the deal.

Here's why:

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag things out and risk Bob walking away completely.
* **Close to your minimum:**  $875,000 is still well above your minimum of $800,000.
* **Potential for future deals:**  A successful negotiation now could lead to future business opportunities with Bob. 

While you might be able to push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer at this point is the most sensible decision."
