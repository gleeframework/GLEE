"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,750. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal. Let me know if you're interested.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,750, which would be $13,125. Can you consider that?",13125.0,Bob,4,
