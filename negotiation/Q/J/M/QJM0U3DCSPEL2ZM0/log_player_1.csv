Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return you stand to gain.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your desired outcome. This leaves room for potential negotiation while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price and pique Bob's interest. 
* **Exclusivity Tactic:** By mentioning other buyers, Alice creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initial proposal"" and the question ""What are your thoughts?"" show Alice is open to discussing the price further, making Bob feel more in control.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a reason to accept a price significantly higher than his perceived value."
