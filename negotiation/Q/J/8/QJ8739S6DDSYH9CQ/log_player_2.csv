"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is $100. 
* You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.
* You still have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that's lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum value ($80). 
* This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and gives Alice room to counter if she wants to.
* I have 8 rounds left, so I can still negotiate if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $95 is still below my maximum price of $120.
* I have 7 rounds left to negotiate, but I'm not sure if I can get a better price.  
* Accepting the offer will save me $25 compared to buying from John."
