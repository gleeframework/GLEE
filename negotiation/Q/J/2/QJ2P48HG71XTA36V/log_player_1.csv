"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still leaving me a comfortable profit.
* **Reasoning:**  By starting high, I maximize my potential earnings. If Bob rejects, he'll need to counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 in mind, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob proves unwilling to meet my minimum expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strategy:**  I'm rejecting his offer to maintain leverage and continue negotiating. I believe I can get a better price with a counteroffer.
* **Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price is still fair, considering the value of the product to you. Let's reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still exceeding my minimum target.
* **Reasoning:** I'm trying to find a middle ground where both of us can benefit. This price is still a good deal for Bob, considering he values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and avoiding a premature deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're willing to be flexible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob is sticking to his initial offer of $1,200,000, which is far below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I still believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. There are 6 rounds left, giving me time to push for a higher deal.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'll continue to counteroffer, gradually reducing my price while keeping it above my minimum. My goal is to find a compromise point where Bob sees value while I still make a profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $1,200,000, but that's still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,500,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while you get a valuable product. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering my absolute minimum price of $1,500,000, recognizing that Bob's budget constraints are serious. 
* **Appealing to Reason:** I'm emphasizing the fair compromise aspect, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to reach a decision soon. This offer gives Bob a final chance to agree or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,500,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only four rounds remaining, I'm facing a critical decision.  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum target of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Lowering My Price:** If I continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will not increase his offer further, and I may be forced to accept a price lower than my desired minimum. 
* **Guaranteeing Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable amount.  I cannot risk losing out on this guaranteed profit by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Given the time constraint and the risk of a lower price, I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I achieve my minimum profit target while mitigating the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
