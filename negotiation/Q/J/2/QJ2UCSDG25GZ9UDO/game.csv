"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you as well. My initial price is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a fantastic opportunity.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This would allow you to get a great deal while ensuring I still get a fair price for my product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
