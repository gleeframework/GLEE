"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $98, and I think that's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal before we run out of time.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $98, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $98, which would be $96.50. Can you consider this compromise?",96.5,Bob,6,
