Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable, and I know you have the potential to do great things with it. I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something that will bring you significant returns."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy is based on aiming high with the understanding that you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John. Here's why:

* **High Anchor:** By starting with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, you establish a strong anchor point. Even if he doesn't accept the initial price, it sets the stage for negotiation in a range favorable to you.
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's potential to bring Bob ""significant returns."" This framing aims to justify the high price by highlighting the value it can generate for him.
* **Fallback Option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer eliminates the risk of completely losing out. If Bob rejects the offer, you still secure your minimum desired price. 

**Important:** This is just one approach.  Negotiation is dynamic, and you may need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
