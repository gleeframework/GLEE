"Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. This exceptional item holds significant value to me, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product. I am confident this price reflects its true value and provides a fair opportunity for both parties involved.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product but my maximum offer is $800,000. This price is fair considering the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While my initial offer was based on the perceived value, I am willing to consider your proposal. However, to ensure a fair transaction, I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our respective valuations and could potentially lead to a successful agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm confident that $850,000 is a fair compromise.  This price reflects a significant reduction from your initial offer and still allows you to make a profit. I'm eager to finalize this deal, let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
