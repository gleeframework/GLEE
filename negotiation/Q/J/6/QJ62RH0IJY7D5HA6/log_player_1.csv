"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a bold opening move, but it's important to establish a high baseline and leave room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, we can then gauge his interest and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. However, it's still above my minimum price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering Bob's initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that's less than $1,500,000. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to come closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,600,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of rounds. It's a gamble whether he'll come up to my price or not.  To avoid the risk of losing out completely, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,500,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a decent profit and guarantees a sale."
