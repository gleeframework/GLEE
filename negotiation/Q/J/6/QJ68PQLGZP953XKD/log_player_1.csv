{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point that balances a few key factors:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate, potentially increasing the price.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you're still making a profit and provides flexibility for negotiation.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also showing that you value your product.

This initial offer gives Bob the opportunity to accept, reject, or counter-offer, keeping the negotiation process open and dynamic."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,250,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,150,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for less than my minimum.  I need to see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price slightly, but I'm standing firm at $1,200,000.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also committed to getting as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,200,000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's persistence at $1,100,000 is pushing me too close to my minimum acceptable value.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, especially with John offering a guaranteed $1,500,000.  It's time to secure the sale with John."
