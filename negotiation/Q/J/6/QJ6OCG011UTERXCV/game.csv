"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 to me. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be worth $120 to you. Would you like to proceed with this offer?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $120 to me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I respect your valuation of the product. Given the value I place on it, I am willing to lower my asking price to $105. This still allows me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. Would you consider this offer?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your effort to find a fair price, Bob. Considering the cost of production and the value I see in the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My revised offer is $95 for the product. I hope this meets your budget while still allowing me to cover my expenses. Please let me know if this works for you.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $95 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",92.5,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $90 for the product.
