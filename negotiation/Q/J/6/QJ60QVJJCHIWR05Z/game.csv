"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,400,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, which would be $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my commitment to purchasing it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but your offer is getting too far away from the true value of this product.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. ",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous offer, which would be $1,325,000.
