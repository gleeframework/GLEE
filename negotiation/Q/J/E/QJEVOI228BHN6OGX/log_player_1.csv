Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing she has John as a backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,999 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still staying above Alice's minimum price. 
* **Urgency and Value:**  The message implies value to Bob and a sense of urgency to make a decision."
