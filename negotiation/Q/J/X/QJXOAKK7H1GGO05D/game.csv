"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my price point.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $97.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle on $101.25? It's a fair price for both of us.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $101.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $99, but no more. Can you meet me at that price?",99.0,Bob,6,
