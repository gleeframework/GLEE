Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $175 is a 16.67% markup from your minimum, which is a reasonable starting point in negotiations.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests you're open to discussion, allowing Bob to feel like he can potentially negotiate the price down. 

By starting high, you give yourself room to negotiate down if needed, while maximizing your chances of getting a price closer to your desired outcome."
