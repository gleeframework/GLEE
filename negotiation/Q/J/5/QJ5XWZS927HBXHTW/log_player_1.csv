Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

My reasoning:

* **Maximize Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $100, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price of $80.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering it at $90 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, while still securing a good profit for me.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob."
