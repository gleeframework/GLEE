Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to a budget, but $9,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one last compromise.  If you're serious about buying this product, let's meet in the middle at $10,000.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
