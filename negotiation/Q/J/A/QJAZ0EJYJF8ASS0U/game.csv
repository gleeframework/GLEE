"Alice, your product looks great, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $13,000. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'd see a good return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
