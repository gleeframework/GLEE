Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, I've had several rounds of negotiation and I'm getting close to my minimum. I also want to avoid potentially getting stuck with a lower price from John. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and keeps me from risking a lower price."
