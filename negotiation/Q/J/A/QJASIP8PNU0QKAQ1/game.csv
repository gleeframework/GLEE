"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000, which still reflects the product's value and provides you with a significant benefit. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
