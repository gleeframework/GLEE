{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and think it's worth at least $120.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his negotiating range and can adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I'm only willing to pay up to $100 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value for the product. I'm confident I can get a better price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at this price? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I still can't go above $100 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to budge from $100.  While I'd like to earn more, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with him and potentially risk losing out entirely. I'll sell to John for $100, which is at least my minimum value for the product."
