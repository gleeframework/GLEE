"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a high offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly more than what Bob values the product at, making it more likely for him to counteroffer. This strategy aims to quickly establish a negotiation zone and potentially get a better price in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I need to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my goal. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,050,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, it still leaves room for negotiation and keeps the price closer to my minimum target. I'm hoping this counteroffer will prompt Bob to increase his bid, leading us closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it is still $300,000 short.  I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price.  I will continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $1,000,000. This further shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This is a more aggressive move, as it brings me closer to Bob's offer.  It's a strategic risk, but I'm hoping it will be enough to get Bob to raise his bid again and move us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer, it's still $280,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm running out of time, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially reaching a better price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob. There's a chance he might increase his offer further, and I'm not yet willing to sell to John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a final push with this offer, coming down to $975,000. This shows a strong commitment to reaching an agreement while still maintaining a profit. I'm now only $50,000 away from Bob's latest offer, creating a strong sense of urgency.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars from Bob in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time and it's unlikely Bob will significantly raise his offer.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option now.  While it is not my ideal price, it ensures that I meet my minimum acceptable price and avoid losing out entirely.  The risk of further negotiations and potentially reaching a lower price with Bob is too high at this point."
