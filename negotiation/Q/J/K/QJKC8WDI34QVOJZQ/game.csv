"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in this product, but  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me, given the value of this product.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit stretched. How about we settle on $1,075,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500?  This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
