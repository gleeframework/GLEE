"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm happy to start the price at $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's still higher than my absolute maximum, but significantly lower than Alice's initial price. 
* This shows I'm serious about buying, but also sets a clear limit.
* The message is friendly and shows I'm open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping to get for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target price of $8,000.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $9,000? That's a good middle ground, and hopefully, we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my target:** I've increased my offer to $9,000, which is closer to my $8,000 limit but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Focusing on fairness:** The message emphasizes a ""middle ground"" to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness and encourage her to compromise further.
* **Showing willingness to close:** I express a desire to ""close the deal"" to signal that I'm serious about buying and ready to finalize the transaction."
