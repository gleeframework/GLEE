# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire a product that I believe would greatly benefit you and align with your needs and aspirations. This remarkable item carries a significant value to me, reflecting its unique qualities and the effort invested in its creation. After careful consideration, I propose to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000. I am confident this price reflects the true worth of the product while also providing you with a valuable addition to your collection or endeavors. Please let me know if you require any further information or if you wish to discuss this offer in more detail. I look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, it makes more sense for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John at the lower price."
