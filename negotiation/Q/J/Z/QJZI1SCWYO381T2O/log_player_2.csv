{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product,  $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. However, I can't accept a price as low as $850,000.  Would you consider $890,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is significantly better than John's price of $1,000,000 and is within Bob's budget. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a good chance that Alice might not budge further. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing out to another buyer."
