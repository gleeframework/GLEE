"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product,  $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. However, I can't accept a price as low as $850,000.  Would you consider $890,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",890000.0,Alice,3,
