"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $10,000 is significantly less than what I can let it go for. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's true value.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet closer to the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from. How about we settle on $13,500? That's my final offer.",13500.0,Alice,5,
