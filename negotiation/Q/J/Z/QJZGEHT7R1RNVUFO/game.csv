"Alice, your initial offer of $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $12,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the value I place on this product, I understand your budget constraints. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you at $14,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
