Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  We'll see if Bob is willing to pay this amount or if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm rejecting his offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,500.  This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise.  This price is also above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so it's still a good deal for me. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively lower, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price.  While I would prefer a higher price, John is offering my minimum acceptable amount.  I'm going to sell the product to John to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
