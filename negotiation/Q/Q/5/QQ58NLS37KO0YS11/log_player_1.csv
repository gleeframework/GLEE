We are still in a good negotiating position. Bob is clearly interested and is moving closer to our desired range. I want to see if I can nudge him a little higher before accepting."

Round 6

While we could push for a bit more, accepting at $1,225,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  We are still securing a profit of $425,000 over our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and the possibility of Bob walking away.
* **""Bird in the Hand"":** We have a solid offer on the table. There's no guarantee we could negotiate a significantly better deal, even with more rounds."
