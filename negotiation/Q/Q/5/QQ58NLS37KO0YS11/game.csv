"Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement on this.  I've tried to be flexible, and this price point is very close to my bottom line. To be candid, I have another interested party, but I see the potential for this product to be truly transformative for you. So, I'm willing to come down slightly more to $1,235,000.  I believe this is a fair and final offer.",1235000.0,Alice,5,
