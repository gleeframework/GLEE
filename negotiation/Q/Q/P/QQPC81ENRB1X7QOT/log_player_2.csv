Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer to show his seriousness about getting a good deal. He's offering $900,000, which is $50,000 less than Alice's offer. This shows he's willing to negotiate but also believes the product is worth less than Alice's initial price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $956,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $956,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, Alice's offer is close enough to Bob's desired price range that it's worth accepting.  While he could potentially keep negotiating, the risk is that Alice will raise her price again, or he might run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget, and it's a better deal than buying from John."
