"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $11500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to his desired price point, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price. By rejecting the offer, he can continue the negotiation and see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering $11750. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering $11,750, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  He has already made several counteroffers, and it seems Alice is not willing to go lower than $11,500. With only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a significant price drop.  It's now more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at $10,000 and guarantee the purchase within his budget."
