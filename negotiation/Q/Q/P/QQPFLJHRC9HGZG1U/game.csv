"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $1,000,000 is still quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $800,000 for this product. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",800000.0,Alice,3,
