"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly above your maximum price. You have plenty of room to negotiate and should try to get closer to your target price. Buying from John right now would be settling for your absolute maximum without even trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $1,000,000 is still quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it's still within a reasonable range for negotiation.  It leaves room for you to come up in price while aiming for a significant saving.
* **Polite and Positive:**  The message keeps the tone polite and collaborative, emphasizing your interest in the product while clearly stating your budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $800,000 for this product. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially losing the deal, especially since you can't get a better price from John."
