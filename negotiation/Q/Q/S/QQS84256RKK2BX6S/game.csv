"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's worth to you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,500,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to start at $900,000, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, so let's see if you can meet me here.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're both getting close to a point where we can make this deal work. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is closer to your position while still keeping me within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal this round.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,080,000. This is the last time I'll be willing to budge, so let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
