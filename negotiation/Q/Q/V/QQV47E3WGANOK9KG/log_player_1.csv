Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.

Offering the product at $119 gives Bob a chance to get it for $19 less than his perceived value while still netting you a $19 profit. This is a better outcome than selling it to John for $120."
