"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I'm eager to make a deal, $12,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $11,500 is cutting it close to my bottom line.  I could let it go for $12,500.  This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

"Bob, it seems like we're hitting a bit of an impasse. I'm willing to compromise, but I need you to meet me closer to my price.  How about $11,750?  This offer stands until the end of the next round.",11750.0,Alice,7,
