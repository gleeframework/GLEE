"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and we're looking to share the value. For this opportunity, I propose a price of $75. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $75 is a good deal for Bob. It's below Bob's maximum budget of $80, and it's also a fair price considering the product is worth $80 to Alice.  There's no reason to risk a counteroffer and potentially lose the deal, especially since John is selling the product for the full $80."
