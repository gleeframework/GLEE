"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,800 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,200? It's a fair price that gets us both closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,800 and $8,200, which would be $7,950. Can you consider my offer?",7950.0,Bob,6,
