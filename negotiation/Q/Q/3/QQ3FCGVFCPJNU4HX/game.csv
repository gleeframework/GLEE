"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the special deal, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $120 for it right now.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $135 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that? ",135.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $150. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,
