"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for a product worth so much more. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, but I'm looking to spend no more than $12,000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget. However, $12,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,250?  This reflects a good compromise and allows us to close this deal.",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about compromise.  $12,250 is closer, but I'm still losing money at that price.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer it to you for $12,375.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",12375.0,Alice,5,
