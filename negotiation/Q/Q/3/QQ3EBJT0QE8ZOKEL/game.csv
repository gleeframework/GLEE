"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to acquire this product for a more competitive price. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1150000.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1150000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for you. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1200000?  This would still represent a good profit for you and is the highest I'm prepared to go at this point.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
