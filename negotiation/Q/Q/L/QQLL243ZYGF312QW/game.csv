"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows you to get a great deal. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,150,000. That way, we can both get a good deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows you to stay within a reasonable budget. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
