"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This reflects the value I know it holds, while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, it's not quite where I need to be. Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This allows for a healthy margin for you and ensures I can move forward with this transaction. Let me know if this works for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000. Would that be workable?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue discussing this. While I value your perspective,  $1,150,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
