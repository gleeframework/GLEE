Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a strategic opening offer. It's above your minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation, knowing that Bob values the product at $150. This sets a high starting point and allows for potential concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, it's still lower than your desired profit margin.  It's worth pushing for a higher price, especially since Bob clearly sees value in the product.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still worth pushing for a slightly higher price. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and there's still a good chance he'll accept a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $105 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $90 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $80. However, the negotiation has been lengthy and there's a chance Bob will continue to push for a lower price. To avoid further negotiation, it's more efficient to accept John's offer of $80 and move on."
