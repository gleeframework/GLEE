"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe holds significant potential for you.  I'm confident its worth is well above $1200000. To demonstrate my confidence, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This represents a substantial potential upside for you, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value. Let me know if you're interested in exploring this further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
