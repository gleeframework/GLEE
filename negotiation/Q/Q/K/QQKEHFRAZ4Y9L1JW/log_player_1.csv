"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation. I am hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I am not willing to accept such a low price.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is still a good price for me, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I am hoping this is a more acceptable number for Bob."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,600,000. I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, but I'm still holding out for a better price.  We're getting closer, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to settle for less than $1,500,000, especially since John is willing to pay that.  I will counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession on my part, as I'm very close to my minimum. I'm hoping this is a good compromise that Bob will accept.  I'm confident that Bob can see the value in the product and is willing to pay a fair price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer in the next round.  John is a guaranteed buyer, and I'm confident that I can find a better deal with someone else later."
