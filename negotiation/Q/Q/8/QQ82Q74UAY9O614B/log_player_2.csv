"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You can get the product for a lower price.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to pay less and open the door for a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  If negotiation fails, you have a backup plan to purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While it's closer to my target, $900,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable.**  $950,000 is a good price for you, saving you $250,000 compared to buying from John.
* **There's risk in further negotiation.**  Alice has already moved closer to your desired price, and there's no guarantee she'll budge further.
* **Accepting avoids the risk of losing the deal.**  If you continue to reject, Alice might become less willing to negotiate, or you might reach a point where you're better off buying from John."
