Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. It's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation.  If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to counter-offer if it seems like a deal can be reached.  But I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if things don't go well with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to reach a compromise. I'm also prepared to sell to John if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, which is a bit lower than my initial offer but still a good price for Bob considering he's willing to pay $120. I believe this price is fair and gives us both a good deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to keep going back and forth in negotiation. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so it's the most logical choice."
