{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly get Alice closer to my target price.  A $200,000 drop from her initial offer is aggressive, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my target.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  There's still room for compromise and I want to avoid having to purchase from John at his higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about a deal but still within my budget.  A $100,000 increase feels like a reasonable compromise to potentially get a deal quickly without needing more rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get the price down even further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again raising my offer slightly, but keeping it below $1,000,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about a deal but am unwilling to go beyond my limit.  With only four rounds remaining, I'm hoping this will push Alice closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally met my target price of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity by continuing to negotiate. Even if I could potentially get a lower price in future rounds, there's no guarantee, and I might end up having to buy from John at $1,000,000 anyway.  It's time to secure the deal."
