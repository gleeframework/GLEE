Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good compromise:** It's higher than Bob's valuation of $12,000, allowing me to make some profit, but it's also lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **The message is friendly and persuasive:** I highlight the deal aspect for Bob while still expressing my willingness to accept the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of selling to Bob while still securing a good price. If he rejects the offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum desired price."
