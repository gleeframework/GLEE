I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is at my minimum value.  I'm going to try to get a better price in the next round by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It's still a good price for me, but it shows that I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer is $1,000 higher than what John would pay.  It's not the price I was initially hoping for, but it's a decent profit and I'm not sure how much more negotiation will get me.  It's time to accept and finalize the sale."
