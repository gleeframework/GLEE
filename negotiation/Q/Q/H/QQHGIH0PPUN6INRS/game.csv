"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $15,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
