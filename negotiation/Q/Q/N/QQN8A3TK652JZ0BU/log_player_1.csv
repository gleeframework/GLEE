Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum acceptable price:** I need to earn at least $12,000, so that's my starting point.
* **Potential for higher profit:** I don't know Bob's valuation, but I'm hoping to get more than my minimum. Offering $15,000 gives me a decent margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob.
* **Risk mitigation:**  If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $12,000 from John, so there's no risk of losing money.

This approach balances maximizing profit with minimizing risk."
