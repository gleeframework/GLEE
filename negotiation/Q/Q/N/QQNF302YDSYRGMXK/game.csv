"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be open to $9,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise.",9200.0,Alice,5,
