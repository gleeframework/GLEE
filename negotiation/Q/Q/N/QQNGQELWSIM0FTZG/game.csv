"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. How about $10,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've suggested. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $11,500? This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
