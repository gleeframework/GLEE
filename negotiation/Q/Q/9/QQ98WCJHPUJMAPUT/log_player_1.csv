Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $18,000, which reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I value the product at.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you be willing to do $12,500? That's a significant discount from my original asking price."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there. While I appreciate you coming down in price, $12,500 is still too high. I'm willing to go to $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $11,000.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk Bob walking away altogether."
