"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14,500. Can we meet in the middle on this one?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and offer the product for $15,500. This is my final offer, so please consider it carefully. ",15500.0,Alice,5,
