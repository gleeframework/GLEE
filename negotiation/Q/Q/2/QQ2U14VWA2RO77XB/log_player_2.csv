"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is highly valued by many of our customers. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Would you like to purchase it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is Bob's maximum, it's not a great starting point. There's a good chance Alice is willing to negotiate down from that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Let me see if I can adjust the price to meet your needs. How about $110 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's maximum, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice will go lower before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $105? That's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your feedback, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $107 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $107, which is a good price considering Bob's maximum is $120.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but the odds of getting a lower price from Alice are not great. It's better to secure the product now at a good price rather than risk losing it to John or getting stuck with a lower price in the future."
