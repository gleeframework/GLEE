"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $13,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $14,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a bit of room to compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on $13,500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, and offer $13,750.  Let's close this deal!",13750.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're close, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time and offer $13,625. It's a fair price for both of us, and let's get this done. What do you say?",13625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,625. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",13500.0,Bob,8,
