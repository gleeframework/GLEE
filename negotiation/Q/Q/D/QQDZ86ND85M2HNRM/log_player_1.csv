Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  $13,000 is a little too low for me.  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still hoping to get closer to $14,000, and I think there's still room for negotiation. If I can't get a better price, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell to John.  I've reached a point where it's clear that Bob and I are not going to come to an agreement that works for both of us.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John for $12,000 is still a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and possibly ending up with nothing."
