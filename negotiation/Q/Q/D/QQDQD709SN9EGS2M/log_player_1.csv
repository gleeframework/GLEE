Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John guarantees $1,500,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($1,450,000) creates a strong incentive for him to buy. He gets a good deal ($50,000 less than his perceived value), and you maximize your potential profit.
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit adds urgency and discourages Bob from stalling or trying to negotiate a lower price.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible return while still having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
