"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me. Could you consider $750,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'll offer you the product for $800,000, which is still a discount from the original price. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.
