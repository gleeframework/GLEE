"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

I can offer to provide some consulting services worth $50,000 to help you with the product's implementation. Would you be open to considering this revised offer?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
