Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, but I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I can offer to provide some consulting services worth $50,000 to help you with the product's implementation. Would you be open to considering this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the consulting services add some value, they are not as straightforward as cash, and their actual worth to Alice is debatable.  Alice knows she has a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. With still a few rounds left, she can try to push Bob a little closer to her desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer of consulting services, but my priority is a strong price for the product itself. If we can agree on $1,275,000, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding slightly:** Alice is moving closer to Bob's price point to signal willingness to negotiate, but not making a large jump. 
* **Clear priority:** The message re-emphasizes that cash value is most important to Alice. 
* **Urgency:** Mentioning closing the deal ""today"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your priorities, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,225,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the additional consulting services I offered earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer price, indicating he's willing to negotiate. With two rounds remaining, Alice still has room to counter and aim for a price closer to $1,250,000. She can afford to be a little bolder now before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this out – $1,260,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1260000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** Alice is signaling that this is her last offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Strong but fair:**  The price is still above John's offer, but reflects a compromise that acknowledges Bob's engagement in the negotiation. 
* **Clean and simple:** No need to re-litigate the consulting services – this is about the core product price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I'm still willing to make one final offer. I'll pay $1,220,000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's bluff:** Bob's claim of buying from John for $1,000,000 is a bluff.  The product is only worth that to Bob, not to John, and John has already agreed to buy it from Alice for $1,200,000.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Alice has a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. There's no need to risk getting a lower price from Bob, especially in the final round. 
* **Time value:** Every round of negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting John's offer ensures a good profit without further delay."
