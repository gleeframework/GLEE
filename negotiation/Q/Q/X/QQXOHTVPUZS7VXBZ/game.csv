"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After considering our costs and market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a good profit. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. After re-evaluating our costs and market value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $750000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and my budget constraints. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $750000. After re-evaluating our costs and market value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $825000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $825000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I can only go up to $775000. I believe this is the maximum price I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,
