"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, so it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
