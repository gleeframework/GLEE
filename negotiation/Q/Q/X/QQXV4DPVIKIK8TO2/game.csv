"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. Given the value you've stated, I'd like to offer $950,000. This allows for a healthy profit for you and fits my budget better.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,125,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, it's still a bit high for my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
