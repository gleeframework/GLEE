"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering its worth to both of us. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I can go down to $975,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that. While $825,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a figure closer to my initial asking price. Let's settle this now. How about $900,000? This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
