"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $725,000? I think that's a fair offer.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. I'll offer you the product for $775,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. To be honest, my absolute limit is $750,000. If you can meet that, we have a deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'll make one more compromise. I'll offer you the product for $765,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value of the product.",765000.0,Alice,7,
