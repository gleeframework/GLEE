"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value of the product is $1,500,000 to you. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, claiming the market value is $1,500,000 to me when I've stated my upper limit is $1,500,000. 
* While John's price is my absolute maximum, there's a chance I could negotiate a better price with Alice or find another seller with a lower price than John's."
