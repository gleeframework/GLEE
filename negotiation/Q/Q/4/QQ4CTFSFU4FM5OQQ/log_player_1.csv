Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering your value and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is closer to your minimum requirement and a more fair price considering my valuation. This allows for a win-win scenario, and I believe it's a good starting point to finalize the deal.
