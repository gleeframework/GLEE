"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8750? That's the highest I'm willing to go.,8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9250. This is a fair price for both of us and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $8750, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",8750.0,Bob,6,
