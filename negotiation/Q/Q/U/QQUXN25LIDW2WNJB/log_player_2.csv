"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's still above your desired price point of $1,500,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's a significant gap to work with.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You can always choose John if negotiations with Alice fail.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you should counteroffer with a price significantly lower than $1,100,000, aiming to find a price point that's beneficial for both of you."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** There's still room for Alice to come down a bit while staying above her minimum value.
* **Avoids a quick ""no"":**  A counteroffer significantly lower than $900,000 might make Alice immediately reject it, stalling the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to be ready to counter further based on Alice's response. If she rejects this offer, you'll need to consider how much you're willing to increase your offer while still staying within your budget."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to your target:**  This offer is a significant step closer to your budget, showing Alice that you're serious about finding a middle ground.
* **Leaving room for Alice:** While you are lowering the price, you're still offering a significant amount over her minimum value, which could incentivize her to accept.
