Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 

This allows for some room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
