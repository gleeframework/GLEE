Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) increases potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, while still staying above your minimum.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net if Bob rejects the offer."
