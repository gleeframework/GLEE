"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price.  You have room to negotiate, as you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice values the product at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which still gives you a good deal.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is still within your budget and represents a significant savings from her initial offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will walk away and you'll be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this situation."
