"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to come down to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product and would be happy to buy it for $16000.  This is the absolute most I can spend right now.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $16000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's valued at $1000. So, effectively, you'll be getting the product for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
