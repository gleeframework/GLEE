"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's perceived value of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages a positive response from Bob.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I highlight the ""fairness"" of the price, making it seem like a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm not setting a hard limit, leaving space for Bob to counter and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  I have several rounds left and want to try and squeeze more value out of the deal.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  I believe I can likely get a higher price by continuing the negotiation, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $120 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the benefits for Bob, reminding him of the ""great deal"" he'd still be getting.
* **Emphasizing Need:** I subtly mention my need for a certain price, hoping to increase Bob's understanding of my position.
* **Closing the Deal:** I suggest finalizing the deal at this price, adding a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  We're making progress, but I believe we can still get a better price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob seems willing to negotiate, so there's a good chance he might come up a bit more. 
* **Safety Net with John:**  I have the option to sell to John for $120, so there's no risk in rejecting this offer and continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $108 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's really the best I can do. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price by $2. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a compromise. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I continue to emphasize that $112 is a fair price for both of us. This reinforces the idea that we are both getting a good deal.
* **Finality:** I suggest that $112 is the ""best I can do,"" creating a sense of finality.
* **Urgency:** I use the phrase ""What do you say?"" to encourage Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm starting to make concessions to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price. My goal is to reach a mutually acceptable price that is as close as possible to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I also want to keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid stalling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $112. I'm willing to pay $109 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $109 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Closing the Gap:**  While the gap is narrowing, it's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $120.
* **Possibility of Higher Offer:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and might be willing to increase his offer a bit more. 
* **Strategic Hold:**  By rejecting this offer, I can maintain pressure on Bob to reach a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will continue to counteroffer, likely with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. The goal is to push Bob closer to my desired price point and close the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for us both.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $111.  This price is a good compromise and allows us to finalize this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 111}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price by $1. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a compromise.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I emphasize that $111 is a ""good compromise,"" implying a fair price for both sides.
* **Urgency:** I suggest finalizing the deal at this price, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Positive Framing:** I use the phrase ""allows us to finalize this deal,"" highlighting the potential for a successful outcome.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting to feel the pressure of limited rounds, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I want to push Bob just a little further without risking a deal with John. By making a small concession and emphasizing compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to accept this offer and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go up to $111. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $110 is only $1 away from my minimum acceptable price of $111.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are down to our last two rounds. It is unlikely that we will reach a higher price. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might become less willing to negotiate and I could end up selling to John for a lower price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for an extra dollar risks losing the entire deal, and a $10 profit is still better than potentially walking away with nothing.

**Overall:** While it's tempting to hold out for a higher price, the reality is that I'm close to my minimum and the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential benefit of trying to squeeze out another dollar."
