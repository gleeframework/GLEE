"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a unique opportunity with incredible potential, and I'm confident it will deliver significant returns for your business.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000. This is a fair price that recognizes both the value of the product and your budget. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
