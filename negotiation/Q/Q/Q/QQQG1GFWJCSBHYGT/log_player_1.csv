Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you start high to see if Bob is willing to pay significantly more than its value to him.
* **Room for negotiation:** The high price leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere closer to your desired outcome.
* **Exclusive opportunity:** By framing the offer as exclusive, you aim to increase its perceived value to Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always negotiate down towards $15,000. Remember, any price above $15,000 is a profit for you in this scenario."
