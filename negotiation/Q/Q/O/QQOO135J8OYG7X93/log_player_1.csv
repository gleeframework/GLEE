Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1200000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is higher.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
