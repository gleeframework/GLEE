"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1200000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is higher.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $950000, which is a significant amount for me and still a fair price given the product's value. I believe this is a good opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1025000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to give up more than 5% of the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
