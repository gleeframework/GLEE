Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to secure a deal with Bob before moving on to your guaranteed sale.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his valuation) but also maximizes your profit.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Fair:** $1,350,000 is significantly below Bob's $1,500,000 valuation, giving him a strong incentive to accept.
* **Profitable for You:** This price still nets you a $350,000 profit over your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially negotiate an even higher price. 

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. If that happens, carefully consider your options and be ready to adjust your strategy to get the best possible outcome."
