"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to my business.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,300,000?  It's a fair price that still allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, but $1,280,000 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,320,000, which is a significant concession on my part.
