"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is worth quite a bit less to me than your initial asking price. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I'm confident this product will yield significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I could make a deal at $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000.  Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
