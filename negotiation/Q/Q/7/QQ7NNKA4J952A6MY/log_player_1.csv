Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality and value. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 (your minimum acceptable price), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, there's room to negotiate down towards his perceived value of $10,000 while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have the safety net of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
