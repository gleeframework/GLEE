"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than what John would charge, you can likely get the product for less. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice values it at $120, so there's room for negotiation.  A counteroffer will allow you to try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise. It's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her value of $120, giving her some incentive to accept. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $142 is only slightly higher than your previous counteroffer of $130, and it's still a better deal than buying from John for $150.  There's a chance you could continue negotiating and get a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially raising the price again is high. Accepting her offer secures the product at a price you're comfortable with."
