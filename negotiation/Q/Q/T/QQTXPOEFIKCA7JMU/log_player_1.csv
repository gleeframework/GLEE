Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below John's offer and our minimum acceptable price. We are only on Round 4 of 10,  so we have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can push Bob closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This offer represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now matched John's offer of $1,000,000.  There's no guarantee we can get a higher offer from Bob, and we risk him walking away.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the sale."
