"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top budget.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $125, which is still a great value for this product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something that will really make a difference.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go over $110.  How about we split the difference?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $110. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $120. It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the quality.",120.0,Alice,5,
