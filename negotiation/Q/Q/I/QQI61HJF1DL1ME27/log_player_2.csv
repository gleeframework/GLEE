Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000 as my final offer. However, I need to be upfront - if we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options for selling the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm on a price well above your budget. Her latest message suggests she's getting ready to walk away.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's unlikely you'll get close to the $1,000,000 mark you can get from John. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from your backup option."
