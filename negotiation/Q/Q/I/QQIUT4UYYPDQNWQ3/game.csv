"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $700,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $760,000? I'm eager to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $795,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
