It's better to accept Alice's offer at this point. Here's why:

* **Saving Money:** You're getting the product for $5,000 less than John's price ($800,000). 
* **Alice's Final Offer:** She's indicated this is her last concession. Pushing further risks her walking away from the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting now secures the product and avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forth."
