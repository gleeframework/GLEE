Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and casual, aiming to build rapport with Bob and spark his interest. 

I'm starting with a higher price to maximize my potential earnings. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer. I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation.  Selling to John right now guarantees me $12,000, but rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try for a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore if there's any middle ground and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe its value justifies a slightly higher price.  How about $15,000? This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've settled on $15,000. This is a compromise: it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price. 
* **Message:** I've highlighted the product's value to justify my counteroffer and emphasize the ""good deal"" for Bob.  I'm still open to negotiating further, leaving the door open for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's a bit higher than John's offer of $12,000, making it more profitable for me.  While I would have preferred my previous offer of $15,000, it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
