This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price considering the potential this product holds.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her ""final offer"" of $1,250,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will get her close enough to John's price to make it worthwhile.  At this point, it's more strategic to take the guaranteed savings and buy from John."
