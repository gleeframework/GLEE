"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and acknowledging the product's value. While I understand your initial offer, $800,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,400,000. This represents a considerable concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential to benefit your business.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm glad you see the value I bring as a potential buyer. To be honest,  $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
