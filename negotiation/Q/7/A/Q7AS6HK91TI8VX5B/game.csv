"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105? That's still a good value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
