Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for this product. How about $11,500?  It's a significant reduction from my original offer and still allows you to get a great deal on a product worth much more to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
