"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do believe the product is good, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This price reflects the value it would bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a price that reflects its worth, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,
