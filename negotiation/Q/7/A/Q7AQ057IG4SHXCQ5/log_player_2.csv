Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a price that reflects its worth, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

Explanation:

Alice is sticking close to her original price and has even stated ""$10,000 is my final offer."" It's unlikely she'll come down to a price near your target of $8,000. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John, guaranteeing you get the product at your desired price point."
