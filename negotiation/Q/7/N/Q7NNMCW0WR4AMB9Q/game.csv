"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your initial interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",880000.0,Bob,4,
