Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above my minimum value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm friendly and highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Strategy:** This approach aims to get a good starting price without being too aggressive. I'm confident that Bob values the product more than I do, so there's potential for a win-win deal. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $90 is above my minimum value of $80 and is close to my initial offer of $100. 
* Accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale quickly and avoid further negotiation. 
* While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or a lengthy back-and-forth isn't worth it for the potential extra $10."
