Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $8,500? This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be able to move forward with the sale.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, to $8,000.  This would be a good compromise and would allow both of us to be happy with the transaction.
