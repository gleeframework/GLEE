"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $8,500? This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be able to move forward with the sale.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, to $8,000.  This would be a good compromise and would allow both of us to be happy with the transaction.",8000.0,Alice,5,
