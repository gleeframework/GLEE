Bob's offer:

This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?

This price reflects the potential of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is now small. It's not worth the risk of Bob's negotiations stalling or him lowballing further.  Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome in this scenario."
