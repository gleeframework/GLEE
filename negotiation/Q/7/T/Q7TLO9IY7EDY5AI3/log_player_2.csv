"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $10,000 (since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice).  There are 10 rounds, so Bob has time to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you offering it. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500 for this product.  Would you be willing to go that low? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a moderate counteroffer, closer to his ideal price of $10,000, but still above Alice's minimum. This shows he's serious about buying but is also willing to negotiate. The message is friendly and acknowledges Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the price down. While $11,250 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his ideal price. He has more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,250, but I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to make the purchase.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but he's getting closer to Alice's price point. He's showing that he's willing to compromise, but he's still pushing for a better deal. He's also emphasizing his readiness to buy, which might incentivize Alice to accept."
