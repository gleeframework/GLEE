"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a nice product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",65.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you like the compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above your target. I can offer it to you for $78. It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",78.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $80. I can offer it to you for $79, though. It's a small step down from my minimum, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",79.0,Alice,7,
