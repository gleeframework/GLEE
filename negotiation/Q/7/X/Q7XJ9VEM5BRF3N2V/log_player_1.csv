Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, it's worth attempting to get the highest possible price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price ($9,999) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. It's unlikely he'll find a better deal elsewhere. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is phrased in a way that leaves room for negotiation, should Bob counter-offer. However, I'm starting with a strong position close to my minimum."
