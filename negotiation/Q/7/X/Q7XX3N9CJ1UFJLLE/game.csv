"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $8,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,750. It's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That seems like a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal then.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",9250.0,Alice,5,
