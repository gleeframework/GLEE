Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $8,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,750. It's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a slight improvement from her previous offer, you can still get the product for a lower price, especially since you have the option to buy from John.  It's worth another round of negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. It's the best deal you've gotten so far, and you're still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice backing out or the deal falling apart is too high, especially considering John's offer.  It's a good time to close the deal."
