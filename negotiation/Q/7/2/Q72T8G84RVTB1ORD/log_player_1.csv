{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $125 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $125 is more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $125 is less than Bob's maximum of $150, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's a good middle ground:** This allows for a potential compromise and gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal.

Keep in mind, depending on Bob's response, you may need to adjust your strategy further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate for a higher price.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** There's a chance Bob is willing to pay more than $100. 
* **Maximizing profit:** You can potentially earn more than your minimum if you keep negotiating. 
* **Testing Bob's commitment:** Rejecting his offer shows you're serious about getting a better price and might encourage him to come up with a higher counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to prepare a counteroffer for Bob. Since he's already gone down to your minimum, you may need to be flexible. You can counter with something like: 

```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm not quite ready to go down to $100 yet. How about $110? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm not quite ready to go down to $100 yet. How about $110? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Staying above your minimum:** $110 is still higher than your minimum of $100. 
* **Meeting Bob halfway:** You're proposing a price halfway between your previous offer of $125 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Showing flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates you're willing to compromise.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a good compromise. It keeps the negotiation moving while still trying to get a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer. Keep in mind, you can always adjust your counteroffer based on Bob's next response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $110 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $105? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While it's tempting to try to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's important to weigh the potential gains against the risks:

* **Bob's final offer:** Bob has indicated $105 is his absolute maximum.  Rejecting his offer might lead to a stalemate, leaving you with no sale.
* **Time and effort:** Further negotiation might consume valuable time and energy, potentially leading to a lower outcome.
* **John's offer:** While you can sell to John for $100, accepting Bob's offer yields a $5 profit compared to John. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer at $105 provides a reasonable profit and closes the deal, minimizing risk and maximizing your potential return."
