Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to part with it for $170. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $170 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make more than your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:** A higher initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he's willing to negotiate, he likely sees some value in the product. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since you have a fallback option with John, it's worth aiming high initially."
