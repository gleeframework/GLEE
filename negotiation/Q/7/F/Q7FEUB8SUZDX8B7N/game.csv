"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value it holds for you and the initial offer I made.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value it holds for you and the initial offer I made.",850000.0,Alice,5,
