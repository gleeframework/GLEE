"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize the industry. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $750000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the potential of this product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $825000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $825000 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $800000, but that's my final offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession by offering $825000, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount to sweeten the deal. I can offer you $820000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I expect you to consider it seriously. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
