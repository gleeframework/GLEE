"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and allows me to make a significant profit. Let me know your thoughts.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $1,300,000? This is still a great deal for you, and ensures I can cover my desired profit.
