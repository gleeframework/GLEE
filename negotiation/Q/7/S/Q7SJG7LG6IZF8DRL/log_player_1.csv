Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts in the middle of the potential price range.  It's high enough to give me a good profit, but still potentially attractive to Bob since it's lower than the product's worth to him.  

This also opens the conversation and allows for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that low just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to drop my price too much.  I believe this is a fair compromise and hopefully will lead to a successful deal."
