Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $70. While it's better than my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm countering with $85. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $80. Bob's offer of $75 is still below my desired price, and I don't want to continue negotiating further. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum, so it's the most secure and efficient option."
