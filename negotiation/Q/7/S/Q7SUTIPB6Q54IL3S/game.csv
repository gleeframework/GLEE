"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate your offer, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1350000? I believe this would still provide a good value for the product while staying within my financial limits.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite comfortable going down to $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1380000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",1380000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to counter with a price of $1360000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions and keeps my expenses within my desired budget.",1360000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $1360000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1390000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1390000.0,Alice,5,
