"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $135 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a great deal for a product worth much more! Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $160 is still a bit too high. How about we settle on $145? It's a fair price considering your bottom line and my budget.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $145 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $155. This is a good price for both of us and lets us close the deal.  Let's make this happen.",155.0,Alice,5,
