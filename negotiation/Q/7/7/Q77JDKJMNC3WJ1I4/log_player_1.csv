Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **""Message"":**  I've included a friendly and encouraging message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high allows for more room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will give me an idea of his potential budget and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Keep John as a safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can fall back on the guaranteed $8,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, that's a good starting point. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $8,000. While it's tempting to take the $7,500, it's not worth it to sell below my minimum.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. This will allow me to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price or, if necessary, sell to John for a guaranteed $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,500 is a bit lower than I can go right now.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm counteroffering with $8,500. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open, giving Bob the opportunity to potentially accept or offer a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $8000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum value.  While I could continue to negotiate and try to squeeze out a higher price, there's no guarantee of success.  

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away entirely or needing to sell to John for the same price.  
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation would take time and effort, which is better spent on potentially finding other buyers in the future.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice, as it secures a sale at my minimum acceptable price and avoids unnecessary risk."
