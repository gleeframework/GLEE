"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll appreciate its value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $14,000 is lower than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her $12,000 valuation. You can always fall back on buying from John at $15,000 if needed."
