"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's. There's no advantage to buying from Alice. Rejecting her offer means you can potentially negotiate a lower price with John, or simply buy at his set price, which is still within your budget."
