,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, given the value of the product to you. This is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price we both agree on, but $11,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I cannot go below $12,500.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
