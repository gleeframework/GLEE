"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice will be willing to negotiate further to avoid losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.  Would you consider a price of $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your understanding, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I can see you're willing to stretch your budget a bit, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still very close to his goal of $1,000,000. Rejecting and making another counteroffer might lead to a final price closer to his target. It's a gamble, but the potential savings are worth it at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $1,010,000. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1010000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,010,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000, which is a compromise that gets me closer to my target. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, Bob is still $15,000 above his budget.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  It's more advantageous to secure the product from John for his guaranteed price of $1,000,000.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept another counteroffer, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a missed opportunity or even a higher price if Alice changes her mind."
