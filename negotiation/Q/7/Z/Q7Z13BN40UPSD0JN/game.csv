"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $110 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $105 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise at $108. It's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, but still a bit lower than my minimum price. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,3,
