Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio, potentially even more so than to mine. I'm looking for a price that reflects its worth - shall we start at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for some profit for you.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product has the potential to bring you a substantial profit, and I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This offers a fair price for you and keeps me within my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
