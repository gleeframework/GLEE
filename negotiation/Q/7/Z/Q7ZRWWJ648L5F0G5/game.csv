"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for some profit for you.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product has the potential to bring you a substantial profit, and I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This offers a fair price for you and keeps me within my budget. What do you say?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
