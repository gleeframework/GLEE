"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident you'll find extremely useful. I'm offering it to you at a price of $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Please consider my offer carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at $800,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is fair, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a lower price, achieving his objective of minimizing costs."
