It's always a good idea to see if you can get a better price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation."

{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to  get a price closer to my target of saving as much money as possible. I'm hoping to entice Alice to negotiate further."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get a lower price, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  At this point, $835,000 is a good price and worth accepting. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely, especially considering I could purchase it from John for $1,000,000."
