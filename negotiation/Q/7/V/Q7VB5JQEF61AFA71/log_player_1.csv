Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is much lower. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is closer to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  I really want this product, but I can't go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you sticking to your budget, but I need to get a fairer price for this product. How about $15,500?  This is a significant discount on my initial offer and reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground. $15,500 is still out of my range. I'm committed to $12,000. If you're not willing to come down, I'll have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge beyond $12,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. Selling to John guarantees the $15,000, which is a fair price and avoids further haggling."
