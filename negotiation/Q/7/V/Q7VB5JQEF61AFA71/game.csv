"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is much lower. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is closer to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  I really want this product, but I can't go any higher.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you sticking to your budget, but I need to get a fairer price for this product. How about $15,500?  This is a significant discount on my initial offer and reflects the true value of this product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground. $15,500 is still out of my range. I'm committed to $12,000. If you're not willing to come down, I'll have to look at other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
