"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $90. Would you be willing to consider that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $95? This would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $95 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $102. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",102.0,Alice,5,
