"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price of $120.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is within your acceptable range of $120. It's better than buying from John for $120 and still leaves some room for negotiation if you reject.  However, with the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially ending up buying from John, it's a good idea to accept and avoid any further risk."
