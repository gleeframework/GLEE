"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is within your budget, it's still too high. You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $110 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, while still being within a range where she might be willing to negotiate. It also shows you're serious about buying the product but are looking for a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more than $110. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $120, which is a significant drop from her initial offer and within your budget.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to either buy from John at a higher price or lose the opportunity altogether.  Accepting the offer at this point secures the product at a reasonable price."
