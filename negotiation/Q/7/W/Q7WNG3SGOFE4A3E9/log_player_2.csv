"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price ($15,000).** You want to save as much money as possible, so accepting her offer is not ideal.
* **Rejecting allows you to counteroffer.** You can try to negotiate a lower price, potentially closer to your desired range. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You can always purchase from John if the negotiation with Alice fails, but it's more expensive than what you're aiming for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within your budget:**  $13,000 is still within your maximum price of $15,000, giving you room for further negotiation.
* **Reasonable starting point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but not so low that it feels unreasonable or insulting.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $13,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  $13,500 is still below your maximum price of $15,000.
* **A compromise:** Alice is willing to meet you halfway, which is a good sign that she's interested in making a deal. 
* **Potential for saving:**  While you didn't get your ideal price of $13,000, you still saved $1,500 compared to buying from John. 

While you might be able to negotiate a bit lower, it's likely that further negotiation would be time-consuming and may not result in a significant savings.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most practical decision in this situation."
