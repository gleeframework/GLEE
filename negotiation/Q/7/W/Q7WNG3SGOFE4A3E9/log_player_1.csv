Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit ($2,000) while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob. It's also a fair starting point, considering the product is worth more to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is a good price, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $13,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
