Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. It's a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation but still reflects the product's value to me. I'm confident Bob will understand the product's worth, and we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing a sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure the deal now."
