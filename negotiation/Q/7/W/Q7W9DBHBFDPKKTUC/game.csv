"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant amount considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $900,000.  This is a very fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that would allow us to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $900,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
