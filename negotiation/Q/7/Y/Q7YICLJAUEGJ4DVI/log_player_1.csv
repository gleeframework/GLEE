Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000. I'm willing to part with it for $1,700,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have a strong fallback position. This allows you to aim high with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** By stating that the product is potentially worth $1,500,000 to Bob, you are anchoring his perception of its value.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a single negotiation round. In a real-world scenario, there would likely be back-and-forth negotiation, allowing you to adjust your price based on Bob's responses and reactions."
