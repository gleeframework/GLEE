"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a great idea. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,5,
