{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. 

I've reached a point where Bob and I are stuck at an impasse. He's unwilling to go above $100, and I'm not willing to go below $110.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's more beneficial for me to sell to him and avoid any further negotiation."
