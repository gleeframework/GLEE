Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had from others, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a higher price ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable in his mind. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest from others,"" I'm subtly implying there's competition, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), signaling I'm willing to hear his thoughts and potentially negotiate.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely counter with a lower price (but still above $15,000) before moving on to John."
