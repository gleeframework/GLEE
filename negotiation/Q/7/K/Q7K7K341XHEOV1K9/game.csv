"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? It's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still unable to meet the price of $11,250. I'd like to propose $11,100 as my maximum offer. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",11100.0,Bob,4,
