"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value the product holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can offer you a price of $11,500, which is a compromise that I think is still reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up more than $1,000 from my initial offer. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is the midpoint between my initial offer and your last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To make a deal, I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price that is closer to our positions and will allow us to close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're in the final stretch, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the $10,750 offer, but I'm not going to give up more. I can offer you a price of $10,875, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. Let's see if we can wrap this up.",10875.0,Alice,9,
