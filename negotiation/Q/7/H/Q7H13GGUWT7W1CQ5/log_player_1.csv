Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to what I want, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to me.  I'll try to counter with a price that is more in line with my minimum acceptable value."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than his previous offer, it's still not high enough. I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll try to counter with a price that is more in line with what I believe is fair."

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Although I was hoping for a better price from Bob,  I'm running out of time and need to secure the sale. This price is still above my minimum acceptable value and ensures a successful transaction."
