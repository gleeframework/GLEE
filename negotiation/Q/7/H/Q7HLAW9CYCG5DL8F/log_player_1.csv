"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, even though it's not a unique selling point in this scenario. This is a common tactic to build rapport and frame the offer in a positive light."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still below it. I'm not willing to sell for less than $120 at this point.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is appealing,  I haven't exhausted all options with Bob yet. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to $110.  This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not all the way. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. Can we meet at $107? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is key:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob has expressed a willingness to compromise. 
* **John's offer:**  John's offer is appealing, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise. How about we split the difference at $109? That would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway, signaling a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Fairness:** Emphasizing a fair price for both sides helps to frame the offer as a win-win scenario.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm using language that suggests a strong desire to reach a final agreement, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can we try $106? I'm willing to make one more compromise to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still below it.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We've been negotiating for several rounds, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to go higher.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is for my minimum acceptable price, and there's no guarantee that Bob will accept my next counteroffer. It's wiser to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John. 

**Conclusion:**  It's better to be sure and sell to John for $120 than risk another round of negotiation that might result in a lower price or a stalemate."
