"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking to make a profit, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is still above your maximum budget of $80. 
* You know you can get the product for $80 from John. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to your backup option and save $30."
