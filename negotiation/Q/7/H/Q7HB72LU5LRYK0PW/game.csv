"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $750,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is a good offer, it's a little lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This still ensures a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable price point considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $825,000 is a bit out of my budget. I propose $775,000 as a counteroffer. I believe this brings us closer together while still being within my financial limits. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'd like to see a price closer to my initial offer, I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $790,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures a mutually beneficial outcome.  What do you say?",790000.0,Alice,5,
