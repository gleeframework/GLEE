"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $135. This is a great deal as it's worth much more to me, but I want to make sure you have a chance to get it first. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $135 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. Since your goal is to save money and $120 is your maximum price, buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
