Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth a lot to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being a good deal for me.
* **It's below my minimum:** My minimum is $15,000, so I have room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is straightforward and gives Bob a reason to consider my offer.

By starting with this offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or move on to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and leaves me with a lower profit margin. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round to try and reach a more acceptable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I'm confident this is still a great value for you considering the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not drastically lower my price.
* **It's lower than my initial offer:** This demonstrates flexibility and might encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **It's closer to my minimum:** This keeps the deal profitable for me.

By offering $12,500, I'm hoping to find a price that's both fair for Bob and profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still too low for me. While I want to make a sale, it's crucial that I secure a price that reflects the value of the product to me.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000, I'm going to sell the product to him. This ensures I achieve my goal of earning a decent profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
