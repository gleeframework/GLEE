Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It also highlights the potential value the product offers to him. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I aim to get as close to my desired price as possible.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  A friendly tone invites Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $100 from John gives me leverage if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can secure a better price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain value:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell and that I value the product.
* **Negotiate further:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point.
* **Keep John as an option:** I'm still willing to sell to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $100, which is my minimum acceptable value and exactly what John is willing to pay. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes compromise. It also acknowledges Bob's offer while stating my own position.

**Strategy:**

* **Seek the middle ground:** This offer positions me as reasonable and willing to negotiate while still maintaining my minimum desired price.
* **Leverage John's offer:** By mentioning John's offer, I subtly suggest that I'm not desperate and could easily sell elsewhere.
* **Encourage acceptance:** A friendly message and fair compromise can increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum value of $100.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm concerned that the price won't go up further.  It's also unclear how much more time and effort I want to invest in this negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Cut losses:**  I'm choosing to sell to John for $100 because it's the best guaranteed outcome at this point.
* **Avoid risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a lower price or an extended negotiation process.
* **Opportunity cost:**  My time is valuable, and it's not worth investing it in an uncertain negotiation when I have a guaranteed $100 elsewhere."
