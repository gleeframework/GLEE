"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. It's something I value at least $120, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and proceed to buy from John to maximize your savings."
