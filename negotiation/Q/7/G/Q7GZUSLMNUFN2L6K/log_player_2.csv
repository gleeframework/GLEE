"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still slightly above my comfort zone. I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially since I can always go to John for $10,000.  I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
