"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but $10,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,000? That would be a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $13,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
