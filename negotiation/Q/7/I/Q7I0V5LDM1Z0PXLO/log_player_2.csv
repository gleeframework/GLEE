Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but $10,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $13,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

While Alice is coming down in price, it seems unlikely she'll go below $13,000. John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, which is better than Alice's current offer and ensures I don't overpay."
