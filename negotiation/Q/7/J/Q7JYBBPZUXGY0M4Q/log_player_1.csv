Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum ($100) and is likely to be attractive to Bob, as it's below his perceived value ($120). This gives you room to negotiate further if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to get closer to your ideal selling price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer compromises slightly from your initial offer while still being above Bob's offer. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while aiming for a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has shown a reluctance to increase his offer. It appears there is a stalemate. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of further counteroffers leading to a lower price exists. Selling to John guarantees your minimum value and saves time and effort."
