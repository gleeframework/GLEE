Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product, especially tailored for your specific needs, is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $1,325,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still in the early stages of negotiation. While Bob is moving closer to our desired price point, we have room to negotiate further and secure a better deal. Accepting $1,275,000 would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your persistence. I respect your position and willingness to negotiate. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,300,000 for the product. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered and is my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on this price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $1,285,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and our discussions.  It would be a win-win for both of us.   
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we haven't reached our ideal price, Bob is steadily increasing his offer, and we are now above our minimum acceptable price. Accepting $1,285,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further drawn-out negotiations. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
