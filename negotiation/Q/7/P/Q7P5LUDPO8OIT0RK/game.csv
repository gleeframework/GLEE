"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, and I'm happy to pay $7500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $8200. This is a great compromise that still gives you a good deal on the product, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to meet you at $8000, which is my absolute limit. This would allow us both to finalize the deal. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,4,
