"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll get.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still High:** While Bob's offer is lower, it's still above my minimum value of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I have 8 rounds left. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to try to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer, showing flexibility.
* **Re-emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and that this price is still a good deal for him.
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm subtly adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is a fair price for both of us, encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum value of $10,000. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  We are getting closer to a deal, but there's still room for me to potentially get a higher price.
* **Time to Counter:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have enough time to continue negotiating.  Selling to John now means I'd miss out on potentially earning more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's go with $11,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Compromise:**  I'm continuing to show flexibility by meeting Bob closer to his offer, demonstrating a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Reframing the Offer:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, reminding him of the value of the product.
* **Adding Personal Touch:**  I'm expressing my hope that we can reach an agreement to build rapport and create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,750. I'm willing to pay $11,500, and that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Agreement:** Bob's offer is very close to my previous counteroffer and is only $250 below it.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Continuing to reject Bob's offer could risk losing the deal completely. He has stated this is his final offer.
* **Better Than John:**  While $11,500 isn't my ideal price, it's still significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.

It's time to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and get a good price for the product."
