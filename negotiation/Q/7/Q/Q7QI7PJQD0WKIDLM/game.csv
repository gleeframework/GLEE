"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for something that could significantly benefit you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm offering $850,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my valuation of the product is considerably higher. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the true value and potential of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $950,000 is my final offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
