"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for something that could significantly benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high. It's in your best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm offering $850,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but my valuation of the product is considerably higher. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the true value and potential of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$1,200,000 is still too high, especially considering John is offering the product for $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $950,000 is my final offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
