Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation, and it's above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping to get as close to the value of the product to Bob as possible, but without knowing that value, I'm starting high to leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come up a bit in his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  Since John is also offering $15,000, I'll accept Bob's offer.  There's no reason to risk going through another round of negotiation when I can secure the sale at my minimum price."
