"Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value to me is $1,500,000, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product and understand your valuation. In light of this, I am proposing a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product while allowing us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,200,000 is closer to where I want to be, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This represents a significant discount for you and allows me to acquire the product at a price that makes sense for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
