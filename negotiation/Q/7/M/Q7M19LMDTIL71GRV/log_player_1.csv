Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to offer a price lower than that to Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price provides a strong negotiating position. Bob might accept outright, especially if you emphasize the product's value to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer doesn't leave room for Bob to haggle down, it establishes a clear starting point. If Bob is truly interested but hesitates at $10,000, he can counter-offer, and you can still accept his offer or meet in the middle if it's beneficial. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you value a quick and potentially more profitable sale over the certainty of selling to John for $10,000."
