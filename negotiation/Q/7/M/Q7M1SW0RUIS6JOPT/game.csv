"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $2000000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's unique features and potential value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. It's still a great deal, and I believe it's worth considering.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's unique value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1200000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1350000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's unique value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell it to you.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
