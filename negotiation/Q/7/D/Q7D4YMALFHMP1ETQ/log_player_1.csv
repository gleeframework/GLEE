{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This allows for back-and-forth negotiation while still keeping my goal of maximizing profit in mind.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **Backup plan:** While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum price, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm still above Bob's offer but have lowered my price to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate that $8,000 is too low, highlighting the product's worth.
* **Motivation to reach an agreement:**  I express my desire to make a deal with Bob, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Plan B:**  I'm still keeping John in mind as a backup, ensuring I'm not pressured into accepting a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's closer, it's not enough to make me comfortable selling.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum price, so I can afford to be patient and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a good middle ground, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's, showing flexibility while still being above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize middle ground:**  I'm framing my offer as a ""good middle ground"" to encourage Bob to see it as a fair compromise.
* **Focus on value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Collaborative approach:** I use phrases like ""find a solution that works for both of us"" to emphasize a win-win outcome.
* **Backup plan:** I'm still confident in selling to John if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $9250 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $8750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a deal:** Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below my target.
* **Risk of going lower:**  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, putting me closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks delaying the sale and potentially missing out on John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Backup plan:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring a certain outcome and avoiding further negotiation. 

It's better to accept John's offer now and secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price than to risk a lower offer from Bob."
