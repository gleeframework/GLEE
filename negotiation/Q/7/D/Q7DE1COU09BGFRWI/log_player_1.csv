Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, we can then adjust the price based on his counteroffer. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm not willing to settle for a low price, and I have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? That's a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
This counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I'm proposing a middle ground, which might be more appealing to Bob than a further rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $10,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise.  While it's still below my initial asking price, it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price, and it's a better deal than selling to John for $10,000."
