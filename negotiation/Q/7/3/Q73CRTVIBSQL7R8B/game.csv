"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a significant discount, and I can still get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,000,000 to $900,000, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. Can we discuss further?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to finalize the transaction.",875000.0,Alice,5,
