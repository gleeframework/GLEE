"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I can do $11,000, but I think I need to get closer to my target price. Can you really only offer $10,250?",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

"I'm starting to get a bit worried that we won't reach a deal, Bob. I can do $11,500, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle",11500.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, you know I'm serious about buying this product, and I've been fair in my offers. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's absolutely my limit.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd hate to see this fall apart now.",10750.0,Bob,10,
