Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000** is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation. It's significantly higher than my minimum value, allowing me to potentially earn more.
* The message is friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in a conversation about the price. 

This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will indicate whether he sees value in the product and how much he's willing to pay.
* **Create a space for negotiation:** Starting high allows for a potential compromise that still benefits me.
* **Maintain a good relationship:**  Being friendly and open to discussion could lead to a more positive outcome, even if the price doesn't reach my ideal."
