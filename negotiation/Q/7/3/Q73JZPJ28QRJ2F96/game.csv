"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000.

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll sell the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
