Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This gives me room to negotiate while also ensuring I get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While I want to sell the product, $125 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to $140, which is still above my minimum price of $150.  I believe this is a reasonable offer that might convince Bob to buy the product while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to make a sale to Bob, his offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to sell to John and get my minimum desired price, rather than continue negotiating and risk getting an even lower offer."
