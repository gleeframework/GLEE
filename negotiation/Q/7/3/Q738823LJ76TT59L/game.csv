"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. How about we start the conversation at $500,000 and see if we can find some middle ground?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $700,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $600,000. Would you be open to considering that?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to the product's value to you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $650,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $600,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $625,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going below $675,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $662,500? It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get a deal done.",662500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to come up a bit to make this work. How about $640,000? That's a significant move on my end, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",640000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $640,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $658,000? It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get a deal done.",658000.0,Alice,9,
