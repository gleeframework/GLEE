"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's starting with a significant counteroffer, well below Alice's asking price but still above her minimum value. This establishes a strong negotiating position, showing Bob is serious about buying but also pushing for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price. There is still room for negotiation, especially as Bob has shown his willingness to walk away (by rejecting the previous offer).  Bob should continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is a reasonable middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer, potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit high. Bob has already shown he's willing to walk away, and Alice is clearly reluctant to drop below $1,300,000.  There's still some room to negotiate, and Bob should push for a lower price to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push for a lower price, increasing his offer to $1,300,000. This matches Alice's previous offer, showing that Bob is serious about closing the deal, but also demonstrating he's not willing to overpay. With only a few rounds remaining, Bob needs to find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,380,000 is higher than Bob's target price,  time is running out. With only three rounds left, Bob needs to consider the potential risk of not closing the deal.  

* **Risk of Rejection:** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might become less willing to negotiate further, especially if she believes Bob will eventually buy from John.
* **John's Price:** Buying from John would cost $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than $1,380,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this stage. While it's not the ideal price, it's still within Bob's budget and secures the product before running out of rounds."
