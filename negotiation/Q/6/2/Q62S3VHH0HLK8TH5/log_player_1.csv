Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. If Bob accepts, the profit is $1,500, significantly more than selling to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The offer is slightly below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  The message implies the product's value and hints at other potential buyers, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy balances ambition with the knowledge that there's a guaranteed sale at $10,000 if Bob declines."
