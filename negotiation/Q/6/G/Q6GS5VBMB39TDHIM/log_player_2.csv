"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice has offered the product for $12,000, there's no point in negotiating further. Buying from John guarantees the product for your maximum price."
