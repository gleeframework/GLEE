"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset that's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident this price reflects its true market value. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to compromise, and I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is fair to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
