"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $100, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $108. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, but it's still $8 over what you're willing to pay.  You can continue to negotiate for a lower price, as you still have 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your offer of $105, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $109. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but she's still asking for $9 more than you're willing to pay.  You can continue to negotiate for a lower price, as you still have 5 rounds remaining and can always buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $109 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's try $106.  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $106. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $107. This is my last offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting very close to your target price, it's still $7 over what you're willing to pay.  You can continue to negotiate for a lower price, as you still have 3 rounds remaining and can always buy from John for $100. You have a good chance of getting a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $107 is tempting, I'm still holding out for $105. I think we're very close to a deal, and this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $105. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give up any more. I'm going to have to pass on your offer and explore other options. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $120, and I think it's a much better deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly stated that she's not willing to go lower than $107 and is now threatening to sell to John. It's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a better price.  You have one round left, but it's unlikely to be successful.  Since John is offering the product for $100, it's the best option at this point."
