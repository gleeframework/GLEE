"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $100, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $108. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your offer of $105, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $109. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $109 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's try $106.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",106.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $106. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $107. This is my last offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",107.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $107 is tempting, I'm still holding out for $105. I think we're very close to a deal, and this is my final offer.",105.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $105. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give up any more. I'm going to have to pass on your offer and explore other options. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $120, and I think it's a much better deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,9,
