{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** $100 is more than the $80 Bob is willing to pay, but it's still lower than your minimum.
* **Reasonable:** It's not too aggressive, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Clear and concise:**  It's straightforward and easy for Bob to understand. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's far below my minimum price of $120. I'm not willing to accept such a low price, as I can easily sell to John for a much better price. I will counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
This counteroffer is:

* **A compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing I'm open to negotiation.
* **Still above my minimum:** It's more than my minimum price of $120, so I'm still making a profit.
* **Reasonably close to Bob's offer:** It leaves some room for further negotiation, but it's also significantly closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price for it. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price of $120, Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and his offer is close enough to my minimum price of $120.  It's not worth risking a further negotiation that could drag on and lead to a potential loss with John."
