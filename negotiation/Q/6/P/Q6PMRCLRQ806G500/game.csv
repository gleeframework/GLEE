"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than that to me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm providing.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $7,500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
