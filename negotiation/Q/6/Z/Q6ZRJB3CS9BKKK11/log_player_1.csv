"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a fair starting point, as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay a little more than my minimum to get the product, and this offer gives him a chance to counter without feeling like I'm being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident that I can get at least $112 in the next round, and possibly even closer to my desired $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm countering with $112. This is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not giving away too much. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to accept this offer, as he's already shown a willingness to pay more than $110."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident that I can get at least $110 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price given that Bob's offer is now below my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as he's shown a willingness to pay more than $108 in the past."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $100. While I'd prefer to get a better price, Bob's counteroffers are getting too low, and I'm worried that we'll run out of rounds before I can get an acceptable price. Selling to John ensures I still make a profit, and I can avoid the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob."
