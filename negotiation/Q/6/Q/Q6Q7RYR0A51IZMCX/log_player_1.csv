"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit. I believe $11,500 is a fair starting point, as it leaves some room for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable value and leaves some room for compromise.  I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable value.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better price.  Since John is also offering my minimum, it makes sense to sell to him to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
