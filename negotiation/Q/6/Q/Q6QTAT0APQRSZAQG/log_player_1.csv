Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the market value, and I know it would be extremely valuable for your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see where it leads."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a fair offer, and it's the absolute highest I can go. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also starting to consider selling to John if we can't reach a deal soon."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,025,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I'm starting to feel like we're too far apart. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
