"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $11500. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice is offering a compromise, the price is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better for Bob to reject the offer and buy from John for a lower price."
