"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product to me first, but $20,000 is quite a bit over my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 for it right now.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is too low for me. This product is worth significantly more. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
