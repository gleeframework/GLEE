# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is too low for me. This product is worth significantly more. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

While $15,000 is closer to your budget, it's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you know you can get it for $8,000 from John."
