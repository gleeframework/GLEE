"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I'm interested,  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go below $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on $11,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,3,
