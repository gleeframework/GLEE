"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. While I recognize its value to you, I'm unable to accept $1200000 at this time. I'm willing to consider a price of $1350000, which I believe reflects the product's potential and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
