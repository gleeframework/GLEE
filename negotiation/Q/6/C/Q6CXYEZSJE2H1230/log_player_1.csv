{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the potential benefits for Bob to build rapport and make him more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, showing I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm keeping John in mind, so I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,500 is still below my $15,000 minimum.
* **Negotiation potential:** I can still try to get a better price from Bob.  
* **John is a solid backup:** I'm confident that John will purchase the product for $15,000, so I have no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500?  That gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** My counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but closer to his price, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Compromise Focus:** I'm emphasizing that my offer is a compromise, making it seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and open to further discussion, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm still prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob doesn't agree to a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $11,000 is close to my minimum of $15,000, it's still a significant difference.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob's statement that this is his final offer suggests that he's unlikely to budge further.  
* **John's Guaranteed Price:** I'm confident that John will buy the product for $15,000, giving me a much better deal than accepting Bob's final offer. 

I'm choosing to end negotiations with Bob and secure the higher price from John."
