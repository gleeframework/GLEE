Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value and exclusivity you've mentioned. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the proposed price of $1200000. I'm interested in discussing a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is $950000. I hope this aligns better with your interests and we can move forward with a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
