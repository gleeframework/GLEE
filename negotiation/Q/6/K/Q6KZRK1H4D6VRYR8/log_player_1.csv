"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation but sets a high initial expectation.
* **Friendly opening:** I'm keeping the message friendly and casual to build rapport. 
* **Direct offer:** I'm directly stating my price to avoid any ambiguity. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible within the 10 rounds. This initial offer is a starting point, and I'll adjust based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:**  $90 is still a good price for me, but I believe I can get closer to my target of $120. 
* **Value to Bob:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to pay a good price. This shows he values it.
* **Limited Rounds:**  I have 9 rounds left and want to make the most of them. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $100. I'll aim to find a middle ground that allows me to maximize my profit while remaining competitive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it lets me get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the deal:** I'm reminding Bob that $95 is still a good deal for him, as the product is worth $120. 
* **Staying firm:** I'm not giving in completely to Bob's offer, showing that I have a price point I'm comfortable with.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground and close the deal in this round. If Bob rejects again, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I want to avoid wasting too many rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $95. Can we try $92.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $92.50 is very close to my target of $120. It's a great outcome considering we're only in round 4.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk of Bob walking away.  It's possible I could get a better offer in the later rounds, but it's not guaranteed. 
* **Time factor:**  We've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and the limited rounds are a factor. 

**Strategy:**

It's better to secure a good price now than risk losing Bob and ending up selling to John for $80."
