Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and my offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Agreement:** For a successful deal, the price needs to be between $800,001 and $1,199,999.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting it. 

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message Tone:** The message is positive, emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Price Point:**  $1,000,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant profit margin for you while leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still making a satisfactory profit."
