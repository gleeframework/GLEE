"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, I am unable to meet your current offer of $10,500. I would like to propose $10,000 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects both the value of the product and my budget constraints.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 still falls short of what I need. I'm willing to go down to $10,250.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's finalize this deal, and I'm confident you'll be very satisfied with your purchase.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I'd like to counter your offer with $10,000. I believe this price is fair and within my budget. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
