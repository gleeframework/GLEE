"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing that my minimum is $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly opening:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to establish rapport.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm asking Bob for his opinion to encourage engagement and gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to do $80?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
