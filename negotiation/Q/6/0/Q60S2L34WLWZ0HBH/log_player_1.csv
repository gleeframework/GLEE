Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is smart. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but slightly below your guaranteed price leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested but finds the initial price a bit steep.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is clear, concise, and avoids any pressure tactics that might scare Bob away. 

Even if Bob rejects this offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed to sell to John at your desired minimum price."
