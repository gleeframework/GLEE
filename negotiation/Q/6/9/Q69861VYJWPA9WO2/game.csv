"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential you see in this product. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective. While $1,350,000 represents a fair valuation considering its potential, I'm willing to move closer to your offer. How about we settle at $1,200,000? I believe this price reflects a win-win for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $1,100,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and would likely close the deal quickly.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures you're getting a great deal on a valuable product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
