{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and establish a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I respect the value of the product, I would like to propose $100 as a fair price considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to accept this, as it's a good deal for me and I'd rather sell it to Bob than John."
