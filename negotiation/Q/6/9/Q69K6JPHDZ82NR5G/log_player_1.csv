{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly or use his counteroffer to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I will reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price to try to reach a mutually agreeable point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
