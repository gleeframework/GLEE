"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and the benefits it offers.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is the highest amount I am comfortable spending on the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,450,000. This offer reflects the value I bring to the table and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, I must stick to my budgetary constraints. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. This is the maximum I am able to spend on the product while still staying within my financial limits.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
