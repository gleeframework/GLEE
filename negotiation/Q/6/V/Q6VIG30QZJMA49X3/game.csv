,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get closer to my minimum for this product. Would you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to what I can afford, but $13,000 is still a touch high. How about we settle at $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
