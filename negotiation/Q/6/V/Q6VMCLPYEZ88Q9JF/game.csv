"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. My asking price is $13,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $11,500? I'm really hoping to get a good deal.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your desire for a good deal. However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there with $12,250.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,875.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product.",11875.0,Bob,4,
