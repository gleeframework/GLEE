{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. My asking price is $13,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation. It's significantly higher than John's offer, but still below Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $11,500? I'm really hoping to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your desire for a good deal. However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there with $12,250.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,875.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,875 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's a good deal for me and worth accepting, as continuing to negotiate might lead to a further decrease in price, and I don't want to risk selling it to John for a lower amount."
