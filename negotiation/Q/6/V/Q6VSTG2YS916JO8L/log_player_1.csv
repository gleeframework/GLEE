Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,300,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below my guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price without revealing my bottom line. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, suggesting a willingness to negotiate.

This approach maximizes the potential profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving room for a deal to be made."
