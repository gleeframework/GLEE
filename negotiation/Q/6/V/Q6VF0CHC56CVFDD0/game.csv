"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm not sure $130 is in my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  That way, we both save some money.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to save money, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet at $112.50? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to give you a bit more flexibility.",112.5,Alice,5,
