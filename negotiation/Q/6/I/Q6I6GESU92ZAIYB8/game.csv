"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $13000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'd be happy to buy it from you for $11500.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11500 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
