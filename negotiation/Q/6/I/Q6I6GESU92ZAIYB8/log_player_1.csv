Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $13000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'd be happy to buy it from you for $11500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $11,500 is too low, and I can still get $12,000 from John if I need to."
