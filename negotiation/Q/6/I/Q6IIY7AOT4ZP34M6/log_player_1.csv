Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $400,000 if he buys from you at the right price.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $800,000 (your minimum) and $1,200,000 (Bob's maximum). Any price within this range could lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept. Consider these factors:

* **Greed vs. Security:**  A very high offer might make Bob reject it out of fear you're unwilling to negotiate.  
* **Relationship:** If a future relationship with Bob is important, a fairer price might be strategic.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,050,000 is fair. This gives you a significant return on your investment while reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** This offer is significantly closer to Bob's valuation, giving him a strong incentive to accept.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" you're justifying the high price without being overly aggressive.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. You could adjust the price within the ZOPA based on your risk tolerance and how important a quick deal is."
