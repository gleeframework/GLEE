"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum value.  What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to negotiate, but $75 is still too low for me.  How about $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum value. Let's close this deal!",80.0,Alice,5,
