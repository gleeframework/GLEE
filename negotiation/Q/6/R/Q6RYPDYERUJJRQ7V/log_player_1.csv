Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with an offer of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and upbeat, aiming to build rapport with Bob and make him feel comfortable negotiating. 
* **Highlighting value:** I mention the product is ""amazing"" and a ""great fit,"" subtly implying its value without explicitly stating it. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximizes profit:**  Starting high increases the potential for a higher final price. 
* **Sets the negotiation framework:** This establishes a clear starting point for the negotiation and signals my seriousness about selling at a good price. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  Having a higher initial offer allows me to make concessions without feeling like I'm losing too much. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I will need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the flow of the negotiation."
