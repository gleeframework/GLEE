"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product. I understand it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My asking price is $1,200,000. This leaves substantial room for profit on your end, and allows me to achieve a price closer to what the product is worth to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
