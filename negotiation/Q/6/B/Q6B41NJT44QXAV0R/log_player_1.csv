"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than the midpoint ($115), but still significantly above my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I'm still making a good profit. I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to counter with a higher price and see if I can secure a deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110, which is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not willing to go too far below my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair deal and agree to it."
