"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $13500. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but not that low. I'm counteroffering $12500. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
