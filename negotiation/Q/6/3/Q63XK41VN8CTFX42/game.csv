"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I am pleased to counter your offer with a proposal of $600000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the value we believe the product holds and your expressed budget.

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $650000.  This shows my serious interest in purchasing your product, but it's also the highest I can go without exceeding my budget.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I'm glad to hear that you're willing to increase your offer. In light of your proposal, I am now able to consider a price of $625000 for the product. This figure represents a compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while also taking into account your financial constraints. I hope this offer helps us reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",625000.0,Alice,5,
