"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is truly exceptional, and I believe it will deliver significant value for your company.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000, which is still a fair price considering the potential returns.  I'm open to further discussion, but this is my best offer for now.  Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
