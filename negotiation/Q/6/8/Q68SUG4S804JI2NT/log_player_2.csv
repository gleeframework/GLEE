It's time to accept Alice's offer.  

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We've been going back and forth with relatively small increments. The difference between getting the price down to $750,000 and accepting $800,000 isn't worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Alice's Stance:** She's been firm and repeatedly stated this is her ""final offer."" Pushing further might make her walk away, forcing us to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Good Deal:** $800,000 is significantly less than our $1,200,000 maximum and represents a $200,000 savings. It's a strong negotiating outcome.

While we could try for one more round, the potential gain is outweighed by the potential loss at this point. Let's secure the deal at $800,000."
