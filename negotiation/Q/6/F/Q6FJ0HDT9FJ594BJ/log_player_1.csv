Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum acceptable price, $120. While I know it's worth $100 to Bob, I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a little more.  If he rejects, I can always move on to John and get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a counteroffer of $115.  This is a compromise between his offer and my desired price. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob's offers are getting increasingly closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm not sure we'll be able to meet in the middle. To avoid the risk of getting stuck in a drawn-out negotiation and potentially losing out on more profitable opportunities, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
