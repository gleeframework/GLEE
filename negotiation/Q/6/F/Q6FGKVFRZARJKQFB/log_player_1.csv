Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification for Value:** By mentioning ""significant value"" and ""well worth the investment"", you subtly reinforce the idea that the product is worth a premium.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""What do you think?""  leaves the door open for Bob to respond and potentially negotiate the price, rather than simply accepting or rejecting. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could experiment with different starting prices and messaging. The key is to leverage the fact that you have a backup buyer to maximize your potential profit."
