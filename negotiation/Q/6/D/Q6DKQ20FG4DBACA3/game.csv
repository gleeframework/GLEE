"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be totally transparent, my absolute top end for this product is $7,000. If we can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your top-end budget is $7,000, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $8,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,
