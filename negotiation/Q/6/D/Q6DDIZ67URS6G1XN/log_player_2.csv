"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and she's offering $800,000. It's worth seeing if you can get a better price by submitting a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product. However, I think $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($600,000) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range of Alice's valuation ($1,000,000).
* **Polite and Respectful:**  The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, crucial for a successful negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, we're still a significant amount away from potentially securing a much better deal.  Here's why it's worth another counter:

* **Alice is Negotiating:** Her willingness to meet halfway shows she's open to finding a compromise.
* **Room for Improvement:** There's still a $400,000 gap between her current offer ($700,000) and your maximum budget ($1,200,000).  
* **Leverage of John's Offer:**  Remember, you always have the option to walk away and buy from John at $1,200,000. This provides leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. While $700,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Negotiation:** We're demonstrating willingness to negotiate by making a counteroffer that's a reasonable step from our previous offer.
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:** This offer is directly in the middle of the current price gap ($650,000 is halfway between $600,000 and $700,000), which often feels fair to both parties in a negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We're not conceding too much ground too quickly, keeping the option of walking away to John as a viable strategy if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $650,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:** Alice's offer of $675,000 is a substantial savings compared to your maximum budget of $1,200,000 or even buying from John at $1,200,000.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:** You've successfully negotiated Alice down $125,000 from her initial offer.
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While you could counter again, there's a risk of jeopardizing the deal and potentially having to pay more if you go with John. 

This seems like a good time to accept the offer and secure a great price on the product."
