"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product. However, I think $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. While $700,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000.
