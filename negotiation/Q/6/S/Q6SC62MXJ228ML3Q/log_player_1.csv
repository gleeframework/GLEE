{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a good compromise:** It's higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves some room for negotiation to reach a price closer to Bob's $15,000 value.
* **It's a clear signal:** It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also showing that I'm not desperate to sell at the lowest possible price.
* **It includes a friendly message:** This helps establish rapport and encourages Bob to engage in a positive and constructive negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  While I'd like to sell to Bob, I can't afford to accept such a low price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?
