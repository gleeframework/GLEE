"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant benefits you'll reap from it.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  To make progress, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential. To move towards a mutually agreeable outcome, I propose a price of $1,325,000. This represents a reasonable compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you're placing on the product, and I'm committed to reaching a deal. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  To move forward, I'm offering $1,275,000.  This shows my willingness to compromise while staying within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire to find a suitable price point. Considering its true worth and our progress, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This minimal adjustment reflects my commitment to closing this deal, while still acknowledging the significant value this product offers you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're making good progress.  $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I still need to be at a price point that works for my budget.  To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm offering $1,290,000.  Let's find that middle ground and get this done.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
