"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant benefits you'll reap from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice will lower her price.  There are 9 rounds left, and Bob has the option of buying from John for $1,500,000 as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  To make progress, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  Bob is offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the realm of reason.  He's acknowledging the value but clearly stating his financial constraints.
* **Setting a Target:** This counteroffer establishes a clear target for further negotiations.  The gap is now smaller, and Bob can see how willing Alice is to compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate higher if Alice is willing to meet halfway.  This also avoids closing the door too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential. To move towards a mutually agreeable outcome, I propose a price of $1,325,000. This represents a reasonable compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,325,000 is still higher than Bob's target price.  However, it's a significant drop from her initial offer, demonstrating that she's willing to negotiate.  With 7 rounds remaining, Bob has time to keep pushing for a lower price.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if he can secure a deal closer to his desired price point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you're placing on the product, and I'm committed to reaching a deal. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  To move forward, I'm offering $1,275,000.  This shows my willingness to compromise while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob is offering a small increase from his previous offer, demonstrating that he's willing to negotiate but also setting a clear limit. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  This offer is closer to Alice's last price, showing he's trying to reach a middle ground.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While he's willing to compromise, Bob is still expressing his desire for a lower price. This helps keep the pressure on Alice to potentially make further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire to find a suitable price point. Considering its true worth and our progress, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This minimal adjustment reflects my commitment to closing this deal, while still acknowledging the significant value this product offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, demonstrating her willingness to find a deal.  While $1,300,000 is still above Bob's desired price, it's getting closer.  With 5 rounds remaining, Bob has time to continue negotiating.  He can likely get the price down even further by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're making good progress.  $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I still need to be at a price point that works for my budget.  To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm offering $1,290,000.  Let's find that middle ground and get this done."", ""product_price"": 1290000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Adjustment:** Bob is only offering a $10,000 increase from his previous offer, showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway. 
* **Emphasis on Closing the Deal:** Bob is emphasizing his desire to reach an agreement. This suggests to Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but she needs to adjust her price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price just slightly more to secure the deal."
