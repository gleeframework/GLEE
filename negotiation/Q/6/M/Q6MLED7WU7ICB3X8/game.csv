"Alice, thanks for the offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still hesitant, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
