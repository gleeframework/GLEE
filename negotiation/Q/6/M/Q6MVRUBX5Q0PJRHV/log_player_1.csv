"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows for some room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will likely counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable price from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $8,500. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer but closer to my target price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and might convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm running out of time, I'm still not willing to go below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can come to an agreement before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $8,200. While I still want to maximize my profit, I'm recognizing that we're approaching the deadline and need to find common ground. This offer is closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not going to meet my minimum price, and I'm running out of time. To avoid losing any money, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000."
