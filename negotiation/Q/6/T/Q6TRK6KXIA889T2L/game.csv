"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1100000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1000000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $1050000 is the minimum I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $1025000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
