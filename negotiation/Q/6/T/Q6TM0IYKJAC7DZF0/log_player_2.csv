"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value and your interest, I propose we make this transaction special. For you, the price would be $110. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you is $120. Let's make this a win-win situation! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly higher than Alice's valuation ($100), it's still lower than your maximum willingness to pay ($120). This means you'll save $10 compared to buying from John."
