Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I believe the product's value is higher than $700,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and potential benefits. I'm confident you'll find it a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $800,000.  I'm still saving $250,000 compared to buying from John, and I'm confident that further negotiation will only get more time-consuming. It's a good deal, and I'm ready to close it."
