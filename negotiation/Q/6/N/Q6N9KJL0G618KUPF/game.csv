"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is a good offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum price.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to lower my price to $775,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. ",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $775,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $740,000? ",740000.0,Bob,4,
