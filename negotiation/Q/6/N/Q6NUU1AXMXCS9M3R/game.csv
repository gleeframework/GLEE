"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $14,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's the highest I can go. Can we meet at $10,800?",10800.0,Bob,4,
