Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $14,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's the highest I can go. Can we meet at $10,800?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800

``` 
While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price point. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk Bob walking away.
