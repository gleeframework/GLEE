Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to sell, I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer and try to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $17,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above my minimum value and  leaves room for some potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him at a higher price, I'm not willing to go much lower.  John is offering a reasonable price that's above my minimum. I'll take his offer to avoid further negotiations."
