"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000, which is $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
