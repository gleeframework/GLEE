"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your comfortable budget.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000, which is $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my comfortable budget of $8,000.  While I've managed to bring the price down, I'm not confident I can get Alice to come down any further. To avoid potentially wasting more time and risking a breakdown in negotiations, I'm going to purchase the product from John for $8,000.  This guarantees I get the product at a price I'm happy with."
