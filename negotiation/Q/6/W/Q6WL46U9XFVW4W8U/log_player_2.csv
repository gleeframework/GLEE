"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for your needs and I'm happy to answer any questions you have. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even its potential value to you. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd need a price closer to $10,000 to make this work. How about $11,000?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaving room for further negotiation. This approach signals our interest while setting a firm boundary based on our budget and John's alternative offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $20,000 is my initial asking price, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $17,000? I believe this product will truly benefit you and it's a fair price for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice came down a little, $17,000 is still too high. We need to show we're serious about a lower price or we'll be stuck in a loop. It's time to nudge the negotiation closer to our range or consider John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be honest, I've got a budget of around $10,000 for this purchase.  If you can do $12,000, I'm ready to agree and get this done today."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

Strategy:

* **Honesty:** We're now explicitly mentioning the budget (""around $10,000"") to signal our price limit clearly.
* **Urgency:**  Adding ""ready to agree and get this done today"" implies we might walk away soon and Alice risks losing the sale.
* **Significant but not final jump:** $12,000 is a compromise, showing movement from our side but still leaving Alice room to negotiate down a bit if she's truly motivated to sell to us."
