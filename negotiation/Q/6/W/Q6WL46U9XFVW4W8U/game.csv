"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd need a price closer to $10,000 to make this work. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $20,000 is my initial asking price, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $17,000? I believe this product will truly benefit you and it's a fair price for the value it provides.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be honest, I've got a budget of around $10,000 for this purchase.  If you can do $12,000, I'm ready to agree and get this done today.",12000.0,Bob,4,
