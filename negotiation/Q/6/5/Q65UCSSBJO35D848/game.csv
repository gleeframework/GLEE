"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to our previous offer, so I'm willing to sell the product for $850,000. This is my final compromise for now.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
