"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $700000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $850000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000 either. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $775000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,
