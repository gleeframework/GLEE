"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly less than the $1,000,000 price from John, making it a good starting point for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $850000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000 either. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $775000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $775,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $850,000 and is still cheaper than buying from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer represents a good compromise and saves Bob a considerable amount of money."
