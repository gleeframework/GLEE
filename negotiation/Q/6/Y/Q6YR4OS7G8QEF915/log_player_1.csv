Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could offer it at $150, there's a chance Bob will reject it. I want to maximize my potential profit by aiming slightly above his perceived value.
* **Attractive Offer:** $125 is a significant markup from Bob's $100 valuation but still represents a potential ""deal"" for him.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John if Bob declines. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a good profit and not losing out on the guaranteed sale to John."
