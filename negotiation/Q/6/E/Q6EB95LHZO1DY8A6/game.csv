"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and $1,200,000 significantly undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I understand the product's value, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the market value and the potential returns on investment.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your perspective on the value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,220,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns on investment. I'm getting close to considering John's offer, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
