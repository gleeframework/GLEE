"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer ($1,200,000) from John ($1,500,000).  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer. This price is still within Alice's acceptable range (as the product is worth $1,000,000 to her). This shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product but are also trying to get the best deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. It's still within your budget of $1,500,000, and there's no guarantee that you'll be able to negotiate further and get a lower price."
