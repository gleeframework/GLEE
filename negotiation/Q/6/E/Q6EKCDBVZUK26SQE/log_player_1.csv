Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and this is a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $15,000 is Bob's maximum, starting high at $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Strong Alternative:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $12,000, giving me leverage. I don't need to undervalue the product."
