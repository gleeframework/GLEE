Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is higher than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $120 is lower than what Bob values the product at ($150). 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can lower it slightly and still make a profit, or you can see if he'll counter-offer. 

This approach is designed to maximize your profit while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially getting a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $105 is still lower than your initial offer, it is better than selling to John for $80. It's also a reasonable compromise considering Bob's consistent willingness to negotiate. Accepting the offer secures a sale and allows you to avoid further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a lower price."
