"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $117?",117.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $117 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $121.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",121.0,Alice,5,
