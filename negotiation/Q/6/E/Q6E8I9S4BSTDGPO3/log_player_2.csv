"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation to get closer to $120.  I'll counter-offer and see what happens."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to her value, but I think there's still room to negotiate. I'll hold off accepting for now and propose a counteroffer closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $117?"",
""product_price"": 117
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $117 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $121.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great deal! Alice is very close to her lowest acceptable price, and this saves me a significant amount compared to John's offer."
