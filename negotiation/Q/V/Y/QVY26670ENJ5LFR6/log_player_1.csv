Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it offers significant value, especially considering it's worth $150 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 provides a safety net. This allows you to aim higher with Bob.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup plan."
