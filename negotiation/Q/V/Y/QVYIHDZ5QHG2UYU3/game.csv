"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm asking for $10,750. This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let's close this deal!",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice, but $10,750 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value I think the product will bring me.",10250.0,Bob,4,
