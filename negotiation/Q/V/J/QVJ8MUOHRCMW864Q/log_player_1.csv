Round 2
Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $15,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $16,000 is close to my ideal price and  better than selling to John for $15,000. It's a good deal."
