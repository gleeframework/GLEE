"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8750. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is very close to my counteroffer of $8,500.  It's likely that we're close to the point where further negotiation won't get me a much lower price. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking further rounds of negotiation that could result in a higher price or a stalemate."
