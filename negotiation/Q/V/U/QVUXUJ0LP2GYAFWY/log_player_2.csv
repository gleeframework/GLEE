"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. Bob can get the product for $10,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
