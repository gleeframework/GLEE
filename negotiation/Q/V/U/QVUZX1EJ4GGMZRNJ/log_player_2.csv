"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $700,000."",
 ""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation.  My goal is to purchase for as low a price as possible, and starting low gives me the best chance to achieve that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider coming down to $900,000. This offer still gives you a great deal at $100,000 less than its true value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'll continue to counter-offer to try and get a price closer to my target."

{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it."",

}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to get Alice closer to her actual value for the product. It's possible she'll accept, but even if she doesn't, it shows I'm serious about purchasing while remaining firm on my budget."
