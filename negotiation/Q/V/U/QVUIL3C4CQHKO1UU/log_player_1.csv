**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer.  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of him walking away and getting stuck with a worse outcome."
