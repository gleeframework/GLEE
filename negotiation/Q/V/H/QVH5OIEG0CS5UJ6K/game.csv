"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value you'll get from this product, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $725,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get. This is my final offer. Let's make a deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
