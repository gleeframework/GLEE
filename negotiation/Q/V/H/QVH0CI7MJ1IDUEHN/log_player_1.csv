Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still ensuring a profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Deal:**  While we have John as a backup, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Closing the deal with Bob quickly is preferable.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and ensuring a sale."
