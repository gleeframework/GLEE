Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $150 allows for some wiggle room if Bob counteroffers, ensuring I can still make a good profit.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at this price. 
* **Opportunity for Higher Profit:** There's a chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or, if he's unwilling, still sell to John for the same amount.  
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer immediately would result in zero profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $125 to make this work.  Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $125 still provides a decent profit margin for me.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $125, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Accepting Bob's offer now keeps the door open for potential future negotiations with him.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Rejecting Bob's offer and making another counteroffer carries the risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me to sell to John at the same price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a small profit while maintaining a good relationship with a potential future customer."
