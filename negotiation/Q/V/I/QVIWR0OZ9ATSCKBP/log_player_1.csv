``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also provides a clear reason why Bob should accept, playing on his perceived value of the product. This approach aims to maximize profit while leaving the door open for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000. It's still possible to reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob, so I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still find it a great value. "", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John, but I'm still interested in your product. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount. I'm confident I can get closer to my target by continuing negotiations with Bob.  I will reject his offer and try one more counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is closer to your offer and still a fair price.  This is my final offer - let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
