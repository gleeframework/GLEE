"I'm excited to offer you the product for $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me. However, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we settle on $1,200,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,200,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
