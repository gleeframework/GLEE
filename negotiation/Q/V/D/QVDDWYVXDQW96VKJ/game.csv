"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $120 was a bit high, but $100 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
