"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a significant amount above my minimum of $80, leaving room for negotiation while still being a decent starting point.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. I highlight the product's value and my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a better offer than John's $80, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $120 was a bit high, but $100 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a price of $110, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my goal. 
* **Message:**  I'm reaffirming my interest in selling to Bob, acknowledging his offer, and explaining why my counteroffer is reasonable. I'm focusing on the benefit to him by highlighting the ""great deal"" he'd be getting."
