"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is within his budget, it's likely he can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $120 was a bit high, but $100 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $150, and Alice's offer of $110 is within his budget. 
* **Potential Savings:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small compared to the risk of losing the deal. 
* **Time:** It's round 3, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a deal with John for $150.

Accepting the offer at $110 ensures a purchase while still saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
