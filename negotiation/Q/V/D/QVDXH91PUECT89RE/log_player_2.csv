"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is good, but Bob can likely get a better deal. 
* It's always worth exploring further negotiation before committing. 
* By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore his options and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save even more. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for your product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to compromise a bit.  $900,000 is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to sell for $950,000. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $950,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, saving him $250,000 compared to buying from John.
* Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice might reject the counteroffer and the deal could fall through. 
* It's more prudent to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a good price, rather than risk losing it and having to pay John's higher price."
