"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do any better on the price? I was thinking closer to $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit far from your target of $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Alice,3,
