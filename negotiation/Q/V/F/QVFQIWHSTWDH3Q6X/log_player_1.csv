Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,065,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. Given the exceptional value and potential this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and your desire to own it. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 4 rounds remaining, the negotiations are getting increasingly difficult.  Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's likely that we will continue to haggle back and forth, and there's no guarantee that we will reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. 

To maximize my earnings and avoid the risk of a lower final price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This decision ensures I get my desired price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
