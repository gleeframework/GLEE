"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more so than for me. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the value of this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's significant worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,025,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but it's still a bit high.  Let's split the difference.  How about $987,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  While I can't accept $987,500, I am willing to move a bit further.  How about $1,010,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
