"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more so than for me. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's within your budget, but you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the value of this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's significant worth while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  While she's moving in the right direction, you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  It's worth trying to lower the price further before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,025,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but it's still a bit high.  Let's split the difference.  How about $987,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  While I can't accept $987,500, I am willing to move a bit further.  How about $1,010,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price that's higher than I'm comfortable with.  While her counteroffers are getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There are still 5 rounds left, so I have time to see if we can reach an agreement closer to $987,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
