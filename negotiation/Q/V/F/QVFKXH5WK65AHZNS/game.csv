"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $800,000 to me, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it.",875000.0,Alice,3,
