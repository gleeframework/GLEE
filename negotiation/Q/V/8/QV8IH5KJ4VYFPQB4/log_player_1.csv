Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This price reflects its value and provides a fair opportunity for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price slightly lower than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on fairness:** I emphasize a fair price that benefits both parties, creating a positive negotiation environment.
* **Open to counteroffers:**  I clearly express openness to Bob's counteroffer, signaling willingness to negotiate. 
* **Backup plan:**  I keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price.  
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial asking price, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your offer,  $1,350,000 feels more appropriate considering the product's value and our previous discussion.  This price allows for both of us to benefit.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to the middle:** I'm aiming for a compromise by offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I reiterate the importance of a fair deal for both parties, keeping the negotiation positive. 
* **Open to further discussion:**  My message leaves the door open for continued negotiation if Bob is still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer is very close to my initial target price of $1,350,000.
* **Risk of losing a better deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I might end up selling to John for a lower price. 
* **Time for a compromise:**  It's time to accept a slightly lower price rather than risk a lengthy negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
