"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but within a reasonable range.  This allows for negotiation and leaves room for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John is tempting, I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob. I'm willing to give him another round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Since we're already on round 4,  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and would rather secure a sale."
