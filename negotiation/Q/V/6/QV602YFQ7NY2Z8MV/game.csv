"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. I could consider $1,200,000. This offer reflects the product's value while still providing you with substantial benefit.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
