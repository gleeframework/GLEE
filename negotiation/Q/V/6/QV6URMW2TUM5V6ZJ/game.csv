"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I can do $115, but that's as low as I can go.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate that Alice. $115 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can do $112, but that's as low as I'm comfortable going.",112.0,Alice,5,
