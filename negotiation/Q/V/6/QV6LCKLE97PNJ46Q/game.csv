"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That would be fair for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
