Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible from Bob, knowing John is a guaranteed sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below John's offer ($1,450,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** The message leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, Alice can adjust her approach in subsequent exchanges."
