"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $850000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",800000.0,Bob,4,
