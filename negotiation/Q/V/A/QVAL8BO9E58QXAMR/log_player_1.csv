Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:**  A high initial offer helps you assess Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have John as a backup who is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is his maximum price, as he stated he's ""only able to pay up to"" that amount. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a significant gap between Bob's offer and both your minimum price ($10,000) and your initial offer ($13,000). This indicates room for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides leverage.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can attempt to negotiate a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I could consider letting it go for $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  The price drop is substantial but still keeps the offer well above your $10,000 minimum and closer to your starting point.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's reaction.  If he's completely unwilling to budge from $8,000, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I still feel that $8,000 would be a fair price for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,250 is above your absolute minimum of $10,000.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  Bob's message suggests he's made a significant concession and is unlikely to go much higher.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation further might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit."
