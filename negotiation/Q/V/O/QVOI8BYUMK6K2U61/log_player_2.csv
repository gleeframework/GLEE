# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's also of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10500. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
