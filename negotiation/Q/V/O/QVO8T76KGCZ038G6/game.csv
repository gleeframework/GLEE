"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price elsewhere.",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you say?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a deal for $82. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $82 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $78, which is a good compromise.  Let me know what you think.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $82 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $80. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",80.0,Alice,5,
