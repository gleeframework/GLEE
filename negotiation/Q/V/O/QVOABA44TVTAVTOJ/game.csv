,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a significant price difference, but I'm really interested in the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. How about $875,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both move forward. ",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit low for me.  To show you my willingness to make a deal, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this.",850000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $820,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",820000.0,Bob,8,
