"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering. Since Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice values the product at $12,000, there is room for negotiation.  A counteroffer will likely lead to a lower price for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'd like to offer $13,500.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,750? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $13,750 is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:** Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but the risk is that Alice could walk away, and Bob would be left with John's higher price.
* **Time:** Accepting the offer saves time and effort compared to continuing negotiations. 

Bob is better off accepting Alice's offer at this point and securing a good deal."
