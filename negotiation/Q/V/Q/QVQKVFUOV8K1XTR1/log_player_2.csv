"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's better to reject Alice's offer.  You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  While $95 is a better price than $100, you still have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's still higher than Alice's value for the product, but lower than your maximum value. This gives Alice incentive to accept, while still leaving room for further negotiation if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is within my budget and a better deal than buying from John.  It's worth accepting this offer."
