Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. Let's find a middle ground. How about $18,500? That's a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find an agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $16,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price range. While his offer is getting closer to John's price, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal than $15,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon to avoid delays with other potential buyers."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $17,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I also need to make a decision soon. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's final offer of $16,000 is higher than John's standing offer of $15,000. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving us with the guaranteed $15,000. Accepting his final offer ensures we make a profit and avoids the potential risk of losing him as a buyer."
