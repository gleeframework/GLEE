"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the product's worth to me, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm subtly emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. 

This strategy aims to get a good starting point and gauge Bob's initial interest without immediately pushing him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Profit:**  While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to me. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is a Last Resort:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is a safety net, but I'm not yet ready to accept such a low price. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $13,000. This will allow me to gain more ground and hopefully come to a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while presenting a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price, implying that it's beneficial for both parties. 
* **Focused on Profit:** I'm subtly reinforcing the importance of making a reasonable profit. 

This strategy aims to show flexibility while still pushing for a better price. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in this offer and be willing to meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiation to maximize profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** I'm curious to see if I can push Bob further before considering selling to John. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $12,500, leaving some room for negotiation but emphasizing that I'm not willing to go much lower."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I am too. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good outcome. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer shows firmness by not going significantly lower, but still offers a compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, reinforcing the value of the deal for him.
* **Call to Action:** I'm encouraging Bob to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards a more agreeable price while still maintaining some room for negotiation.  I'm ready to be flexible, but I'm also not willing to drop below $12,000 without seriously considering selling to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but I'm at my limit. $11,500 is my final offer. I understand you want a good deal, but I also need to make a fair profit. If we can't agree, I'll have to consider selling to John.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Fair Profit:** I'm reminding Bob of the need for a fair profit, justifying my price point.
* **John's Threat:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the alternative, increasing pressure.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer is a strong but final attempt to secure a better price before resorting to selling to John. I'm hoping that the combination of urgency and the potential of losing the deal will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a fair profit, but I'm still trying to get the best deal for myself. I'm willing to meet you at $11000. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds left, the risk of ending up with John's offer of $10,000 is high. 
* **Small Margin:** While Bob's offer is still below my desired price, it's only $500 less than my previous offer. 
* **Time to Close:** It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk getting nothing at all in the final round.

I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the potential of a lower price with John."
