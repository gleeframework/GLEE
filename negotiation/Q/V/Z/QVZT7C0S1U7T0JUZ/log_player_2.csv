Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget. Rejecting and continuing the negotiation is a better strategy than accepting or buying from John. You can try to make a counteroffer closer to your budget in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

This counteroffer is closer to your budget and leaves some room for negotiation. It is a good strategy to show Alice that you are serious about buying the product, while still trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget. Even though you can continue the negotiation, it's unlikely that Alice will go lower than $15,000, her minimum acceptable price.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John for $15,000 and avoid further negotiations."
