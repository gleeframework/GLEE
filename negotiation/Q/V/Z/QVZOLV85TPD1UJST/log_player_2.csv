"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than Alice's perceived value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate further and potentially secure a lower price.  There's always the option of buying from John for $10,000 if negotiations fall apart completely."

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $10,750?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,750 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,875. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,875 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and it's possible the negotiations could drag on.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John for his desired price of $10,000, saving him time and money."
