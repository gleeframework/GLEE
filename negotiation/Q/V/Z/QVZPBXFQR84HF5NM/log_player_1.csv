"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not willing to sell for anything close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price.  While selling to John is an option, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a bit more.  I'm still hoping to get a better price, but selling to John is becoming a more tempting option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to $1,300,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to what I believe the product is worth. If this offer is rejected, I'll be more likely to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get significantly closer to my desired price with Bob. He's not budging much, and I've already lowered my offer several times.  While $1,000,000 isn't ideal, it's still a good deal and guarantees a sale.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
