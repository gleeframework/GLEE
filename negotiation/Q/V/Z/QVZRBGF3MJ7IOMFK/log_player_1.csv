Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($10,000) as it gives me more room to negotiate down if necessary.  
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to potentially pique Bob's interest. 
* **No Mention of John:**  I'm not mentioning John at this stage.  I want to see Bob's initial reaction and potential counteroffer before bringing in another buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** My minimum value for the product is $8,000. Bob's offer is at that minimum, but I believe I can still try to get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I'm not desperate. I have another buyer (John) ready to pay $8,000. This gives me leverage to counter Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's initial offer allows me to continue the negotiation and see if I can get a higher price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your offer, I'm looking for something closer to my initial price.  How about $9,000?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my original $10,000 asking price. This shows willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By sticking to a price above my minimum, I keep some leverage. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and focuses on finding a solution that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $7500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Limited Upside:** It's unlikely Bob will go higher, especially since he's stated it's his maximum.
* **Guarantee:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
