Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation isn't moving significantly closer to my target. I don't want to risk further rounds of back-and-forth, potentially getting stuck at a price far lower than my minimum.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I secure a price that meets my minimum threshold."
