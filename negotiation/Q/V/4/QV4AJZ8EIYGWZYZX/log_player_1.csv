Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it's worth the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly remind Bob that he could lose the opportunity if he doesn't act.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the asking price is $15,000, the phrasing suggests you're open to discussing the price further. 

This approach aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a sense of agency in the negotiation."
