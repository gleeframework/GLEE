"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me and we can both walk away with a good deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your offer. However, after careful consideration, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. How about $9,000 for the product? This is still above its worth to you, but it also reflects a reasonable profit for me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
