Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum of $8,000 but leaves some room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he has incentive to negotiate a lower price, but it's still a good deal for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above the guaranteed $8,000 from John, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still a good price for Bob as he values the product at $10,000, and it's closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to drop my price further.  I'll sell to John for $8,000 as it's a guaranteed sale and the best option at this point."
