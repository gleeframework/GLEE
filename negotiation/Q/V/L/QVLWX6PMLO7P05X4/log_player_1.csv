Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she needs to leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal.
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning ""listing it publicly"" and ""anticipated demand,"" Alice adds a time pressure element to encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,500, there might be a small window for Bob to counter-offer, still landing Alice above her minimum acceptable price."
