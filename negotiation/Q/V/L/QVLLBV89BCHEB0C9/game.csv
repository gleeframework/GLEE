"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $17,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a good middle ground here. While $17,000 is closer, my budget for this is really around $14,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I can appreciate your budget, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $15,500? That's my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down. I'm getting close to my limit though. I could do $14,500, and I think that's a very fair offer.  What do you say?",14500.0,Bob,6,
