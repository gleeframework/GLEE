Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $10,000 to him, and this initial offer reflects that belief."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is a good price, I believe the product is worth more than that, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident that Bob is still interested in the product and will likely make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,500. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I hope this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous offer, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him. It's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers. I'd rather secure a sale at $14,000 than risk ending up with $10,000 from John."
