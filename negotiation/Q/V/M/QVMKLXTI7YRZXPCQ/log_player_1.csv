Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is because I want to leave room for negotiation and potentially earn a higher price. I know that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so I believe this offer is within a reasonable range that could motivate him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer than his initial rejection, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,450,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial offer. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate for a sale. This price is closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that Bob will be more willing to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm worried that he might not be willing to meet my price. I'm confident that John will buy the product for my minimum price, so selling to John is the most secure option."
