Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing its worth to Bob, potentially justifying the high price.
* **Backup option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net if Bob rejects the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters the initial offer."
