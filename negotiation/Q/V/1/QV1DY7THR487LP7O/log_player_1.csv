Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is only worth $100 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 to match your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $119 tempts Bob with a potential deal while still getting you very close to your maximum profit. 

This approach aims to find a balance between getting the highest possible price from Bob and ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
