"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit you. I am offering it to you for $140. This is a special introductory price, and I hope you'll take advantage of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my desired price point. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to get this product for a little less. Would you be willing to go down to $130?  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'd like to counter with an offer of $135 for the product. This is still below its perceived value, but it's closer to what you're looking for. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still slightly higher than my initial counteroffer.  This price is within my budget, and it's more advantageous than buying from John for $150."
