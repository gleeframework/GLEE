"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you counter-offering.  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for this product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we try $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

You have three options:

How about we split the difference again and land at $9,000?  This feels like a fair offer to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I can go up to $8,000, but that's my absolute limit. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reasoning:  Bob is very unlikely to go much higher than $8,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a significant risk of losing a guaranteed $12,000 from John. It's better to take the sure thing in this case."
