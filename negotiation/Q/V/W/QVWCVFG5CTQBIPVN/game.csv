"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product.

"Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",825000.0,Alice,5,
