"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $12,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  Let's find a middle ground.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be as flexible as I can, but $12,750 is just a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference again, and try $13,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,900? I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget.",12900.0,Bob,6,
