Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing if we can find common ground here. $12,750 is a fair price. It's still a good profit for me, and I think it's a good deal for you. Let's finish this negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $12,750, Bob has reached the point where he's willing to accept the guaranteed price from John.

Buying from John ensures that Bob gets the product at his target price, saving him time and effort."
