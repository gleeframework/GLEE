I believe this price is more in line with the market value of similar products and would be a more reasonable investment for me.

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in coming down to $1,650,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $1,575,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a significant investment in the product. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1575000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,575,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will be a valuable investment for your company.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,575,000 and $1,600,000, which would be $1,587,500. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm eager to finalize the deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
