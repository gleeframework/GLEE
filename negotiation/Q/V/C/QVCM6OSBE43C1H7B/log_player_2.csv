Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.
