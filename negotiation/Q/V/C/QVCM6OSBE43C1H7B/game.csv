"Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,300,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This offer reflects a fair compromise and allows us to potentially close this deal. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,600,000. This reflects the significant value you're gaining and avoids further negotiation.  Let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and a fair price given the value of the product. If we can meet in the middle, we can close this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
