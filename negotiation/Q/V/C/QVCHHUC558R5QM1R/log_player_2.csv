Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  Continuing the negotiation is risky as it might lead to a worse outcome than buying from John for $1,000,000."
