Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. A price too close to $1,500,000 might scare him off, while a price too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're positioning the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 gives Bob a $150,000 discount from his valuation, making it attractive. It also nets you a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""fairness"" and ""return on investment"" adds weight to your proposal.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might try to negotiate further. Be prepared to hold firm to a certain point or potentially make a small concession if needed."
