"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This price aligns more closely with what I am able to afford while still allowing me to acquire the product. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some wiggle room for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budgetary considerations, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price is higher than my initial proposal but still within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While your offer of $1,050,000 is closer to what I need, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. Based on my budgetary constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,060,000. This price is slightly above your last offer but still within my financial limits. I hope this helps us reach an agreement that is acceptable to both of us.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
