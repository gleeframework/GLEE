Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate but ensures you don't immediately lose money.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you with room to negotiate downwards if necessary without compromising your minimum value.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It's straightforward and doesn't leave room for misinterpretation.

By starting with this offer, you'll get a sense of Bob's willingness to negotiate and can adjust your strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum value of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob, especially since you have the option of selling to John for a much higher price if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to your minimum value, it's still below your ideal outcome.  Since you have the option to sell to John for $15,000, it's worth attempting to negotiate further with Bob.  You might be able to secure a higher price by making a final counteroffer."
