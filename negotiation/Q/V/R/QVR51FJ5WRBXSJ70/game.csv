"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this compromise?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $10,500, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise closer to $11,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,800, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  I'm open to discussing this further, but this is my final offer.",10800.0,Alice,5,
