Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."",
""product_price"": 17000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate. We are still significantly below what John is offering. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows us to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but need to stay above $15,000. How about $16,000?  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 16000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $11,500. That's pushing my budget, but I'm confident this product would be valuable to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer increases are getting smaller.  While he might eventually go higher, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 John is offering, especially with only four rounds remaining. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
