"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That still gives you a great value on the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $108. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
