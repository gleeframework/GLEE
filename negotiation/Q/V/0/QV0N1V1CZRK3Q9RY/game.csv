"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you do $17,000? I'm trying to find a fair middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value in the product, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
