"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,050,000. It's a fair price that considers your needs and my value for the product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer and a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value our ongoing discussion, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of this product. Let's finalize this agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
