Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly lower than your minimum value, but still potentially appealing to Bob given his perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation, but also allows you to explore whether Bob is genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I still need to make a profit.  $12,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's offer and my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's first offer, it's still not ideal.  Jhon offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is significantly more profitable.  I'll take Jhon's offer and end the negotiations with Bob."
