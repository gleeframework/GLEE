"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1400000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than my floor.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, and I have 8 more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is still a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1250000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  I'm also mindful that I have only 6 rounds remaining before I have to consider selling to John."
