Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12,000. I believe it represents a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it seem more reasonable to the buyer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** By starting high, I'm inviting Bob to counteroffer, which gives me more information about his willingness to pay. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while also considering the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and moving on to John, who's a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm better off negotiating further or selling to John.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, and I don't want to leave money on the table prematurely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't sell it for less than $11,000. This product is truly unique and offers significant value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down from my initial offer, signaling flexibility, but not too much. This positions the negotiation closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price. 
* **Direct Question:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

By offering $11,000, I'm aiming for a price that's above my minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is unique and valuable, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I could counter again, the increments are getting smaller, and it seems unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer. John represents a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's more profitable to cut my losses with Bob and proceed with John."
