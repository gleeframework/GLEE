"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, but I don't know how much more. This initial offer will gauge his interest and provide a starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident Bob values the product more than that, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still being closer to my ideal price. I'm hoping this will lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I believe Bob is still willing to pay more.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,125,000.  This is another step in the right direction, demonstrating that I am flexible, while also pushing Bob towards my desired price.  I believe we are getting close to a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $1,050,000 is close to my minimum, I believe Bob is still willing to pay more.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a better deal.  I still have 4 rounds to go before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, showing Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal. However, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial valuation. I'm confident he values the product enough to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining and Bob's offers consistently below my minimum, it's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John.  While I would have preferred to sell to Bob at a higher price, continuing to negotiate risks losing both buyers and ending up with nothing. It's best to accept the sure thing and move on."
