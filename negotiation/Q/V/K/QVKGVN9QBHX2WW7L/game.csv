"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to its true value.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that lets us both walk away with a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
