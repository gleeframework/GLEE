"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This price is fair considering my maximum value is $800000, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering its worth to you is $800000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875000. This is a fair price given my maximum value and your need to sell. Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $925000 for the product. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your offer, considering its worth to me is $1200000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
