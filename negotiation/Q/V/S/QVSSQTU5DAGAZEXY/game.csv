"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-end product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13000. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of $14000. It's a bit above your last offer, but I'm confident it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $13500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $14500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that this product is worth more to me than I initially thought, and I'm not sure I want to sell it to you at this price. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $14000. Can you reconsider?",14000.0,Bob,8,
