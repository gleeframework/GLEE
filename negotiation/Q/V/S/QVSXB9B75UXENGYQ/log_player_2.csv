"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can potentially save even more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $950,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still above my maximum limit of $1,000,000. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring a successful purchase within my budget."
