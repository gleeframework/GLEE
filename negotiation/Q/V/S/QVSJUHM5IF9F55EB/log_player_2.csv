"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product, but I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my bottom line, I'd be willing to accept $1,275,000. This offer reflects the product's true value while recognizing your budget concerns.

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,250,000.  It's within my budget and I've already made significant progress in the negotiation.  Accepting this offer saves me money compared to buying from John."
