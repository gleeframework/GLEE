Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
