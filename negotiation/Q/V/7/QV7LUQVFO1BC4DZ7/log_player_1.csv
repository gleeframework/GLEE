{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I can always come down.  I'm also including a friendly message to establish a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $13,500 is a decent price and closer to my target than John's offer.  It's important to be flexible in negotiations, and this seems like a good compromise."
