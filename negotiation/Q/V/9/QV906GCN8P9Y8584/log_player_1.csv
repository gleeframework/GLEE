Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.  
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to reinforce the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Backup Plan:** It's important to remember John's offer ($800,000) is the absolute minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to secure a significantly higher profit."
