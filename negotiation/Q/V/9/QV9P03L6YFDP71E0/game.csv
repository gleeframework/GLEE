"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a great deal for you, and it works for me.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? It's a bit closer to your original offer, and I think it's still a good compromise for both of us.",132.0,Bob,4,
