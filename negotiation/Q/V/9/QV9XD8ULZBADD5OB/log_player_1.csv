"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $110 is quite a bit lower than my initial ask, but it's still a significant profit above my minimum. I'll take it.
