``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's attractive enough to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $1,075,000 still isn't where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This would be a great outcome for both of us, giving you a substantial discount and me a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I am committed to getting as close to my desired price as possible. I will continue to negotiate with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is a good compromise that gives you a great deal while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,125,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at a price that I can accept. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and worth accepting. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John, which would be a better outcome, but I believe I can make a profit even with this offer."
