Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [Product Name].  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but we have a good chance of landing somewhere above our minimum.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives us a strong fallback position. This allows us to be more confident in our negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he is for the product. If we had more information, we might adjust our approach."
