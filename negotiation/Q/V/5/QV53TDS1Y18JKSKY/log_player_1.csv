Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is at the very top of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. This would allow me to secure the product while still staying within my financial constraints. Please let me know if this price works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
