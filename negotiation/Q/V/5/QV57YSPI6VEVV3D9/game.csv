"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount, but I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,000,000?  This offer reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
