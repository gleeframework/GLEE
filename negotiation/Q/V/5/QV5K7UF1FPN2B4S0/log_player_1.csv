"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to start high, we don't want to completely alienate Bob with an unrealistic price. $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above his perceived value. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Setting a collaborative and positive tone is important to encourage a productive negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,100,000 is significantly outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my own valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more agreeable figure. I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob, or I can always fall back on selling to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** By making a counteroffer, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, my price reduction is still a strong signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price dramatically lower than my minimum.
* **Strategic Reduction:** The counteroffer is a significant decrease from my initial price but still a good distance from Bob's offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while leaving room for further adjustments.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** Reminding Bob that I'm seeking a win-win outcome encourages him to make a more competitive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. To move forward, I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and my own valuation. Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $900,000 is still a significant way off from my $1,200,000 walk-away point. I believe Bob has room to move, and I'm willing to counter in the next round to try and close the gap. I'm still confident in my ability to either negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. I believe this offer reflects the true value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer significantly narrows the gap between our positions. It shows Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement but also holds firm on achieving a price closer to my target.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By suggesting we ""close this deal,"" I'm injecting a subtle sense of urgency into the negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  I'm reiterating that this is a fair price for both parties, emphasizing the mutually beneficial outcome we both desire."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise.  $975,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which I believe is a fair and realistic price for both of us. This demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal, let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to an acceptable range, I believe there is still some room for negotiation. We are only $50,000 apart, but those dollars matter. I'm willing to push a little further in the next round to try and secure a slightly better deal. I'm balancing the potential for a higher payout from Bob against the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I understand you're trying to make this work, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. My final offer is $950,000. This is a substantial discount from my initial asking price and a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's seal the deal."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm adding a layer of seriousness and suggesting that I won't go any lower. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm compromising by meeting Bob in the middle of the remaining gap.  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Call to Action:** The phrase ""seal the deal"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a final decision. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only three rounds left, I need to push for a decision and consider my alternative option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your final offer. However, $950,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer a final price of $935,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to the final rounds, and the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are diminishing. 
* **Strong Offer:** $935,000 is a good offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and a respectable return.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to push Bob risks losing the deal entirely. He might walk away, leaving me to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000. Accepting a solid offer now guarantees a good profit."
