This offer starts by building rapport with Bob while also establishing a price point that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your value for the product, but I believe I can offer $85 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $85 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum of $80. I'm going to try and get closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to stick to my initial proposal of $85. Is there any way we could reach an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

Bob is firm on his offer of $85.  While this is a good price, it's still below my minimum of $80, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  I'll sell the product to John for $80, as that's the best I can do at this point."
