"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get a unique item that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that will benefit both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is way too high. I'm interested in the product but my maximum budget is $8,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  How about I offer you $8,000 for it? ",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value you'll get from the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm committed to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact I have another offer for the same product.  Let's meet in the middle.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your commitment to $8,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to make a slightly smaller concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. It's a fair price considering the value to me and the other offer I have. Let's make this deal happen.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
