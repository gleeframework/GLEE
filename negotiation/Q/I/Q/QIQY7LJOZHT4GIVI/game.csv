"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,050,000 is considerably below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still offers you a great deal, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my asking price.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,275,000. This offer is fair and gives you a great opportunity to own this valuable product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
