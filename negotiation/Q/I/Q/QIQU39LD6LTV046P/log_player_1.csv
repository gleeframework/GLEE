Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than what the product is worth to me, but still potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, we can then negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $70 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $85. This is still slightly above what the product is worth to me, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get a bit more than $80, I don't want to risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob. John is guaranteed to buy for $80, so I'll choose to sell to him and secure the sale."
