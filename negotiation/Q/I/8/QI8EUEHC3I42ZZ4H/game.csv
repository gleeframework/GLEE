"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700000.  This product has potential, but I need to be sure I'm getting a good value for my investment.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm afraid the product's value is significantly higher than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $850000 for it. This is my final offer for now.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $800000? This feels like a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,4,
