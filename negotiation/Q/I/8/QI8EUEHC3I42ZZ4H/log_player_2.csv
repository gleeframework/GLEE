"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can get it for a lower price by counter-offering. There's a lot of room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000.  This product has potential, but I need to be sure I'm getting a good value for my investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This demonstrates your desire to get a good deal and starts the negotiation with a strong stance.
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing value and investment. This makes your offer feel more reasonable and less arbitrary. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with a question invites Alice to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm afraid the product's value is significantly higher than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $850000 for it. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than your initial counteroffer, it's still significantly lower than your maximum budget. You still have room for negotiation and potentially get a better price.  You have 7 rounds left, and you can still leverage the threat of buying from John to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? This feels like a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Fairness:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Alice halfway. The language emphasizes fairness and a win-win outcome.
* **Specific Price:**  Instead of a vague counter-offer, this proposes a concrete price, making it clear and easy for Alice to consider.
* **Positive Framing:**  ""Walk away happy"" suggests a positive outcome for both parties, encouraging Alice to accept."
