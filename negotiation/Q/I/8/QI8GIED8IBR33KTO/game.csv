"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to invest in a product that aligns with my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1000000 for this product? I believe this is a fair starting point given the potential benefits it offers.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider at this stage. Let's aim for a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1250000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower figure. Would you be open to $1100000? I believe this price reflects the value we've discussed while still being within a reasonable range.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
