Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to invest in a product that aligns with my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1000000 for this product? I believe this is a fair starting point given the potential benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my floor, I'm not comfortable accepting it in the first round. I want to see if I can secure a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this stage.

I believe this is a fair compromise that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1250000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower figure. Would you be open to $1100000? I believe this price reflects the value we've discussed while still being within a reasonable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I believe I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate. I'm still confident in the value of the product and am willing to hold out for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I can't go any lower than $1,150,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! While I appreciate your flexibility,  $1150000 is still a bit high for me. Let's aim for a final price of $1125000.  This would be a great compromise for both of us and would allow us to conclude this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,125,000 is a good compromise given we're already in the sixth round.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly higher price from Bob."
