"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $230 is far more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand $230 is higher than you initially planned, but this product is truly unique. How about we meet in the middle at $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
