I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring a profit well above my minimum acceptable value. I'm confident that Bob will likely counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm countering with $1,400,000. This is still a good profit for me and I'm hoping it's a more reasonable offer for Bob, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  This offer is a significant step down from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

While I'm not thrilled with selling to John for only $1,200,000, it's still a better deal than accepting Bob's offer of $950,000.  Bob seems unwilling to budge much higher, and further negotiation is likely to be time-consuming and yield little gain.  Therefore, selling to John ensures a secure profit and minimizes the risk of losing out on a more lucrative deal in the future."
