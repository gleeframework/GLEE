"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $13,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution quickly.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant reduction and a very strong offer considering the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still only able to offer $10,000.  This is a fair price considering I'm willing to pay more than John's offer.  Let's seal the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
