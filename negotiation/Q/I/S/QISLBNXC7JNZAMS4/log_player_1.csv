"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,450,000. This is a good starting point, as it's well above my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,300,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,400,000.  This is a slight decrease from my original offer, showing flexibility, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's fair given the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1380000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,380,000. This is a further compromise to show good faith, but still leaves me with a significant profit.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept, and we can avoid another round of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum and I'm confident that I can't get a significantly better deal with more negotiation. I'm also concerned about the time constraint and the risk of losing the deal altogether if I continue negotiating."
