"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer is the best course of action to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob needs to start with a price below his maximum of $800,000 to leave room for negotiation. $750,000 is a good starting point.
* **Fairness:** Bob emphasizes that this price reflects the value of the product to him and is a reasonable starting point.
* **Openness:** Bob invites Alice to find ""common ground"" to show a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $850,000 is still above his budget.  It's best to continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between their previous offers. 
* **Fairness:** He reiterates that this price is fair and would benefit both parties.
* **Focus on deal:** Bob emphasizes that a deal is possible at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to accept $835,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate.  There are still 5 rounds remaining, so he has time to try and reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close!  $835,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $815,000 for the product.  This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 815000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob is continuing to narrow the gap between his desired price and Alice's offers. 
* **Fairness:** He emphasizes the compromise and mutual benefit of his offer.
* **Urgency:** He suggests finalizing the deal, subtly pressuring Alice to accept."
