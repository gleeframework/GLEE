"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that would be worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you, and still allows me to make a good profit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than John's price of $10,000.  There's a chance I could get a better price by rejecting and seeing if Alice will come down."
