"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The goal is to save as much money as possible.**  $140 is still too high.
* **There are more rounds available.** This gives me room to negotiate a better price. 
* **John's price is a safety net.** If negotiations with Alice fail, I can still get the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing my intent to negotiate.
* **Reasonable difference:** $130 is still within the range where Alice might consider it, as she values the product at $120.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility:** She's lowered her price from $140 to $135.
* **The price is close to my target:**  $135 is only $15 more than my initial counteroffer and within my budget.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk that further negotiation might result in Alice rejecting my counteroffer again, potentially leading to higher prices.

This offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to take it to avoid the potential risk of a longer negotiation."
