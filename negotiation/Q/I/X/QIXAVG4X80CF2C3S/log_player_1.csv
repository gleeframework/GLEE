""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice starts with a price closer to her minimum ($12,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above Bob's Valuation:** While the price is above Bob's perceived value, it's presented as a ""fair"" starting point. This might work if Bob isn't entirely sure of the market or is willing to pay a premium.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even lower to avoid losing him entirely.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell quickly, she might be more flexible with the price.
 
This offer balances trying to get the best price from Bob while also acknowledging that Alice has a guaranteed backup offer."
