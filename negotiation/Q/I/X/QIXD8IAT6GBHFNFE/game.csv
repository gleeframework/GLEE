"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $170? That's a significant discount from my initial offer.",170.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $170 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
