"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value than Bob's, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's potential benefits to Bob might make him more willing to pay a higher price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which is important in a negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price. I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price that's closer to my value and  still leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  I'm using a friendly tone and open-ended question to encourage continued negotiation.
* **Balanced Position:**  $8,500 is a midpoint between my ideal price and Bob's offer, showing I'm taking his offer seriously but still aiming for a good deal. 
* **John as Leverage:**  I'm confident in my backup option with John, which gives me confidence in pushing for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:**  $8,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and allows me to close the deal without risking a breakdown in negotiations.
* **Time is a Factor:** We're nearing the middle of the 10 rounds, and it's important to avoid letting the negotiation drag on too long.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially get a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'd be forced to sell to John for less than my ideal price. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John is a guaranteed $10,000, but it's slightly lower than Bob's offer. 
* **Good Outcome:**  $8,000 is a fair price for both parties, and it allows me to close the deal relatively quickly."
