{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price, making it seem like a good deal for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob and the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Having a backup:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than the $1,200,000 value to Bob. 
* **Room for counteroffer:**  I can likely get a higher price from Bob if I counteroffer.
* **John is a safe option:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a good outcome and a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but not by too much.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and focused on finding a solution.
* **Still above minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $1,175,000 is still below the product's value to Bob and significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  I can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer and pushing a bit further. 
* **John remains a safe backup:** If the negotiations with Bob fall apart, selling to John is still a very good option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,175,000 is closer, we're still a bit apart.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this price fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (but not too much):** I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise, but still positions me to get a better price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I'm reminding Bob that the price is still fair given the product's value to him.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  I'm suggesting that $1,250,000 is a good compromise, implying that I might not be willing to go lower. This could encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, so I'm not taking a significant loss."
