Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. It signals the product's value to you.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The slightly unusual price of $19,000 might make Bob perceive the deal as more considered than a round number like $20,000.

**Important:**  It's crucial to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your approach accordingly. If he seems hesitant at $19,000, you can always negotiate down towards his perceived value of $10,000 while still aiming to stay above your minimum of $15,000."
