Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is still above my minimum value but lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this signals my willingness to negotiate while still holding a firm stance on the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident that I can get at least my minimum value from John, so it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll sell to John."
