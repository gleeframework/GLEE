"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not desperate to sell and have the safety net of selling to John. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8500, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle at $8750. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$8,750 is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  Bob seems willing to negotiate, and I think we can find a price closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $8,900?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we could close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8750, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8925. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,925. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,925
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,925 is very close to my target price of $9,000.  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's likely Bob won't budge further.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a better price than selling to John, and it closes the deal."
