"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $8000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $9000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the discount, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8500, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle at $8750. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8750 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $9000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $8900?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we could close this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8750, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8925. Would you be willing to accept that price?",8925.0,Bob,6,
