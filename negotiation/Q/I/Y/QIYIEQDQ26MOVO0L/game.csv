"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you'd like to meet in the middle, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I think I could only justify spending $875,000 on this.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit short on my target. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I can do $890,000, but that's the best I can offer.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $890,000, but I'm still not sure I can make that work for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $900,000. That's my final offer, what do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
