I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, and I'm hoping to capitalize on any perceived value Bob might see in it."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,800,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a compromise."

I'm counteroffering with $1,900,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still believe the product is worth more than Bob's offer. It's a compromise that hopefully leads to a final agreement."
