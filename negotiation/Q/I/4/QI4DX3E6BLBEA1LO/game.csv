"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,075,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,070,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations.",1070000.0,Alice,5,
