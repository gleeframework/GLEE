"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $500000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $750000. This price reflects the value I've placed on it, and I believe it's still fair considering its potential.  Let's find a middle ground here.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, and I respect that. However, $675000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $725000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,
