"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $750,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable for me.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're close to your target price, but I'm not ready to accept $800,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $825,000 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
