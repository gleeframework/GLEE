{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it's a fantastic deal, and you won't be disappointed."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. His response will provide valuable information for subsequent negotiation steps.

It's important to remember that this is just the opening move. You have the flexibility to adjust your price based on Bob's reactions and counteroffers. Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a price below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own stated value for the product ($80). Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for you. 

It's clear that there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this low offer, you signal to Bob that you're serious about getting a fair price for your product. You can now propose a counteroffer that bridges the gap and moves the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $60 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a common negotiation tactic â€“ finding a compromise halfway between the two previous prices ($120 and $60). 
* **Psychological Impact:**  While it's not a true middle ground in terms of your desired profit, it creates the perception of fairness and might encourage Bob to engage more constructively. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price point still allows you to make a profit ($10) while potentially being more appealing to Bob than your initial offer. 

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation forward while still aiming for a price that's beneficial for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. How about $75? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is slightly below your ideal price, it's essential to consider the following:

* **Profitable:** You'll still make a profit of $75 (sale price) - $80 (your value) = -$5. This is a small loss, but given the alternatives, it's reasonable.
* **Time Value:** Continuing negotiations takes time and effort. Accepting now secures a sale and allows you to move on to other opportunities. 
* **Bob's Limit:**  Bob's offer of $75, while closer to his value, still suggests he might not be willing to go much higher.

Accepting $75 represents a pragmatic compromise. You minimize potential losses while avoiding the risk of prolonged negotiations that might not yield a significantly better outcome."
