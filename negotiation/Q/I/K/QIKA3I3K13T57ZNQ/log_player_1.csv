Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Here's why:

* **Maximizing profit:** I want to earn as much as possible, so I'm starting high. 
* **Testing the waters:** By offering a higher price, I can gauge Bob's interest and see how much he values the product.
* **Negotiation room:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have room to negotiate down to a price closer to my minimum acceptable price if needed.

**Important Considerations:**

* I don't know the value of the product to Bob, so this offer is a gamble. 
* It's possible that Bob will reject the offer, leaving me with John's $1,500,000 offer.
* If I believe Bob truly values the product at a higher price, I could increase the offer even further."
