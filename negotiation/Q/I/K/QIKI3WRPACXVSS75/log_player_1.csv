Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($130) gives you a high chance of securing a sale and a good profit margin. 
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high offer that Bob is likely to accept and a price that yields a significant profit for you."
