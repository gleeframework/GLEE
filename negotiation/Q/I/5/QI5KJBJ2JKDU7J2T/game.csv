"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll see its worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While I see the value in the product, I can't justify going above $9,000.  Do you think that might work?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to make this work and $9,000 is still quite low.  To be honest, $10,500 is the absolute lowest I can go.  It's a fantastic deal for this product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
