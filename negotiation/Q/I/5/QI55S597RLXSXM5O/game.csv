"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $22,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter. $18,000 is still a bit higher than I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I think that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's split the difference again. Would $15,000 work for you?",15000.0,Alice,5,
