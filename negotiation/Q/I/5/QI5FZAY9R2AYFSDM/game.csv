"Alice, your product is appealing, but $1400000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and would be a good starting point for us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept it. $1100000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value your product highly, but $1250000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1175000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution.  How about we settle for $1200000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of my product while staying within your budget. It's a win-win for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
