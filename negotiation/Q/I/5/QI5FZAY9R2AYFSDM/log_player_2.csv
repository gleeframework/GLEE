Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is appealing, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and would be a good starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept it. $1100000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value your product highly, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution.  How about we settle for $1200000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of my product while staying within your budget. It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
