"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's clear we need to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer allows me to make a counteroffer and attempt to reach a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $20,000 is far above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still too high for me. While she's willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go beyond my budget.  John is offering the product at my maximum price, so I'll go with his offer."
