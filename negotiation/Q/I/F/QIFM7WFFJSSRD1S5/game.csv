"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Bob,4,
