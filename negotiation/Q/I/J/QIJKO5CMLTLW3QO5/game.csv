"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,750 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,875? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $10,750 again, as I mentioned earlier. Can we revisit that price?",10750.0,Bob,6,
