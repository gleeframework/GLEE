"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! I'm thinking of starting at $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's best to counter-offer and see if she's willing to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay around $100. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

Reasoning: We start with a significantly lower counter-offer than Alice's initial price. This strategy serves two purposes: 

1. **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  It allows us to understand how much Alice is willing to budge from her initial price.  
2. **Leaves room for negotiation:** Even if she rejects this offer, it gives us space to gradually increase our offer throughout the remaining rounds. 

The tone is polite and shows interest while firmly stating our budget limitations."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to your acceptable price range, $140 is still above your $120 limit. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

Reasoning: 

* **Strategic increase:** We're moving closer to our maximum budget but still leaving some room for negotiation in case Alice rejects this offer. 
* **Sense of urgency:** By stating you're ""ready to buy right now,"" we create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept.
* **Fairness emphasis:** Mentioning ""fair price"" subtly anchors the negotiation around our offer, even though it's still significantly lower than her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $130. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but we're still above our maximum budget. We're also getting close to the point where it might be better to go with John's offer.  We'll make one more counteroffer before considering that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $120 is the absolute maximum I can spend. If you're okay with that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** We've reached our absolute limit. This message clearly conveys that this is our best and final price.
* **Alternative option:** By mentioning ""exploring other options"" (John), we subtly signal that Alice risks losing the sale if she doesn't accept.
* **Respectful but firm:**  We maintain a polite and respectful tone while standing firm on our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you've reached your limit, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $140. I'm willing to make one more compromise at $125, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to walk away. Alice seems firm at $125, which is above your budget. You've negotiated well, but John's offer of $120 is a better deal at this point."
