{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its significant value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1000000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's within the 10 rounds allowed. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on the deal."
