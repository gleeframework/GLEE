"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's but not ideal.**  You can get the product for $1,200,000 from Alice, which is cheaper than John's $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You want to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still above her minimum of $1,000,000. 

By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  You want to start with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, showing your intention to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  $1,050,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's closer to Alice's minimum value of $1,000,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation.

By offering $1,050,000, you're showing that you're serious about getting the product at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Alice is now offering $1,300,000, which is still cheaper than John's $1,500,000.
* **Limited potential for further negotiation.**  While you could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice might be unwilling to go lower.  You've already rejected one offer, and her counteroffer shows she's not willing to drop her price significantly. 

It's more prudent to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price.  There's a good chance that further negotiation would only lead to a longer process with an uncertain outcome."
