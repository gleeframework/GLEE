Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer sets the price at $1,500,000.  Here's the reasoning:

* **Potential Upside:**  If Bob values the product at more than $1,500,000, you'll make a profit beyond your minimum acceptable price.
* **Minimizing Risk:** The offer is high enough to incentivize Bob but also provides a safety net. If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for your minimum price, ensuring no loss.

Of course, there's no guarantee Bob will accept, but this strategy balances maximizing your profit with minimizing your risk."
