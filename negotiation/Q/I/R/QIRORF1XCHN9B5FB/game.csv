"I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you closer to your target. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000.",8000.0,Alice,5,
