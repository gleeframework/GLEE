Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price, knowing it's more than Bob values it. This forces him to either accept and make a profit, or reject and start the negotiation process.  I'm willing to engage with him, but also have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to make a lower offer immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to keep negotiating. $950,000 is a good middle ground between our initial positions, and I believe there's room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my initial asking price, $900,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my minimum value than my previous counteroffer and ensures I get a good price while also avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing out on the sale entirely."
