"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $80 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. To ensure we both achieve a satisfactory outcome, I am proposing a price of $90 for the product. This offers a slight increase from your offer while still maintaining a fair value for us. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget and expectations.",90.0,Alice,3,
