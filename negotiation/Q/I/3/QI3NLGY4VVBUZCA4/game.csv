"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1500000 for it. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential return will be substantial. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $900000 is a considerable amount, it's unfortunately below my minimum threshold for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value I'm offering.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1200000 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'm thinking of offering $950000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
