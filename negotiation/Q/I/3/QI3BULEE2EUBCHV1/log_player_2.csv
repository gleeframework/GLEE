"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a lower price while still leaving room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows he's serious about buying, but also willing to push for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would allow us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible.  While $13,500 is closer to his target, he can likely still negotiate a lower price.  He's only in round 3, so there's still time to push for a better offer before having to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $13,250, which would split the difference between our last offers.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground again, showing he's willing to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.  He's increasing his offer by a smaller amount this time, showing he's getting closer to his limit but not giving in completely."
