"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be very beneficial to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation, aiming to get a price as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while still ensuring a profit above my minimum of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems valuable, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price. I need to ensure a profit of at least $800,000 to make this worthwhile, and will counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's still a significant profit for you and allows me to make a fair return on my investment. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875000, which is a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is still below my ideal price, it's above my minimum threshold of $800,000.  Accepting Bob's offer in this round ensures a profit and avoids risking further negotiation."
