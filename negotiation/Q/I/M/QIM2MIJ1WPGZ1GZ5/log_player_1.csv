Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a high offer (but below your guaranteed sale price) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning a ""discounted price"" and ""significant value"" aims to frame the offer positively, even though it's significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired minimum price. This gives you leverage. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits. Gathering more information about Bob could lead to a more tailored and potentially more profitable approach."
