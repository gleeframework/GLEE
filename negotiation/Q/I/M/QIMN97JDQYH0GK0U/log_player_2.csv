"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $119.  While this is a good deal, Bob can get the product from John for $120. Since Bob wants to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the better choice."
