``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still allows for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product and expresses confidence in reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'll try to push for a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,250 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired value. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
