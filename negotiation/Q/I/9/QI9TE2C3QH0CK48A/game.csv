"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $22000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for in the market. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $18000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $20000. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the conversation. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're at a price that works for both of us. I'm thinking of $19500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value and what I'm looking for.",19500.0,Alice,7,
