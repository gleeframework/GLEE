"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000, but I'm also considering buying from John for $800,000. Can you think about going lower, or is that not possible?",925000.0,Bob,4,
