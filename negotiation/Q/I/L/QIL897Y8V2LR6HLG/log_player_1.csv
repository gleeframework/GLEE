{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to consider this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will **reject** Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still secure a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,112,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,112,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer.  $1,112,500 is a good compromise and is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer outweighs the potential gain."
