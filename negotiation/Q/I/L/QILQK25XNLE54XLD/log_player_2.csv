# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $11,000.  Since you can buy it from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses in the negotiation with Alice."
