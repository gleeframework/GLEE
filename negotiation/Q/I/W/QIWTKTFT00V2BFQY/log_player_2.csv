{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget.  It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that I believe is reasonable.  This will give us room to negotiate.  I'm aiming to get a price closer to my ideal range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but closer.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get an even lower price.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying but still want a good deal. This is a compromise between my initial counteroffer and her current offer, hoping to find a meeting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired range, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price. I have enough rounds left to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 610000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer that's just slightly below Alice's offer. This shows good faith and willingness to close the deal, but I'm still trying to get the best possible price.  If Alice rejects this, I'll likely move to John's offer to avoid further haggling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $620,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $620,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my last counteroffer.  While I'd still like to get a lower price, we're only $10,000 apart.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, and John's offer is significantly higher. I'm better off accepting this offer and securing the product."
