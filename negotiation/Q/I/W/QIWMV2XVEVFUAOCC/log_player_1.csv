Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.
