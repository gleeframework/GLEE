"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I could easily sell it to someone else for $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from $9,000 to $8,500. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I could also buy it from John for $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200, which is a compromise for both of us.  Remember, selling to John would net me $8,000, so this is really my last offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7,900. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7900.0,Bob,6,
