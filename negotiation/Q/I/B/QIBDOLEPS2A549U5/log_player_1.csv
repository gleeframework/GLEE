Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives me a decent profit while keeping the door open to a possible better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's better to try and negotiate a better price with him. I can explore offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,100,000? This price is still fair for both of us and allows for a successful deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous prices. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's better to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to Bob or having to sell to John for a lower price."
