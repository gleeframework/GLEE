"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of $14,000. It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer you $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
