"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This product will really exceed your expectations.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Bob.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I can't go as low as $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? That's a very competitive price for a product of this quality.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,000. Can we meet at that price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
