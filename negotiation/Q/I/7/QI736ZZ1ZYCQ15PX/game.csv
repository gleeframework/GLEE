"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I cannot accept your offer of $750000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $687500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $795000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
