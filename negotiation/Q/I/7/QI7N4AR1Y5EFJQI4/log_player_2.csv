Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. However, I have to say that $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a personalized consultation to ensure you get the most out of the product. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000, and I'm throwing in a 10-year warranty, a personalized consultation, and a free upgrade to a premium package. This is my last chance to get a better price, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're running out of rounds, and Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  
* **Acceptable Price:** $1,100,000 is a decent price, especially considering it's significantly less than John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Added Value:** The 10-year warranty, consultation, and premium upgrade add extra value to the deal, making it more appealing than before.

While holding out for $1,000,000 is tempting, it risks Alice walking away. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher cost."
