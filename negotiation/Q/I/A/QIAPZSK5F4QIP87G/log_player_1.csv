Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with my desired price of $1,000,000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate up a bit.  If he doesn't accept this initial offer, I'll have to see if we can come to a compromise or if I'm better off selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is still a decent amount of money, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I'm going to counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than what Bob is offering.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $900,000 for the product. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still closer to my desired price than his offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise that might be appealing to Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
