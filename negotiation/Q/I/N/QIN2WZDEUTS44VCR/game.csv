"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire for a competitive price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 falls short of what I believe is a fair reflection of this product's value.  Would you be willing to consider $1,275,000?  This feels like a reasonable compromise.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a deal that works for both of us. I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be honest â€“ I can't go any lower than $1,250,000. This is my absolute best offer. If you can meet this price, I'm happy to finalize the sale. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
