{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $1,200,000 is still above your target price.  Let's see if we can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

Let's start with a strong counteroffer.  $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still within a range that might be acceptable to her.  We'll see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is still quite high, but we're seeing movement. Let's try another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

We're getting closer, but Alice is still too high. We need to keep pushing for a better price. Let's try another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

Let's go a little higher with our offer, but still keep it within our budget.  $1,000,000 is a good middle ground that might convince Alice to come down a bit more."

We've reached a point where it's unlikely Alice will come down to our price range.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
