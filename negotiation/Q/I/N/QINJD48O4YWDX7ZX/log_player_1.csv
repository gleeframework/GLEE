Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** $12,000 is a good starting point that allows for multiple rounds of negotiation if needed.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I'm ready to sell to John for $15,000, securing my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm not in a desperate position, so I can afford to push for a higher price, knowing I have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I frame the offer as ""fair"" to both of us, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Final Push:**  $10,500 is still a decent profit for me, but it's closer to Bob's perceived value, increasing the chances of acceptance. 
* **No Backdown:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move forward with selling to John, ensuring I still make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,500 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation because I believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **John's offer is secure:** My safety net with John's offer allows me to take this risk.  

I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still within a reasonable range, hoping to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final counteroffer, showing I'm willing to make a concession while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Lowering the Price:**  By reducing my price to $10,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a desire to close the deal.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I reiterate the ""fair deal"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Last Chance:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move forward with selling to John, as $10,000 is still a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,750? I really think this is the best we can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, $9,750 is still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Another round of counteroffers could lead to a stalemate or further price reductions that wouldn't be profitable for me.
* **John's offer is the best option:**  At this point, selling to John for $15,000 ensures a much better profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

I'm willing to walk away from the deal with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
