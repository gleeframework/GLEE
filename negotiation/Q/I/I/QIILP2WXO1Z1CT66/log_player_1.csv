{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  I also want to emphasize the value of the product to him in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
