``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price slightly above my minimum while still being attractive to Bob. I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation, but ultimately my goal is to get the highest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still a good starting point for further negotiation.  I'm going to reject his offer and send a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and go with $775,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value to you."", ""product_price"": 775000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price. How about we settle at $740,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $740,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer than before. I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer.  While I'd like more, I need to be mindful of the possibility that Bob will walk away, and John is always a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle at $760,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's only $40,000 away from your last offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 760000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal of $800,000, the negotiations with Bob have reached a stalemate.  He's not willing to budge much further, and I don't want to risk losing him altogether.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so that's the best option at this point."
