"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value to you, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800,000.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant step closer to your value. This allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can close this gap.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,5,
