This offer starts the negotiation by proposing a price slightly above the product's worth to Bob. This strategy leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, as a potential deal with John is always available if we can't agree.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000.
