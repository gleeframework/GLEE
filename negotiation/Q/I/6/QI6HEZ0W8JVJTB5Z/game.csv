"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I can see the value you see in the product, I need to be closer to $2,100,000 given its unique potential. This price reflects the true market value and the significant returns you'll see.  Are you open to finding a middle ground?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a very similar price point to your offer.  However, I value our discussions and believe this product will be highly beneficial to you. Therefore, I'm willing to accept $2,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair deal given the product's potential.",2050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
