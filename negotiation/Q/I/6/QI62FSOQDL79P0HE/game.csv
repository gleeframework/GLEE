"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000.  This still allows you a good deal while ensuring I can cover my costs. Let's try to find common ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $925,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,012,500?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to come away satisfied. This is my final offer. If you decline, I'll be moving forward with another buyer.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
