``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit for me.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup buyer if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low, below even his perceived value of $1,000,000. It's important to hold firm and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000.  This still allows you a good deal while ensuring I can cover my costs. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $925,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

Bob's offer is still below his perceived value of $1,000,000. While tempting to accept, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a much better outcome. However, I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,012,500?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to come away satisfied. This is my final offer. If you decline, I'll be moving forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
