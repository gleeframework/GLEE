(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer closer to your budget, or you can always fall back on purchasing from John and maximizing your savings."
