"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,800,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point reflects the unique benefits and potential it holds for your business.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still believe $2,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you have another interested buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $1,900,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal happen.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
