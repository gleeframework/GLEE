"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is lower than John's price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal from Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:** Acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest.
* **Signals willingness to negotiate:** Doesn't immediately accept or reject, showing flexibility.
* **Aims for a good deal:** The price of $110 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still a profitable amount for her (above her $120 value). 
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  There's space between $110 and $140 if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $110 is quite a bit below its value. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to your desired price range. While you could try to haggle further, $130 is a reasonable price and a decent compromise. Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice withdrawing the offer or the negotiations stalling."
