"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $160. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $165. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the value the product brings.",165.0,Alice,5,
