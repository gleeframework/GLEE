Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and potentially lower my offer to a more acceptable price. I'll be closely watching his counteroffers and considering if a better price is available from John before risking losing the sale to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm going to try and get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer with a price between his offer and my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm offering $1,900,000. This is a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous offer, and it's still a decent amount above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than he's offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him.  Also, I'm starting to worry about John potentially changing his mind or finding a better deal. It's time to secure the sale."
