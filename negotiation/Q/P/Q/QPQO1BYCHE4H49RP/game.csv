"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair.  $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,875? It's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,
