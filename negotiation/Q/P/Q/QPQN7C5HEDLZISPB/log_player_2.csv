Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer is now just $25,000 away from my ideal price. I'm going to make a final counteroffer to meet halfway.

If she rejects, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John in the next round."
