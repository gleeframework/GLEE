"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm!  While $950,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $875,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
