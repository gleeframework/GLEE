,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500? This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit.  Let's find a way to make this work.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your $10,000 offer. While that's not workable for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $11,000.  This is a significant reduction from my last offer, and it's the closest I can come without jeopardizing my own financial goals. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort in trying to meet my budget. However, I'm still unable to go beyond $10,000 for the product. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
