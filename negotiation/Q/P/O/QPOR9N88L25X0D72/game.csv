"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference again, how about $120?  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at $120. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $127? It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to what I need to make it worth my while.",127.0,Alice,5,
