"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value we've both acknowledged.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $950,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,000,000. This offer takes into account our discussions and represents a firm decision on my end. Let me know if this works for you so we can finalize things.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our discussions. Let me know if this works for you.",975000.0,Bob,6,
