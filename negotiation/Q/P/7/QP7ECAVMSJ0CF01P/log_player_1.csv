Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting high, I can gauge Bob's level of interest. If he immediately rejects the offer, I know I need to adjust significantly. If he counters, it indicates some level of interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** I always have John as a backup buyer at $100, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $95 is closer to his perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. By rejecting, I signal that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away for a better deal. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go quite that low. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  The $105 price point ensures I still make a profit and stay above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By countering, I keep the negotiation active and maintain some leverage. I haven't committed to John yet, so I have the flexibility to see if Bob will agree to a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting his offer guarantees I make my desired profit and avoids the potential loss of both Bob and John as buyers."
