"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $200. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $150 and John's offer of $150.  It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within your acceptable range allows for negotiation. It aims to understand Alice's flexibility on price and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $100 is too low for me. Could you do $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer of $170 is closer to your budget, it's still above what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to potentially secure a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer aims for a compromise. It shows willingness to negotiate while still striving for a price significantly lower than Alice's current offer. 
* **Strategic positioning:** Offering $135 positions you well. It's above the midpoint between your initial offer ($100) and Alice's counteroffer ($170), suggesting flexibility on your part. However, it's still a good deal below John's price ($150)."
