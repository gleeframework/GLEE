{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum ($150) but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to do $125?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $125 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum.  Rejecting his offer gives you the opportunity to counter with a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $125 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $162.50? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 162.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. I'm still not comfortable going over $100. How about $110?  Let's see if we can reach a deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $110 is still too low for me.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I can guarantee myself $150 by selling to John."
