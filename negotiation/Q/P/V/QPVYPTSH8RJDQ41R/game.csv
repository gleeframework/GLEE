"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is way beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $19,000. This is a compromise, reflecting the product's worth.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $19,000 is still too high for me.  Could you do $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant reduction.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer. I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're nearing a good compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $14,500? This is my final offer, as I need to consider other potential buyers if we can't agree here.",14500.0,Alice,7,
