"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. This is a great deal for something you'll get so much use out of. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $150. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, so rejecting her initial offer might lead to a better deal."
