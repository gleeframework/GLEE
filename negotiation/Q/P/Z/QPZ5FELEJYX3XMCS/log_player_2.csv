# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm going to try and negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  John is always a backup option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to make the purchase.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is now only $25,000 away from my target price.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of time and rounds.  It's better to go with the sure thing and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  I've already saved a significant amount by negotiating with Alice, and continuing the negotiation risks me losing out on the deal altogether."
