"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($800,000), and also lower than your maximum budget ($800,000). It's a good starting point for negotiation, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, I believe your starting price is a bit too aggressive. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to offer $700,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us. I'm eager to move forward with this deal if you're agreeable."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value and the time we've invested in preparing it for sale, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is a good compromise. It's still a significant discount from the product's worth to her ($800,000), and it's within your budget. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely or having Alice raise her offer in subsequent rounds, potentially costing you more. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product for a reasonable price."
