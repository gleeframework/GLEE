{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $7,500 is a good price, but I want to see if I can get it lower.  I'm going to try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price closer to $5,000, but I'm willing to go up a bit if necessary."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}

**Reasoning:** Alice has already come down from $7,500 to $6,000, showing she's willing to negotiate. I'm increasing my offer slightly to $5,500, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $6,250 is a good price, but I think I can still get it lower. I'm going to continue negotiating.  I'm close to my target price range, so I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5750}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again slightly to $5,750. This is a good compromise, as it's halfway between my last offer and Alice's current offer. Hopefully, this will convince her to accept. If she rejects, I'll need to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  We've gone back and forth a few times, but the price isn't getting any lower. At this point, I'm concerned that we're reaching a stalemate, and I risk running out of rounds before getting a deal. John's offer is guaranteed, and while it's higher than I'd like, it's within my budget and ensures I get the product."
