"Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and offer it to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",10200.0,Alice,5,
