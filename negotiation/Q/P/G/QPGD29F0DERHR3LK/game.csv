"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still above your stated value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still not quite there on $900,000.  How about $875,000? It's closer to your value and closer to my target. Let's try to close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
