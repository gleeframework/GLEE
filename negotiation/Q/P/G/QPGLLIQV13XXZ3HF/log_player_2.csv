"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Since you're willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product, and John is selling it for that price, you might as well buy it from him. It's the same price, but you get to avoid the negotiation with Alice."
