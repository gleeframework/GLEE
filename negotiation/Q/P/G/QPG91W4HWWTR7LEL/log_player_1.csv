"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this is a fair offer, considering Bob's low initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his initial one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject it and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,100,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I would like to get a higher price, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
