{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you get a decent price.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This ensures that Bob understands the terms and can make an informed decision.

Remember, you can always adjust this offer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,200 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob. I'll sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
