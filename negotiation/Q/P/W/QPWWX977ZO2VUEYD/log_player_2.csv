{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $835,000, I'm only willing to spend a maximum of $800,000. Given that I'm not confident I can convince Alice to drop her price further, and I've already used several rounds of negotiation, I'm going to buy the product from John for $800,000.  This ensures I get the product at my target price and avoid further negotiation."
