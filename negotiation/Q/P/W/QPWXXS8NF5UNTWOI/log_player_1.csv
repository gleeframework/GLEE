Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to offer $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $11,500. We've gone back and forth, and he seems firmly planted at that price point.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of Bob not budging further.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal."
