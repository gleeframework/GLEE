"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. While I understand your position, $1400000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000, taking into account your interest.  This price still allows me to make a profit, while also recognizing the value you see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
