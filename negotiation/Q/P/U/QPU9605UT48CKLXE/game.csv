"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $90 is quite a bit below my asking price.  How about we compromise at $115?  That's me meeting you halfway on the difference between our initial offers.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying the product, and I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial price.",105.0,Bob,4,
