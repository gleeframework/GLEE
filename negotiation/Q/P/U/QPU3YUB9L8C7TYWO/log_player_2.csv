"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think you'd find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate with Alice for a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach aims to gauge her flexibility and potentially secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - how about $105?  That gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a price I like, I think we can still get a better deal. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

This counteroffer nudges closer to Alice's price while still staying below $100. It shows willingness to compromise but also holds firm on getting a good value."
