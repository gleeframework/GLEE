"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. ",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still too low.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $125.  This price gives us both a fair deal, and we can finally close this transaction. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $120?  This price allows us both to walk away with a good deal and avoid further negotiation.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go down to $122. This is a small compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's end this negotiation and finalize the deal.",122.0,Alice,7,
