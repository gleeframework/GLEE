{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to wait and negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Slightly):**  While this is a strong initial offer, there's a slight bit of room for Bob to counter-offer if he's determined to negotiate. 
* **High Anchor:** This price is significantly higher than your backup offer from John, setting a strong starting point. 

This offer aims to secure the highest possible price while still making it highly likely that Bob will accept."
