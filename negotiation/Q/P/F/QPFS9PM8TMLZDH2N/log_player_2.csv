"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000. It's a real steal, considering its value!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your limit, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price, especially since you've expressed an interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down to $14000. It's still a great deal for you, and it lets me keep the value of the product close to what it's worth to me. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $14,000, which is within my budget and a good deal.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go lower, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy from her altogether.  It's better to accept her offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
