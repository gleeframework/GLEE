"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to frame the product as a premium opportunity, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I want to maximize profit, I'm mindful of John's standing offer. This initial price leaves a substantial gap for negotiation, ensuring I don't push Bob away too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches his perceived value but is significantly below my minimum. Accepting would mean losing out on potential profit. While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,500,000 is a substantial sum, it doesn't fully reflect the true value and scarcity of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $2,000,000? I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, Maintain Strength:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but don't undervalue the product.  By coming down $250,000, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate while still holding a strong position above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Justification:**  I reiterate the product's unique qualities to justify the high price. ""Scarcity"" adds an element of urgency.
* **""Middle Ground"" Framing:** This language positions my counteroffer as a win-win solution, encouraging Bob to move closer to my price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, and Bob is clearly engaged.  While $1,750,000 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. It's still early in the negotiation (6 rounds left), and I'm aiming to get closer to $1,900,000 before considering John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me partway. Would you consider $1,900,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time for a Stronger Stance:** While I want to be flexible, I also need to signal that I'm firming up my position.  ""Final offer"" language adds weight to this counteroffer.
* **Slight Concession, Clear Target:** I'm coming down $100,000, showing movement but making it clear that $1,900,000 is my target price. 
* **Direct Appeal:**  By acknowledging Bob's seriousness, I'm aiming to build rapport and encourage him to finalize the deal at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay up to $1,750,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $1,775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob is clearly anchored at $1,750,000, and while I'd prefer $1,900,000, getting $1,775,000 is a strong outcome. It's significantly above my minimum and John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases. The additional potential gain isn't worth jeopardizing a good deal. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now saves time and allows me to move on to other opportunities, rather than potentially dragging this out for several more rounds with uncertain results."
