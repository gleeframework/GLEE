"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $8,000 to us and we believe it's equally valuable to you. To start, I'll offer it to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since he has 10 rounds and knows the product's worth to Alice, he can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $7,000 for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While we appreciate your interest in our product, we need to maintain our minimum price. I'd like to counter your offer with $7,200 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  He can likely get closer to his target price of $7,000 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $7,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and I offer $7,100? It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 7100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I propose $7,150 for the product. This is slightly above your last offer, while still being within our acceptable range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,150 is very close to Bob's target price of $7,000.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to further concessions, but it also risks a breakdown in the deal, leaving Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal and allows Bob to move on."
