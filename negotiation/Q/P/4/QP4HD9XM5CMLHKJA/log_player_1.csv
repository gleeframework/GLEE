Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $22,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher number. This can influence Bob's counteroffers to be closer to my desired range.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me leverage and confidence in the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is understandable, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I need to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a huge loss.  I'll make a counteroffer that brings the price down but keeps me above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 19000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer ($3,000 reduction) to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for the price (""true value""), subtly reinforcing that the product is worth a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My new price is still significantly above my minimum and closer to my starting point, leaving room for further negotiation while keeping me in a profitable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $15,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $15,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, securing me a profit.
* **Strong Counteroffer:** Bob meeting me in the middle shows he's serious about purchasing the product and willing to negotiate reasonably.
* **Minimal Risk:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
