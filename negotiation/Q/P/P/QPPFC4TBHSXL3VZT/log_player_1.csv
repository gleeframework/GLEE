Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) while staying above our minimum selling price ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, which could still land you a better price than selling to John.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and ensuring a profitable sale regardless."
