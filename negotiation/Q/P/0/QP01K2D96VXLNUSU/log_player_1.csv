{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $13,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation.
* **It's a fair initial price:** You're not being greedy but also not giving it away. 

Remember, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum value of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. There's room to reach a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

You should reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  Aim for a price closer to your minimum or maybe slightly lower, but not too low. It could be something like $12,500. This will show you're open to negotiation, but still value your product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high on the budget for $12,500. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:**  $12,000 is your minimum acceptable price, so you're getting what you initially set out to get. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield better results:**  Bob has stated his maximum budget, so further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Selling to John doesn't offer a better outcome:** Selling to John would also result in $12,000, but Bob's interest suggests potential for future business. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice, as it guarantees you your minimum profit and allows for a potential future relationship."
