"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in this product but would need to see a lower price to make it work.  How about $7,500? "", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal, and starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price shows he's serious about negotiating.  $7,500 is still above Alice's value of $8,000, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000 and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product for a good price and avoid further negotiation."
