"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.**  You're aiming for a price below $10,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  This gives you a safety net if the negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for some negotiation. 
* **Clearly states your value:** You've communicated your maximum price point, showing Alice your budget constraint.
* **Open to negotiation:** You've phrased it as a fair price and requested Alice's thoughts, keeping the door open for a back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** While she's moved closer, $11,000 is still more than your $10,000 limit. 
* **There's still potential to negotiate further.** You have 7 rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  
* **Buying from John is a viable alternative.** If negotiations with Alice stall, you have a backup option. 

By rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering again, you keep the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a good middle ground and reflects the value I place on the product. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to your target:** This offer is closer to your $10,000 limit but still leaves some room for compromise.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** You're framing your offer as a good middle ground that benefits both parties.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Alice to continue negotiating towards a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer is still above your budget.**  You're determined to stay within your $10,000 limit.
* **Negotiation is at a standstill.**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and further counter-offers may not be fruitful.
* **Buying from John guarantees a good deal.** You've reached a point where it's more beneficial to secure the product from John at your desired price than to risk further negotiation with Alice. 

While there's a chance you could negotiate Alice down further, the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing time is too high. Buying from John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
