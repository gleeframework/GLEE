"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a good middle ground and reflects the value I place on the product. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
