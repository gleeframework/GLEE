"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John if necessary.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting her initial offer, you create an opportunity for negotiation."
