"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $165? I'm willing to compromise and give you a great deal.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $155. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take it.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about we meet at $160? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",160.0,Alice,5,
