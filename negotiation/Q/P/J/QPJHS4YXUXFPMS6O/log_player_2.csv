"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. You can use the negotiation to try and get a lower price. There's a chance Alice may be willing to negotiate, and you have 10 rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $1000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm not willing to accept her initial price. Hopefully, this will encourage her to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her initial offer and above my maximum budget. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, so I have time to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $7500. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise but still want a price lower than Alice's latest offer. It's a middle ground that hopefully encourages Alice to come closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $8,000.  With only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to secure the product from John at my maximum price than risk further negotiations with Alice that might not lead to a successful outcome."
