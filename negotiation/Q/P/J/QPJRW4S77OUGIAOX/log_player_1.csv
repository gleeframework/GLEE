Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering $9,000, which is slightly above the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,500 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my value.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This still gives you a great deal, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $6000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $6,000 is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get a fair price, I'll sell the product to John for $8,000."
