Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

We're still significantly above Bob's valuation and have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can nudge him closer to our desired price."

We're getting closer, but we're still above Bob's $1,000,000 valuation. Let's hold firm for one more round and see if we can push a little further."

It's time to accept. Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and while we could continue negotiating, we're already well above his $1,000,000 valuation. Accepting his offer secures us a significant profit."
