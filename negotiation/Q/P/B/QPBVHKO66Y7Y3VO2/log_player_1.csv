"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  $20,000 is a significant mark-up from my minimum value, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate.  I'll keep an eye on the rounds and if it seems like Bob is not serious, I'll cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $17,000 is still a good price, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $19,000. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round.  The rounds are getting shorter, and I'm running out of time.  If this next round doesn't work out, I might have to settle for selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $18,000. This is getting close to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll probably have to sell to John in the next round to avoid losing out on any profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale.  $16,000 is a decent profit and it's better than selling to John for $15,000."
