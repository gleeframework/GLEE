Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's well worth $100. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $100 offers a significant markup ($20) while still being in a potentially acceptable range for Bob if the product is perceived as valuable. 
* **First Offer Psychology:** Offering a slightly higher price initially leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also establishes the product's potential value in his mind."
