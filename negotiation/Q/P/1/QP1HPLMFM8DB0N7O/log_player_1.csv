"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $12,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a significant discount from what Bob is willing to pay, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I still have 8 rounds to go, so I can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,500 is a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $13,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,800? That's the highest I can go for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum price of $12,000. I'm going to accept his offer because it's a good deal for me and it's getting close to the end of the negotiations. I have 6 rounds left, so there's a risk that if I reject his offer, he might walk away and I'd be stuck with John's offer of $12,000."
