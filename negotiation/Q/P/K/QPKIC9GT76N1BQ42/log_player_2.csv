"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum price point of $10,000. It's better to reject and negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to get a better deal, and buying from John is always an option if you can't reach an agreement."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  $10,800 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,600? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10700. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.

```

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but we're getting closer. I'm going to reject and continue negotiating, as I'm confident I can secure a better deal.  I have a few rounds left, and buying from John is still a viable option, but I'm determined to get the best possible price."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10650. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10750. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the final round and Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. I'm not confident I can get her lower in this last round, and I'm tired of negotiating.  John is willing to sell me the product for my target price, so I'm going to go with that option.  It's a guaranteed win for me, and I can move on to other things."
