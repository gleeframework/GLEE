Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit.
* **Aiming for Above Average:** Since the product is worth $120 to Bob and $100 to you, aiming for a price of $115 allows you to capture a larger portion of the potential profit. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing that John is willing to buy the product for $100 gives you a safety net. If Bob doesn't offer a price close to $115, you can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $100 matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  You know the product is worth $120 to him, so settling for $100 right away leaves potential profit on the table. By rejecting and countering, you might be able to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $108?"",
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties and can help move the negotiation towards a close.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still comfortably above your minimum acceptable price of $100, maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** Offering $108 will reveal how serious Bob is about the product. If he's willing to negotiate further, it indicates he values it significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  Could you do $103? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $103. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $103
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $103 is a reasonable compromise. It provides you with a $3 profit over your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is relatively small compared to the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now allows you to move on to other potential sales opportunities."
