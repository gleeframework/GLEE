"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can sell it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you!",11500.0,Alice,5,
