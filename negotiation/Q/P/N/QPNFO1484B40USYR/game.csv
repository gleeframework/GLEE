"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to negotiate, but I'm only able to offer $700,000 at this time.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,000,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your original asking price and the fact that I can buy it elsewhere for $800,000.  ",850000.0,Bob,4,
