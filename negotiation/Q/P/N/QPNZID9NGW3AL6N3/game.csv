"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my own financial constraints. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is my absolute limit. This price is fair given the product's value and my need to stay within budget. I hope you'll consider it.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $815000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",815000.0,Alice,5,
