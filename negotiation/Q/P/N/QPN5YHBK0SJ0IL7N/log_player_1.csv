Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000 for your product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation of $1,000,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John at this point would secure my minimum price, but there's potential for a higher profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,600,000. This gives you a substantial discount from my original offer and still allows me to achieve a fair price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer of $1,600,000, but unfortunately, it still exceeds my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is within the range you're considering and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk he'll reject my counteroffer, and I might be forced to sell to John for the same amount. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids any further risk."
