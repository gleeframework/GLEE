"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly lower than my maximum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with an aggressive counteroffer that is still profitable for Alice. This strategy aims to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. I acknowledge Alice's offer and show willingness to negotiate, which might encourage her to engage further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $100.  That's still a great price for you, considering the value you've mentioned. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm looking for a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By suggesting $90, I'm proposing a compromise that is still within a reasonable range for both of us. This shows Alice that I am willing to negotiate but also that I have a firm limit in mind."
