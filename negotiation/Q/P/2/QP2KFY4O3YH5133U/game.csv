"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $20,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",12000.0,Bob,4,
