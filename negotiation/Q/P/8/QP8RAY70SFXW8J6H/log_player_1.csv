``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum acceptable value, but it still leaves room for negotiation. By offering a slightly lower price than my minimum, I'm signaling that I'm open to compromise and incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I've done my research and I believe that's a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 
 
I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I've lowered my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer also reflects Bob's interest in the product and gives him an opportunity to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from our last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1200000, so I'd like to propose a price of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price. While it's still below my minimum acceptable value, I'm willing to accept it.  I'm confident that this price will allow me to profit while also ensuring a smooth transaction with Bob."
