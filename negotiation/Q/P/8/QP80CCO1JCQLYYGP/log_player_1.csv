"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, allowing for potential negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, while still leaving room for concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not desperate to sell. Bob's offer is essentially my floor, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,500. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a profit. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but not willing to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement on his previous offer and only slightly below my starting price.  Since this is the fourth round and I'm only halfway through my 10 rounds, I believe it's worth accepting to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
