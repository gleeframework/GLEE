"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,000 is closer, but I'm still a little hesitant. Would you consider $9,000? I'm ready to make a deal if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $10,200? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal if that works for you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
