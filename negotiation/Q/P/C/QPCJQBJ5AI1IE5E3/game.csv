"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle on $1,600,000? This reflects the product's worth and ensures you're getting an excellent deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my original offer and your counteroffer, so how about we settle on $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're looking for the best possible price. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,575,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant concession on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1575000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,575,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $1,525,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1525000.0,Bob,6,
