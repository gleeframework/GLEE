"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening offer that shows I value the product highly.  It gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while also hopefully pushing Bob to seriously consider the value of the product."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

While $920,000 is a good offer, I'm still hopeful we can bridge the gap a bit further.  I want to see if I can get closer to $950,000 before potentially settling."

I'm going to counter with $930,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps the price higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair middle ground and accept the offer. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing a good deal by being too stubborn."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 920000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway at $920,000. We're down to the final rounds, and I'm hoping he sees this as a fair compromise. If he rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $800,000."

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't get closer to my desired price with Bob, it's better to get $800,000 than to risk losing out entirely.  It seems like Bob is unwilling to budge any further, and I don't want to risk getting into a stalemate.  John's offer guarantees me a substantial profit, and I'm going to take it."
