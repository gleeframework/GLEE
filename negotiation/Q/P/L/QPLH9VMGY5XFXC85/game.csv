"Hello Alice, thank you for presenting this opportunity. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I would be willing to consider a price closer to  $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. I believe the value this product brings is significantly higher than what you're currently proposing. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This adjustment reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the adjustment, but there's still a significant gap between our positions.  I'm serious about finding a fair price, but $1,900,000 is simply not feasible.  To be frank, my upper limit is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider an offer in the range of $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,650,000.  This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident it represents the true value of the product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a long way from what I can justify.  At this point, I need to see a more substantial movement on price to continue this negotiation. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to be sure we've explored all options before making a final decision. You're right that there's a gap, but I want you to consider the bigger picture. This product has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and an investment of $1,500,000 is a small price to pay for the value it will bring. That's my firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,7,
