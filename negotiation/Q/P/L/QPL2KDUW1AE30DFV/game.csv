"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $12000? This price still allows me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a good value for the product you're interested in.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
