"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the product's value to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for it.  If he rejects, I'll use the next few rounds to gauge his interest and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my floor price, I don't want to give in immediately.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better price.  I want to see if Bob is truly willing to pay this price, or if he's just testing the waters."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm showing flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my perceived value.  This round will tell me how determined Bob is to make the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $850,000. While it's still not the ideal price, I'm nearing my lower limit and don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'll take the $850,000 and avoid any further negotiation."
