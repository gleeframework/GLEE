"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our exclusive product to you. This item holds significant value to me, but I understand its worth to you is $8,000. Considering this, I propose a deal where you can acquire the product for $9,500. This price reflects my desire to ensure a fair transaction while maximizing the value I receive for my asset. I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. You are better off buying the product from John for $8,000."
