{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your needs, and I'm confident you'll be extremely satisfied with it. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price like $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Exclusive opportunity:**  Highlighting exclusivity adds perceived value and might encourage Bob to accept a higher price. 
* **Confident language:**  Using confident language about the product's value reinforces the higher price point.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to maximize profit while understanding you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can negotiate down towards your minimum or accept John's offer."
