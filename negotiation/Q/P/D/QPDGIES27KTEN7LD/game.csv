"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $18,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. Considering your offer of $13,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own budget constraints. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $13,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll counteroffer at $14,500. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirement of $15,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my target range.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $14,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like. I'm willing to offer $14,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay within my target range. I'll counteroffer at $14,250. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirement. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting a little worried that we aren't going to be able to reach an agreement. $14,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to make one final offer of $14,000. If you're not willing to accept this price, I may have to move on to another seller. ",14000.0,Bob,8,
