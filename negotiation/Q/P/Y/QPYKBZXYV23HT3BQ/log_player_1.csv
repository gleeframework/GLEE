{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, giving you some room to negotiate. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, which might encourage Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, I'm not able to go that low.  How about $1,150,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below my acceptable threshold.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
