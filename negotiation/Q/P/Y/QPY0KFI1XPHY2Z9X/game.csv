"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it would let us finalize this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  This is a fair price, and it allows us to finalize the deal without any further delays. What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
