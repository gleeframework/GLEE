Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to you, the message hints at its worth by mentioning ""its value.""
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The fact that you have another buyer (John) provides you with leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob, giving you a stronger position in the negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always lower your asking price, but you can't raise it once an offer is made."
