"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the potential in this product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and my financial limitations. I'm open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $850,000 is quite a ways off from what I can accept.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product.  What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my price point. Given the product's value to me, I can offer $1,100,000.  This price reflects a substantial compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
