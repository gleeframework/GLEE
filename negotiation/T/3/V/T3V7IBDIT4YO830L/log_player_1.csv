Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides a safety net.

By offering the product at $120, I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's valuation but not so high that it's unreasonable. There's a chance Bob might accept, netting a higher profit. If he rejects it, I can always fall back on John and still get my minimum acceptable price."
