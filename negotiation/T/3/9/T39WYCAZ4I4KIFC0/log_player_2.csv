"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $150. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $140 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my price limit."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. How about $135? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within your budget and a good compromise.  It's better than buying from John for $150. There's a chance you might be able to negotiate down further, but the risk of Alice rejecting and you having to buy from John for more is not worth it."
