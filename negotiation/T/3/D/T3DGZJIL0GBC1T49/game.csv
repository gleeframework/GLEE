"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling me the product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This would give you a significant profit, and still leave room for me to make a good return on my investment.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,087,500.  This would still be a very profitable deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably afford.",1087500.0,Bob,4,
