Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling me the product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This would give you a significant profit, and still leave room for me to make a good return on my investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
