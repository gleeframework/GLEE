"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close! I can see that you're willing to meet me at $115, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I can offer it to you for $122. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but unlikely to go much lower than $122. Accepting saves you $28 compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
