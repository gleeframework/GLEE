"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close! I can see that you're willing to meet me at $115, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I can offer it to you for $122. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a great deal.",122.0,Alice,5,
