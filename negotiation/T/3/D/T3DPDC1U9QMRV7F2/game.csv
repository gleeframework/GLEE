"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and the fact that I have alternative options.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects what this product offers. How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still above what I can realistically afford.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,150,000. This reflects a fair compromise for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,150,000 is closer to the mark, I need to see a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm committed to reaching an agreement. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $1,200,000? This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
