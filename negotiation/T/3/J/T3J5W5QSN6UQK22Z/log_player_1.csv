Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $90. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You know Bob values the product at $100. Offering it slightly below his perceived value ($90) gives you a high chance of making the sale while still securing a significant profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer aims to secure a quick sale, starting slightly higher leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down if he wants to feel like he got a deal. 
* **John as a Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that price with Bob."
