{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John if Bob refuses.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $140 creates a strong incentive for Bob. He's getting a $40 discount from my backup offer and a $40 gain compared to his own valuation.

This offer aims to strike a balance between enticing Bob while maximizing my potential earnings."
