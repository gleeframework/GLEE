"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially achieving a higher price. I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's potential for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering with a price that's higher than Bob's initial offer but still lower than my initial asking price. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is within a reasonable range of my desired price. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price for the product, while also avoiding the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown of the deal. It's a good compromise that maximizes my earnings while still securing a sale within the allocated rounds."
