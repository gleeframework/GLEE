Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm willing to let you have it for $12,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as much profit as possible, and since Bob is willing to pay a decent amount, there's room to negotiate above his perceived value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, aiming to justify the higher price point.

If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always counter with a lower price, gradually approaching $10,000 before accepting John's guaranteed offer."
