"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm giving Bob some room to negotiate, as he might be willing to pay slightly more than his initial $100 valuation. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I'm aware that John is a backup buyer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:**  While $105 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still below my desired price.
* **Room for Compromise:** I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer gives me the confidence to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? That's still a great price for a quality product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous positions. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to reinforce its worth.
* **Clear Price:**  I'm making a clear counteroffer to avoid any confusion. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** While I'm offering a compromise, I'm still holding firm above my minimum price, as I have a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $107? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $107 is very close to my minimum of $120, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go slightly higher.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I can use this round to gauge how firm Bob is on his offer and potentially get a better deal in the next round.
* **Backup Plan:** I know I can sell to John for $120, so I'm not under pressure to accept a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $107 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $109? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 109} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final attempt to bridge the gap. I'm offering a middle ground to show flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, encouraging Bob to see it as a fair compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Preparing for Decision:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $120, as I've reached the limit of my acceptable negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I really like the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $108 is very close to my minimum target of $120.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Bob is threatening to walk away, which puts the deal at risk.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob won't counteroffer again, leaving me with only John as a buyer at $120.

While $108 isn't ideal, it's a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.  I'm willing to accept it to avoid risking a complete loss of the deal."
