{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downward.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking for his feedback.

**Important Notes:**

* This is a strategic opening offer. The ideal outcome is to reach a price closer to $1,200,000.
* I'm prepared to go back and forth with counteroffers, but I'll be mindful of John's offer ($1,200,000) as my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, let alone the $1,100,000 I initially offered.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it signals that he is still interested in the product. I can use this opportunity to counter-offer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I'm aware of John's offer, which provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm emphasizing that $1,050,000 is a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Meet in the Middle:**  Using the phrase ""meet in the middle"" subconsciously positions this price as a good compromise for both of us.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* This counter-offer is still above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but well below my desired price of $1,200,000.
* I'm keeping John's offer in mind, ensuring I don't accept a price below my absolute minimum.
* This move will determine Bob's willingness to compromise further and whether we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I hope we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $950,000 is still below my absolute minimum price of $1,200,000. While it's closer to my ideal, it's not a price I can accept. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob has shown he's willing to increase his offer, and the negotiation is still progressing. There's room to work towards a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John's Offer as Assurance:**  I have John's offer as a backup, so I'm not under pressure to accept anything below my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly higher than $950,000, continuing to work towards a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering both our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm presenting this offer as a ""halfway"" point between our previous offers, reinforcing the idea of compromise.
* **Fair Price:**  I'm emphasizing that $1,000,000 is a fair price for both of us. This acknowledges Bob's budget limitations while still being a reasonable price for me.
* **Direct Question:** I'm asking a direct question (""What do you say?"") to encourage a response and move the negotiation forward.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* This offer is now at Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. If he accepts, it's a win for me, as it's above my initial price point. 
* If he rejects, I still have John's offer as a backup, so I can confidently walk away if necessary. 
* I'm aiming for a swift conclusion to the negotiation, as continued back-and-forth could risk losing both buyers."
