"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a positive interaction. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** I'm not setting a hard limit right away, which allows Bob to counter without feeling like he's hitting a wall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $85 is less than my minimum price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While Bob is offering lower than my initial offer, it's a starting point for further negotiation. 
* **I have time:** I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a better price. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""walk away happy"" to emphasize the benefits of accepting the offer.
* **Still above minimum:** The price is still above my minimum of $120, but leaves room for further negotiation. 

By proposing $92.50, I'm trying to find a middle ground and push Bob towards a price closer to my target without pushing him away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can go as high as $92.50. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation room:** While Bob is getting closer, there's still some room to negotiate upwards.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 rounds remaining and haven't yet reached my minimum.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your offer.  But $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $91, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying, let's close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 91}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing closer to my target:**  I'm raising the price slightly, showing that I'm not budging significantly but still open to negotiation. 
* **Final offer strategy:**  Stating it's my ""final offer"" adds pressure and encourages Bob to consider the deal seriously.
* **Motivating action:**  I'm urging Bob to make a decision to move the negotiation forward.

By slightly increasing the price and emphasizing finality, I'm hoping to push Bob towards accepting the offer in this round or at least offer a counter that's closer to my target."
