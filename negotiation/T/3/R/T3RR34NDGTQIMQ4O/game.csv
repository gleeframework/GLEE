"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure I can go as high as $92.50. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's the best I can do.,90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your offer.  But $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $91, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying, let's close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",91.0,Alice,5,
