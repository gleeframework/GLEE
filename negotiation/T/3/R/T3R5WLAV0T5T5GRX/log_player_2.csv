"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. While I'm unable to disclose the exact nature of the product at this time, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1200000 to me. I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us, but my starting point is $1500000. This allows for a mutually beneficial transaction and recognizes the inherent value of this product. Please let me know your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, but it's worth no less than $1,200,000 to her, I think she's trying to make a profit. Given that I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll reject her offer and buy the product from John for $800,000.
