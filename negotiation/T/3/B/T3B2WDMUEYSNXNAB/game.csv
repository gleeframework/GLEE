"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I bring to this opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. While your initial offer is appealing, the value of this product is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This would be a win-win, allowing you to secure a sale while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's make this happen.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you clearly recognize the value here.  I'm willing to make one final concession to seal the deal quickly.  Let's settle at $1,312,500. This represents a significant discount for you and allows us both to move forward.  Does this work for you?",1312500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,312,500.  Let's bridge the gap with a final offer of $1,290,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
