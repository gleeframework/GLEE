"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I bring to this opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. While your initial offer is appealing, the value of this product is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This would be a win-win, allowing you to secure a sale while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and sees the value.  While $1,275,000 is a good offer, I still have room to negotiate and try to secure a higher price.  I'm willing to take a calculated risk for one more round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly recognize the value here.  I'm willing to make one final concession to seal the deal quickly.  Let's settle at $1,312,500. This represents a significant discount for you and allows us both to move forward.  Does this work for you?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,312,500.  Let's bridge the gap with a final offer of $1,290,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but the increments are getting smaller. This suggests he's nearing his maximum price.  While I could hold out for more, accepting $1,290,000 guarantees a strong profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
