{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95.  I believe it's worth even more, but I'm hoping for a quick and easy sale."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value:** While you have a guaranteed $80 from John, a quicker sale to Bob at a higher price might be more desirable. 

This offer aims to balance getting the best price from Bob while acknowledging you have other options."
