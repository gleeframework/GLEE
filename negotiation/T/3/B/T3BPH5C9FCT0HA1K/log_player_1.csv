Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price. $1,200,000 is still a good amount, but I believe the product is worth more. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if needed."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price.  Given the product's unique capabilities, I'm confident it can deliver significant value for you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for now. If things don't work out, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1275000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,275,000 is still a good deal, and I'm not sure I can get much more from Bob.  It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, but I'd rather secure a higher price now."
