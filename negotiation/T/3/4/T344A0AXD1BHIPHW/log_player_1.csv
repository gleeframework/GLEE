"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and makes the offer feel more appealing. 
* **Strategic Use of Rounds:**  I want to explore Bob's willingness to pay before resorting to John's guaranteed deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I think we can find a better solution for both of us. I am willing to pay $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 would be the most profitable option right now, but I want to see if I can push Bob higher and gain even more.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 8 rounds left to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That way, we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price above Bob's initial offer.
* **Midpoint Approach:**  The offer is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, creating a sense of fairness.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I want to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original proposal. I am still willing to pay $950,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is insistent on his $950,000 offer, and I'm not willing to drop further from my target. We've reached a stalemate.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're already in round 4, and continuing to negotiate with Bob risks running out of rounds without a significant improvement in price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees a profit that's considerably higher than what I can realistically get from Bob at this point.  

It's better to secure a guaranteed deal with John than to risk losing out on a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
