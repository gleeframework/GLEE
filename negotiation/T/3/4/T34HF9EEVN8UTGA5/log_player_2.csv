# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is lower than what Bob would pay John ($1,200,000). Therefore, it is in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer to save $50,000."
