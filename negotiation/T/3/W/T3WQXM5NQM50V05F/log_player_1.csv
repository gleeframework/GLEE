"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's seriousness.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""immense value and potential,"" the message aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a high level.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While the offer is high, it's essential to stay well above John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. This ensures you have leverage and options throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is way too high for me. Given my maximum budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm eager to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than both your minimum and John's standing offer. You have room to negotiate and try to bring Bob closer to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe this product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the true value and potential this product offers you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above John:** The counteroffer represents a substantial decrease from your initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, it remains comfortably above John's $1,500,000 offer, preserving your leverage.
* **Reiterating Value:** By restating the product's value, you aim to steer Bob away from anchoring solely on his initial assessment of $1,000,000.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise, fostering a collaborative atmosphere in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I understand your perspective,  $2,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's standing offer of $1,500,000. While you might have been able to negotiate a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away if you push further. Accepting this offer guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
