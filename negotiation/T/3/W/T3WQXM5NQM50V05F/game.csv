"Alice,  $2,300,000 is way too high for me. Given my maximum budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm eager to move forward with the purchase.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe this product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the true value and potential this product offers you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I understand your perspective,  $2,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
