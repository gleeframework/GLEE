Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're getting close to walking away, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make another concession. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.

Alice has come down considerably and is now below John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and waiting any longer risks losing the deal."
