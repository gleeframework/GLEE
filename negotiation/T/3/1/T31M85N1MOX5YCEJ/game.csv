"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're getting close to walking away, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make another concession. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,000.
