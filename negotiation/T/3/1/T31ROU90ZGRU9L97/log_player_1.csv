Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:** My ideal price is $15,000, but I need to be realistic.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so I can't ask for too much.
* **Negotiation space:** $14,000 leaves room for negotiation. I can potentially increase the price if Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer:** I have a backup offer of $15,000 from John, so I can walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome.

This offer gives Bob a good deal, but also leaves room for me to earn a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also below Bob's own stated valuation of $12,000, making it an unrealistic expectation.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, I can still try to negotiate a better deal. He has shown a willingness to compromise, and I can use that to my advantage.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. If that fails, I can still sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still gives you a great value, and it's more fair for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $14,000 to $12,500.
* **Middle ground:**  $12,500 represents a good middle ground between my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($11,000).
* **Appeal to value:** I'm highlighting the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing that he's still getting a good deal at $12,500. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as fair for both of us, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually acceptable price while still maintaining a profitable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about we try $11,750? I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $11,750 is very close to Bob's initial offer of $11,000, and it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome:** Bob has shown a strong reluctance to increase his offer. Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum acceptable value.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed win:**  Selling to John guarantees me the full $15,000, which is far more profitable than accepting Bob's latest offer.

While I would prefer to sell to Bob if the price was right, John's offer is too good to pass up. It ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiations."
