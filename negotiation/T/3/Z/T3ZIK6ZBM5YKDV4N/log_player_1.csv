Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,450,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000, Alice starts with a significantly higher offer ($1,450,000) to establish a strong negotiating position and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Sense of urgency & exclusivity:** The message implies scarcity and time sensitivity (""exclusive opportunity"", ""one-time offer"", ""other interested buyers"") to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the high price. 
* **Backup plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000 if Bob rejects the offer, providing a safety net and allowing her to confidently aim high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit. However, a very high offer might make Bob completely disinterested in negotiating.  It's a calculated risk Alice takes, banking on Bob's potential strong desire for the product."
