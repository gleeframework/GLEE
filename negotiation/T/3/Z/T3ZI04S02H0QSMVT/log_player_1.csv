Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $925,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and offers a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You are aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Your goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing you well above your minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below $800,000.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, giving you the best chance to maximize your profit."
