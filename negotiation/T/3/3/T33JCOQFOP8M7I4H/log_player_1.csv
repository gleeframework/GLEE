{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $11,500 is above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** By not going straight for the $12,000, you give Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  $11,500 is about halfway between your minimum and Bob's estimated value, giving him room to counteroffer while still leaving you a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $10,500 is above your minimum and guarantees a sale, you have a better chance of getting closer to your desired price by rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate.  You can use this opportunity to try and meet halfway with Bob's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's meet in the middle - how about $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice. 

Here's why:

* **Close to your goal:**  $10,750 is very close to your desired price of $11,000, and it's only $250 less.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Accepting this offer guarantees you a sale, which is always better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though you're not getting your top price, accepting a reasonable counteroffer can build trust with Bob, potentially opening the door for future deals."
