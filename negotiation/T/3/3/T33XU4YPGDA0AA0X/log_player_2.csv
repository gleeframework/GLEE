"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1500000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can negotiate a lower price. You have a significant buffer between your valuation and Alice's offer, so there's room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  Given your value for the product and my own assessment, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being reasonable for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good deal for you. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and it's still within your budget. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or having Alice walk away is too high.  Accepting this offer secures a good price and ensures you get the product."
