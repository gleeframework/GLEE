"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  Given your value for the product and my own assessment, I'm willing to offer $750000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being reasonable for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
