Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person.  I'm starting with an offer of $15,000, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, but it is still less than the minimum value I set for the product. This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I don't undervalue my product right from the start. I'm also emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value I'm placing on this product, I'm willing to pay $12000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value for the product, but it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to meet you halfway. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still significantly more than John is offering. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really only able to spend $12000.  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase from John at that price if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's clear that we won't agree on a price.  Rather than continue negotiating with Bob, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than risking getting nothing at all from Bob."
