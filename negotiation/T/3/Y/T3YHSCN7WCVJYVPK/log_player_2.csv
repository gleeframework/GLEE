You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $90?  This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us and a good deal for you.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's risky. You might be able to get the price down a little, but it's not guaranteed. John offers a sure thing at $80, which aligns with your goal of spending no more than that."
