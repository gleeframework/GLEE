{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm hoping he'll see the value and accept, but I'm also ready to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  It's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even significantly lower than my initial offer. While I want to sell the product, I'm not going to give it away at a loss. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $90?  This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $60 is quite a jump. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a pretty good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also conscious of John's offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us and a good deal for you.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 85}
