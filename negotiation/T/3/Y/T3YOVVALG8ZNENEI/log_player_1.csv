"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and creates the perception of value. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,300,000, we ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher number, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffer to be more favorable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer acknowledges Bob's potential interest while providing ample space for negotiation over the 10 rounds.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while remaining aware of the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. Rejecting this low offer signals that you're serious about the product's worth and encourages a more reasonable counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Apparent Concessions):** While $1,000,000 is our minimum acceptable price, framing it as ""meeting in the middle"" makes it seem like a concession from our initial offer. This can encourage Bob to feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Establishing a Firm Baseline:**  This counteroffer clearly communicates that $1,000,000 is our bottom line. We're not budging below this point, and Bob needs to understand this.
* **Maintaining Optionality:** We haven't accepted John's offer yet, keeping our options open in case Bob comes significantly closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a firm budget. How about we try $700,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while respecting the limitations of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below our $1,000,000 threshold and John's standing offer. We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if necessary, prompting Bob to potentially make a more serious offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I've got another buyer interested at a significantly higher price.  If you're serious, I need to see an offer of at least $900,000. Otherwise, I'll have to pursue the other offer."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. This might push Bob to make a more aggressive offer.
* **Slightly Lowering the Price:** Dropping to $900,000 shows some flexibility while still staying above John's offer. This signals that we're willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Setting a Deadline (Implied):**  By saying ""otherwise, I'll have to pursue the other offer,"" we imply that time is running out for Bob to make a deal. This adds pressure without issuing a hard ultimatum."
