"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a firm budget. How about we try $700,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while respecting the limitations of my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I've got another buyer interested at a significantly higher price.  If you're serious, I need to see an offer of at least $900,000. Otherwise, I'll have to pursue the other offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
