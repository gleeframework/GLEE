Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I've got another buyer interested at a significantly higher price.  If you're serious, I need to see an offer of at least $900,000. Otherwise, I'll have to pursue the other offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency, it's clear she's willing to negotiate down from her initial price. However, her latest offer of $900,000 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. At this point, it's in your best interest to secure the product at the best price available to you, which is from John at $800,000."
