{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm framing the offer by highlighting the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider it. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and John's offer before deciding on my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9,500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a better offer than before, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price by countering Bob's offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Selling to John is always an option if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still below my minimum price.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards my target:**  My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's but still below my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the product's value. 
* **Fair compromise:**  By proposing a middle ground, I'm aiming to make the deal seem mutually beneficial.
* **Maintaining pressure:** By not accepting Bob's offer outright, I keep the pressure on Bob to meet my expectations.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose $10,500 as a final offer for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's getting closer, it's not a price I'm comfortable accepting.
* **Potential for better outcome:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is the backup plan:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the remaining gap. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll likely sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than I can accept.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product to you.  Let me know if you're interested, or we can both move on."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my last attempt to get closer to my target price, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Pressure to close:** By stating it's my final offer, I'm putting the pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Fair compromise:**  The offer is still a compromise, but it's closer to my desired price.
* **Prepared to walk away:**  I'm ready to sell to John if Bob rejects my offer, so I'm not desperate for a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I will sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your last offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget. However, I am unable to accept $11,000 for the product. My final offer remains at $10,500. I hope this is acceptable for you, or I will consider purchasing the product from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further negotiation:** Bob has made it clear that he will not go higher than $10,500.
* **John's offer is significantly better:** John is willing to pay $15,000, which is significantly more than Bob's final offer.
* **Time to move on:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result, and I don't want to risk losing out on John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will inform Bob that I am not willing to accept his final offer and will be selling the product to John."
