"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9,500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still below my minimum price.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you.  Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than I can accept.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product to you.  Let me know if you're interested, or we can both move on.",11000.0,Alice,5,
