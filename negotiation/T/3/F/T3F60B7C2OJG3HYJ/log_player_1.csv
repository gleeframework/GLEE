Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for him to counteroffer and for you to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **It shows you're serious:** By offering a price above your minimum, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum:**  $130 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiating further is unlikely to yield a significantly better result:** While you could try to get closer to your desired $140, the risk is that Bob will walk away or you'll get stuck in a protracted negotiation.  $130 is a reasonable compromise and secures a sale. 
* **Selling to John is less profitable:**  You would earn $10 less by selling to John. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision to maximize your earnings."
