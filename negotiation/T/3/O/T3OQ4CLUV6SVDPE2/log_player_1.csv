Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better price than $100, as the product is worth at least that to me. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. Would you be interested in that?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating, Bob's offer of $112.50 is getting closer to my minimum price of $100.  It's a good deal for both of us."
