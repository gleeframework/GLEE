"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider reducing the price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $80 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hoping to keep it under $80. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $90 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $100 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. I really appreciate it. I would like to propose $95 as my final offer. I hope this works for you.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $98 as my final offer. This is a great deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. If you're not interested, I'm going to have to start considering other options.",98.0,Alice,7,
