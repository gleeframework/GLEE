"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers substantial benefits that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This revised offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for this product.  This offer is based on its value to me and represents a significant investment. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your increased offer demonstrates serious interest, and I'm motivated to reach a deal. However, the product's value remains much higher than your current proposal. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,300,000.  This reflects a significant investment on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
