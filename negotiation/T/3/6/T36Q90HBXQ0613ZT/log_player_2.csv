# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers substantial benefits that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This revised offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a reduction from the first offer, it's still well above my limit. I'll counter with a price closer to my maximum."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your increased offer demonstrates serious interest, and I'm motivated to reach a deal. However, the product's value remains much higher than your current proposal. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you see in the product.
