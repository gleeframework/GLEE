Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers substantial benefits that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This revised offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for this product.  This offer is based on its value to me and represents a significant investment. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is showing a willingness to move significantly higher in his offer (from $800,000 to $1,100,000). While still below my minimum, it indicates potential for negotiation.  I'll counter-offer in the hopes of reaching a more favorable price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your increased offer demonstrates serious interest, and I'm motivated to reach a deal. However, the product's value remains much higher than your current proposal. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you see in the product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,300,000.  This reflects a significant investment on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly closed the gap, and at $1,300,000, the offer is now above my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for more in further rounds, there's a risk of Bob reducing his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a strong profit."
