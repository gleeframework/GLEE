"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to get a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This leaves us both with a solid profit margin. Let me know if you're interested.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to profit from this transaction. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to agree on a price. Let's try one last time before I have to consider other options.  How about $1,065,000?  It's a small compromise from my side, and it's still a good deal for you. This is my final offer.",1065000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer. While it's getting closer, $1,065,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,060,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
