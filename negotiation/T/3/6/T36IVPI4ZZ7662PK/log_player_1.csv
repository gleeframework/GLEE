Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $1,150,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and still leaves some room for negotiation while being significantly closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can do better. I'll counteroffer one last time before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1120000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob with $1,120,000. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but still higher than his current offer.  If he rejects, I'll likely go with John's offer to secure a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I'd prefer to get more, I don't want to risk further negotiations and lose a sale entirely. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $800,000, which is still significantly higher than my minimum."
