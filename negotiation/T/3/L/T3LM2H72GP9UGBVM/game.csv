"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $15000 for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $15000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $8000 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $12000? This would still give you a great deal, and I'd be happy to sell it to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm firm at my offer of $8000. If you're willing to consider that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,4,
