Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I value your interest.  While $18,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit shy of the price you're quoting. Would you be willing to consider $17,500?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $18,250? This reflects my desire to make a deal while recognizing the value you see in the product."", ""product_price"": 18250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $17,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently coming down in increments, showing he's willing to negotiate. However, he's still a significant amount above his true valuation. We're getting close to my fallback option with John, but I believe I can push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $17,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with.  My final offer is $17,750.  This represents a significant discount on my initial asking price, and I believe it's more than fair."", ""product_price"": 17750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last discussion, so I'm offering $16,500. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:** Bob is now significantly below his actual valuation and seems to be employing a strategy of lowballing. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of him walking away is increasing, and I'd be left with a lower offer than John's guaranteed $15,000. It's time to take the safe and profitable option with John."
