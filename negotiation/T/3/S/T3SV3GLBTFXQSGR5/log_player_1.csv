Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to start high. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, I'm going to ask for that price. This way, I can immediately secure my minimum value. If Bob rejects, I can then start negotiating with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my own valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a reasonable compromise, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a more reasonable offer and is willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can do better.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get closer to my desired price. I think this could be a good compromise point, and I hope Bob will see it as such."
