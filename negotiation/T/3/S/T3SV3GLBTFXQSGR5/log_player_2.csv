It's always better to try and negotiate.  You can get a better price than $1,000,000 from John, and since Alice values the product at $1,500,000, there's room for a deal."

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now only $150,000 higher than what you can get from John. Accepting her offer would mean getting the product for a reasonable price while avoiding further negotiation."
