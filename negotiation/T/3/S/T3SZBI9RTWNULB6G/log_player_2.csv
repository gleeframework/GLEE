"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product, Bob. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Even though you'd save $500 buying from John, Alice's offer is still within your budget of $12,000.
* **Your goal is to save money.** You can get the product for a lower price from Alice."
