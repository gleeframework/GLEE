{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $125. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $110 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $112.50 is a good price, and it's important to close the deal before we run out of rounds.  I'm confident I can get a better price with John in the future, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
