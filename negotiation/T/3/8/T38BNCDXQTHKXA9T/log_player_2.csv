"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $125. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your target price of $150. You want to try and negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer allows you to do that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair price for both parties.  If Alice rejects, you can continue to negotiate down further in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $110 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $115 is still above your target price of $100. You're still confident you can negotiate a better deal, so you'll reject this offer and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to show your willingness to negotiate while still keeping your goal of $100 in mind. Splitting the difference is a common tactic in negotiations, and it can be a good way to find a compromise that both parties are happy with. If Alice rejects, you can continue to negotiate down in the next round."
