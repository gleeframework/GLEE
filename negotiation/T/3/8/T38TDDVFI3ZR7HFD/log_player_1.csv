Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:** While I don't explicitly state why I value the product at $20,000, the phrase ""significant value"" implies there's a good reason. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.

**Important Considerations:**

* Bob's willingness to pay $15,000 doesn't mean he won't consider a higher price if he sees the value. 
* By starting at $20,000, I have room to negotiate down to a price that's still profitable for me while potentially exceeding my minimum."
