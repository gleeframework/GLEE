"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not being too aggressive with my initial offer, allowing for back-and-forth negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This is just the first round. My goal is to maximize my earnings, while also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120. I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking for a lower price. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $85 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **I have room to negotiate:**  I have 9 rounds left, and Bob is clearly interested. I believe there's potential to reach a price closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground.  I'll also continue to keep John's offer in mind, but I'm optimistic that I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm decreasing the price by $5, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a reasonable margin:** $95 is still above Bob's initial offer, and importantly, it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive language:**  I'm using encouraging language to maintain a positive tone and keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

By dropping the price slightly, I'm trying to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. If he rejects this offer, I'll know he's likely not going to come closer to my minimum price, and I may need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $90 for the product. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **We're getting closer:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and his offer is getting closer to my desired range. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming to reach a price closer to my target. I'll continue to keep in mind that I can always sell to John, but I believe there's still room to close a deal with Bob at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $92? That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates a commitment to finding a solution.
* **Maintaining my margin:**  $92 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Positive language:**  I'm using encouraging language to emphasize the mutual benefit of the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to sway Bob.  If he still rejects it, I'll have to consider whether to continue negotiating or sell to John.  However, I'm confident that $92 is a fair price and that Bob might be willing to close the deal at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $91 for the product. Let me know if this is feasible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $91 is still below my ideal price, it's only $1 away from my minimum acceptable price of $90. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly higher offer from Bob.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Selling to John guarantees $120, but there's a chance that I could get a better offer in the next round or two.  Accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and secures a decent profit.

**Strategy:**

It's a calculated risk.  Accepting Bob's offer means settling for a lower price than I initially hoped for, but it guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob in the remaining rounds.  Since we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price and the number of rounds is limited, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action."
