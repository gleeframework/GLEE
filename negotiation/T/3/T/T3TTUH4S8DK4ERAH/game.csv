"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This allows you a decent profit while still being a great price for me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking to get a higher price for the product. I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $1050000. This still gives you a significant discount on your estimated value and allows me to make a good profit. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want a higher price, but $1050000 is still too high for me.  Let's compromise. I'll offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you a good profit while still being a great deal for me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
