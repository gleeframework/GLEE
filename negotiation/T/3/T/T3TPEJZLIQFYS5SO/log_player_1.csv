Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Bob's offer is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's not ideal, but it's a quick and certain deal. It's better than risking further negotiations and potentially ending up with a lower offer or needing to sell to John."
