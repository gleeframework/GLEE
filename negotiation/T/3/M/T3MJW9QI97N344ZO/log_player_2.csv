"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  We acknowledge Alice's offer and maintain a positive tone.
* **Signals a significant gap:** By starting with $60, we're anchoring the negotiation much lower than Alice's initial offer.  This leaves room for negotiation but makes it clear we're looking for a substantial discount.
* **Leaves the door open:**  We express interest (""Would you consider...?"") rather than issuing an ultimatum. This keeps the negotiation open.

Our goal is to see if Alice is flexible. If she's willing to come down significantly, we might be able to get a deal much better than John's $80 offer.  However, we're prepared to walk away if she's not budging."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $130. I believe this product offers excellent value, even at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved a bit from her initial offer, $130 is still significantly higher than both our desired price and John's offer. We need to signal that we're serious about a much lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice, but $130 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, around $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Acknowledging but firm:** We acknowledge Alice's willingness to move but stand our ground on the price being too high.
* **Middle ground approach:** Suggesting $75 positions our offer as a compromise, even though it's closer to our initial offer. This can encourage Alice to negotiate further.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will help us gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's unwilling to come down to this range, it might be time to consider John's offer seriously."
