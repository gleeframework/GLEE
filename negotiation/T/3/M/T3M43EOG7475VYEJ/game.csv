"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to me. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $97.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $101.25?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $101.25. I'm willing to go up to $98. Can you consider that?,98.0,Bob,6,
