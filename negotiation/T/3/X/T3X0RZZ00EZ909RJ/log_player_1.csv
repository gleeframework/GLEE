Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I need at least $800,000 for the product.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm offering a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  This should increase the chance of him accepting the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. The best approach depends on your risk tolerance and how much you believe Bob is willing to pay."
