"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to both of us, and I believe it can significantly benefit your needs. I am offering it to you for $110, which is a special introductory price. Please let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good starting point, but it's still above your target price.  Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a chance you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Therefore, I propose an offer of $105 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows you to acquire the product at a reasonable price while still providing a good margin for me. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's still below my target of $100, but it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Accepting this offer saves me money compared to buying from John and is a positive outcome for both parties."
