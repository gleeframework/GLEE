"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a special price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might make her propose a lower price, getting you closer to the $120 she values it at. If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $150."
