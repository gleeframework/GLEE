"Alice, your product looks great, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $10,500 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $10,750 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more to reflect the product's worth. How about we settle at $10,900? I believe that's a fair compromise.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,900 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,800. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10800.0,Bob,6,
