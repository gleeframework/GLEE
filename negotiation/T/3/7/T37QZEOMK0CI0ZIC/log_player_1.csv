``` 

This offer starts with a price that's significantly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation and maximizing my potential earnings. I'm confident Bob will find the offer attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,350,000 is a decent offer, I can likely get a better price. I'm still confident I can negotiate a higher offer from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,375,000. Can you consider this price?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,380,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,365,000. Can you consider this price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly closer to my minimum. While I could counteroffer again, there's no guarantee he'll accept.  I've already compromised significantly and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
