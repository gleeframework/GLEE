Alice's offer:

While $125 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum price, but still a bit lower than my original offer. What do you think?

While $115 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's time to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
