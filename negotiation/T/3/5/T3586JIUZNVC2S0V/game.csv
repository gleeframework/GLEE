"I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, though, and would be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to purchase the product without going over budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum price, but still a bit lower than my original offer. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
