Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is very low and leaves no room for negotiation upwards. It's likely he's trying to anchor the price low.  I should counter, but I'm also aware of the opportunity cost of continuing to negotiate.

Round 3
