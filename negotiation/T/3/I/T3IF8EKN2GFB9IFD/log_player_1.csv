"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This price is above Bob's perceived value but within a range where I believe he might consider it, especially since he has a strong interest in the product. I'm leaving room for negotiation and want to see if Bob is willing to come closer to my desired range."

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm willing to negotiate further, and I believe that by making a counteroffer, I can push the price closer to my ideal range."

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my target range."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if Bob is willing to come up to my desired price."

Round 5

```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,550,000. This demonstrates a continued willingness to negotiate and shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal.  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's still room for Bob to come up a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum. I'm not confident I can get him to move much higher. Selling to John guarantees me a profit that meets my minimum, and it's worth it to avoid further negotiation with Bob."
