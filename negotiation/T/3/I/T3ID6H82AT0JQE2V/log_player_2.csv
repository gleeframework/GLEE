"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good deal, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($1,000,000).  There's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still above the product's worth to her.  It shows you're serious about buying but are willing to negotiate.  This gives Alice a chance to consider a deal that's still profitable for her while saving you a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, her offer is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her.  Since we're only in Round 3, there's still time to push for a better price, especially considering we can always purchase from John for $1,500,000 as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than our previous offer, showing willingness to meet Alice halfway. It's still significantly lower than her last offer and leaves room for further negotiation while still remaining within our budget."
