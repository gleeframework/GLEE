"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives us room to negotiate, but still leaves a significant profit margin for me.  I'm hoping he'll accept this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent profit, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but not significantly.  $1,350,000 is still a good price for me, and hopefully, it's tempting enough for Bob to accept.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm confident we can close this within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is a solid profit. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and risk of a deal falling through."
