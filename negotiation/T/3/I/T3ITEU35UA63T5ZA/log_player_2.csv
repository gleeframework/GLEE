{""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within the realm of possibility considering the product's value to Alice.  This allows room for negotiation and hopefully gets Alice to reconsider."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is significantly lower than her initial offer and within my budget. It's a good deal compared to buying from John, and I'm likely not going to get a better price. Accepting the offer maximizes my savings while still securing the product."
