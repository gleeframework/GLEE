# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is above your maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my budget.  While it's closer to my target price, I'm still willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my goal of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to pay $12,500.  It's a fair price that's within our budgets and allows us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12,500 just yet. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my budget.  At this point, the negotiation isn't moving quickly enough towards my target price. I've already had a few rounds of back-and-forth, and I don't want to risk running out of time and missing out on the product entirely. It's safer to buy from John, who's offering the product for my desired price of $12,000."
