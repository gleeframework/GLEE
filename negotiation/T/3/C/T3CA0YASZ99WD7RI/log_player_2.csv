"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is already very close to your maximum price, and it's likely you can't get a significantly better deal by negotiating further. There's always a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer, and you'll end up paying the same amount to John. It's a small gain but worth accepting the offer to secure the product."
