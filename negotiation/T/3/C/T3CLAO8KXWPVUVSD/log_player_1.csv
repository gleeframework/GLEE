{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a strong starting point:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000)**, showing you're open to negotiation but also value the product.
* **It leaves room for negotiation.** Bob knows it's worth more to him, so he's likely to counteroffer.
* **It's a significant portion of the value to Bob ($1,500,000).** This could make him more inclined to accept.

The message is friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, but I think it's a bit high for me. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I can likely do better. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, Bob has reached his limit, and further negotiation may result in a stalemate.  Selling to Bob for $1,100,000 is still significantly better than my minimum acceptable price and selling to John."
