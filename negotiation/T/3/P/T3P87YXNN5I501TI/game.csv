"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $18000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already gone quite low on the price.
