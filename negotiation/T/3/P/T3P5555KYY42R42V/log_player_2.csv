Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a lower price."

Alice is moving in the right direction by lowering her price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to pay less, Alice is meeting me halfway repeatedly.  At this point, $1,075,000 is a significant saving compared to buying from John, and we're approaching a mutually agreeable price.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product and avoid further negotiation."
