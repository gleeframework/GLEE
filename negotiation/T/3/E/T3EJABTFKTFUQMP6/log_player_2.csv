"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $6,000 is a good starting point, but there's a lot of room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, about 33% lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals my seriousness in wanting a good deal. The goal is to get Alice to come down from her initial price and see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $5,500 is still too high. I want to see if I can get her lower, especially since I'm willing to pay $15,000 from John.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $4,500.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to move, but I'm still trying to secure a good deal. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $5,200 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my desired price point and my previous counteroffer. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price, especially since I have a backup option with John.  Rejecting allows for more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4800}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $4,800. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing a willingness to meet in the middle. With only four rounds remaining, I need to start getting closer to a potential agreement while still saving as much as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $5,000, which is only $200 more than my last offer. This is getting very close to my desired price point, and with only three rounds remaining, it's time to lock in a deal.  It's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a lower price in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer guarantees I get the product for a good price within my budget."
