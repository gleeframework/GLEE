"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), you aim to anchor the negotiation in your favor. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  The high initial price provides ample room for negotiation and potential concessions, making Bob feel like they are getting a better deal as the price comes down.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and negotiation style. 

**Important Note:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob if you negotiate strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, which isn't surprising.  You knew going in you'd likely need to negotiate. Accepting his first offer would leave significant money on the table. You have room to negotiate and still make more than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price closer to $1,800,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate but makes a substantial move down from the initial price.  It signals you are serious but keeps the deal potentially profitable.
* **Holding Above Bob's Value:** By staying above Bob's stated value, you maintain pressure and keep room for further concessions if needed. 
* **Encouraging a Counter:** The message aims to encourage a counteroffer from Bob, giving you further insight into his negotiation limits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, I still believe that $1,200,000 is a reasonable price for the product. Could we meet somewhere in between these two prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob meeting you at your minimum acceptable price is a strong signal that this is his maximum.  While there might be a slim chance of getting slightly more from him, it's a risk to continue negotiating. Accepting now secures you the best possible outcome with minimal risk of losing the deal."
