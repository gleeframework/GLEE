"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a good start, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $1,037,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
