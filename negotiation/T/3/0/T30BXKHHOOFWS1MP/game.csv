"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is significant, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down a bit, however. I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
