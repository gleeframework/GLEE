"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle a bit - how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
