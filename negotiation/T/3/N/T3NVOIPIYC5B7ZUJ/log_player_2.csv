"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship, but firm in my desire for a lower price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** My counteroffer is closer to Alice's value ($100) than my maximum ($120). This might make her more likely to accept, especially if she's motivated to sell quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice met me in the middle. $105 is a reasonable price, saving me $15 from John's offer and $5 from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Alice might not go any lower, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy it for $105. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now secures the product at a good price without further hassle."
