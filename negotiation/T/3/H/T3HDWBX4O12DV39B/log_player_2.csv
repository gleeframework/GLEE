Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. How about we meet at $115? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach $100. At this point, accepting John's offer ensures we get the product at the best possible price for us. It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
