Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies value by mentioning ""highly beneficial"" and the fact that you're offering it to Bob before a public listing. This can make the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room:** While aiming high, the $12,000 offer is still within a potentially acceptable range for Bob if he values the product significantly. 
 
**Important Note:** It's crucial to be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price that's acceptable to you. You already have a guaranteed sale at $10,000."
