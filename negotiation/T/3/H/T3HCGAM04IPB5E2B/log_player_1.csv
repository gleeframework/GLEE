Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $9,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Highlight Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob doesn't reject the offer, forcing me to sell it to John for a lower amount."
