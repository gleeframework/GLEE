"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1500000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left to potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,500,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, as that's the maximum value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I believe the product's value goes beyond what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. My revised offer is $1350000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it's a reduction from the initial offer, Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his maximum value.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get closer to his target price of $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,225,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced we're at the right price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $1300000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, the offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Given that Bob only has 5 rounds left, the risk of not finding a suitable price is high.  It's more prudent for Bob to buy from John at $1,200,000, guaranteeing the product at a price within his budget."
