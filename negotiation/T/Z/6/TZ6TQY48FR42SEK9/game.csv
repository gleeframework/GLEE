"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $5,000. Considering its value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $7,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $8,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
