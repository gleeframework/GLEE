Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. It's a fantastic deal for something of this value, and I know you'll be very happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible.
* **John as a Guarantee:**  Knowing John will buy it for $15,000 provides a safety net, meaning you shouldn't go below that price.
* **Enticing Bob:** Offering the product slightly below your absolute bottom line ($14,999) makes it tempting for Bob. He gets a $5,000 perceived discount, and you secure almost your full value. 

It's a win-win scenario if Bob accepts!"
