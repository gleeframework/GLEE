Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, aiming high with Bob initially allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""value"" and ""potential"" without explicitly stating what Bob's benefit is. This encourages Bob to consider the offer based on his own perceived value, which could be higher than $800,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals that the price is open to discussion, potentially leading to a price that's higher than what John offers while remaining attractive to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is open to negotiation.  If we knew Bob was very price-sensitive or disliked haggling, a different approach might be better.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If we knew Bob was considering other offers or needed a quick decision, a more aggressive (lower) price might be necessary."
