"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $92 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $98 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a decent profit.  Let's close this deal.",98.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close! I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $95 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about $97?  This is a good compromise and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen.",97.0,Alice,7,
