"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $1,000,000.  This gives me a lot of room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers, and it shows I value the product highly.  I'm confident the product is worth more to him than $800,000, so I'm aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my target price. I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my perceived value of the product just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation and hopefully gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'm trying to find a balance between being firm on my desired price and not risking losing Bob completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's slightly better than John's offer, it's still too far from my ideal price.  I'm hoping that I can push Bob a little higher with a counteroffer.  I'm also considering that we are nearing the middle of the negotiations, and if I don't start seeing better offers, selling to John may be the most sensible option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product.  I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob before we run out of rounds and I'm forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although we are getting close to the end of our negotiations, I'm not willing to sell the product for a price that is significantly less than my perceived value. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or even John if I play it right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise given that we only have a few rounds left. I'm aiming for a deal that's closer to my desired price but also keeps the possibility of a sale with Bob alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, as Bob's offer is only $15,000 less than John's. However, with only two rounds left, there's not much room for negotiation. I'm not confident that I can get Bob to come up to my price, and I don't want to risk losing both Bob and John. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $800,000."
