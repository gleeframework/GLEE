"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product for your business.  To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the potential it holds for you. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal for this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This price is still well within the value you'll gain from this product, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
