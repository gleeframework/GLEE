"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable piece with a lot of potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Confidence & Value:**  My message emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language that implies flexibility (""What do you think?"") to avoid a quick rejection. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. I'm also keeping John's offer of $800,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of your product. However, I would like to propose a lower price of $950000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate. I believe I can still secure a better price through further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting his offer now would mean potentially leaving money on the table. It's important to maintain my bargaining power and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Understanding Risk:**  Rejecting his offer does carry the risk of losing the deal completely. However, the potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk at this point. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll carefully consider Bob's offer and formulate a counteroffer that is both appealing and strategically advantageous. I'll aim for a price that is closer to my desired amount while still being competitive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer. While I value your interest, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Fairness:** My counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise by meeting halfway between our previous offers.  It creates the impression of a fair and reasonable deal. 
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I subtly reiterate the product's value to maintain its perceived importance in Bob's eyes.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The phrase ""I'm confident this price is fair for both of us"" subtly implies a sense of finality, encouraging Bob to consider closing the deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this offer. If he rejects, I'll need to evaluate whether I can afford to continue negotiating or if it's time to accept John's offer to guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's try $960000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer is now only $15,000 away from my desired price.  While I'd prefer more, it's a significant improvement from the previous round.
* **Time is Money:** We're in round 4, and each negotiation takes valuable time.  Continuing to push for a higher price risks losing Bob entirely.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While I'm not ecstatic about the price,  accepting Bob's offer provides a strong financial gain and a guaranteed sale. 

**Next Steps:**

This outcome shows that a balanced approach to negotiation is key. I successfully managed to secure a favorable price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal.  I'll learn from this experience and refine my strategies for future negotiations."
