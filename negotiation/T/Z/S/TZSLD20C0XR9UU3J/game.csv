"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price John is offering. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $87.50.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you say?",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $82.50. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",82.5,Bob,6,
