Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm happy to make some profit."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept a price that is so far below my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a significant price for you, and it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I want to see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $950,000 still doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal. Let's try to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've been considering your offers carefully, and I need to be realistic about my budget.  I can offer you $975,000. This is my final offer, as going any higher would make buying from John the more sensible option for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While Bob has come up a bit, his offer is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  John is offering a much better deal, and I'm not going to risk losing out on that."
