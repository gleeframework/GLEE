"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm happy to make some profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price in the subsequent rounds.  We have the safety net of buying from John for $1,000,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This tactic aims to leave us room for negotiation while staying under our $1,000,000 limit. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  The tone remains respectful and conveys our interest in the product while clearly stating our price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved down a bit, but we still have room for negotiation. Offering $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than our ideal price, and we know we have the option to go to John. It's worth making another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a significant price for you, and it fits within my budget."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer ($1,100,000) and our previous offer ($800,000). This tactic suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:**  We're highlighting that our offer is still beneficial to Alice while subtly reiterating our budget constraints. 
* **Urgency:** As we progress through the rounds, adding a touch of urgency (without being pushy) might encourage Alice to consider the offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $950,000 still doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal. Let's try to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our limit, but we're only $50,000 away from John's price.  We've shown a willingness to negotiate, and now it's time to hold firm and see if Alice is willing to come down further.  We still have a few rounds left to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've been considering your offers carefully, and I need to be realistic about my budget.  I can offer you $975,000. This is my final offer, as going any higher would make buying from John the more sensible option for me."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're standing our ground with a price that's a slight increase from our previous offer, signaling our willingness to compromise but also our limit.
* **Introducing John:** By mentioning John and the alternative option, we introduce a sense of urgency and a real consequence for Alice if she doesn't accept.
* **Final Offer:** Clearly stating this is our final offer lets Alice know we're serious and unlikely to budge further. This can prompt her to make a decision."
