"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room:** The offered price is significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides ample space for negotiation and potential counteroffers.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Set a high reference point for Bob.
2. **Gather Information:** Observe how Bob reacts to understand his price sensitivity. 
3. **Maintain Flexibility:** Be prepared to adjust the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still beneficial to see if you can negotiate a higher amount. You have plenty of rounds left, and John's offer provides a safety net. 

**Strategy:**

In the next round, counter with a price closer to your starting point but still lower than your initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while aiming for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize your budget constraints, the value this product brings is truly significant.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We lower our price from the initial offer, signaling we are open to negotiation.
* **Stay Strong:** The counteroffer is still significantly higher than both Bob's offer and our minimum. We're aiming high but leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** We continue to highlight the product's value to justify the high price point.  

This strategy aims to:

1.  **Test Bob's Limit:** We're gauging how serious Bob is about the purchase and how high he might be willing to go.
2.  **Maintain Control:** By making a strong counteroffer, we keep the negotiation anchored closer to our desired outcome. 
3.  **Avoid Stalemate:**  A substantial counteroffer can prevent the negotiation from stalling at a low price point too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, Alice, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and increasing his offer, but we still have room to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably less than our initial ask and our guaranteed offer from John.

**Strategy:**

Let's continue to move down incrementally but at a slower pace to signal we're reaching our limit. We'll aim for a price around $1,900,000 - $2,000,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,950,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Strong Position:** By proposing a specific price rather than asking for another counter, we're subtly suggesting this is our final offer (even if it isn't).
* **Value Justification:**  We continue to subtly reinforce the product's worth to avoid appearing desperate to close the deal quickly. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Encourage Acceptance:** Bob is likely to see this as a fair offer given the negotiation history.
2. **Maximize Profit:** We're still significantly above Bob's initial offer and our guaranteed price.
3. **Maintain Control:** We're dictating the pace and direction of the negotiation, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my financial situation, I am able to offer $1,900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** $1,900,000 is a strong price, significantly exceeding our minimum and John's offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively might alienate Bob and risk losing the sale altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and allows us to move on.

While there's a chance we could extract a slightly higher price, it's a calculated risk.  Accepting this offer ensures a substantial profit with a high degree of certainty."
