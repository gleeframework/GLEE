"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still  not quite there at $110.  Would you be willing to go down to $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $107. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",107.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference, how about $106? I'm sure we can both agree that's a fair price.",106.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $106. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $108. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,7,
