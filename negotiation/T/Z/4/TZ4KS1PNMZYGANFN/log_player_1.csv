Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and leaves room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it attractive to him.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and focuses on the value the product offers for Bob. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:**  By starting at a higher price, I give myself room to negotiate downward if necessary.
* **Be confident:**  A confident tone in my message signals that I believe in the value of my product and am not desperate to sell.
* **Focus on Bob's perspective:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob encourages him to see the offer as beneficial.

This initial offer creates a strong starting point for negotiations and sets the stage for a potentially profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not desperate to sell and believe I can secure a better deal.  I'm also confident that I can counteroffer and potentially reach a price that's closer to my desired range. 

**Strategy:**

* **Hold firm:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum.
* **Negotiate further:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  Remembering that John is willing to buy for $12,000 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and prepare to counter with a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm prepared to come down to $12,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $12,500, which is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a fair price for both parties.  I'm emphasizing the compromise I'm making.

**Strategy:**

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm open to finding a middle ground.
* **Stay close to my minimum:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose too much money.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  A positive message keeps the negotiation from becoming adversarial and increases the chances of a successful outcome. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and move us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

**Strategy:**

* **Minimize risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer eliminates the risk of further negotiation and potential deadlock. 
* **Secure a sale:** This offer guarantees a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities.
* **Focus on the outcome:**  While I may not have achieved the ideal price, I've successfully negotiated a deal that meets my minimum requirements.
