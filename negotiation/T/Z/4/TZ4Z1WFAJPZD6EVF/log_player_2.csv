"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $13,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond your initial assessment.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way too high. It's far above your maximum budget and even higher than her own valuation.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'd be willing to pay $5,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the current market and the value it holds for me."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason, even if it's a bit vague, makes the counter-offer seem more reasonable and less like a random lowball.
* **Polite and Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a good rapport with Alice is important in case further negotiation is needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $5,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $9,000 is still above both your budget and John's offer. There's room for negotiation, and settling now would mean overpaying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $6,500? I'm eager to make a deal, and I believe this offer represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  This counter-offer shows willingness to negotiate by increasing the price, but it's still significantly below Alice's last offer and within a reasonable range of your budget and John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency (Without Being Pushy):**  Phrases like ""eager to make a deal"" and ""fair compromise"" signal that you're motivated to buy but still want a good price. 
* **Focus on Agreement:**  The language emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, maintaining a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $6,500 is closer to a workable figure, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? This is my final offer, as I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now met your maximum budget of $8,000. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as they are both offering the same price.  It's a good deal, and it's time to secure the product."
