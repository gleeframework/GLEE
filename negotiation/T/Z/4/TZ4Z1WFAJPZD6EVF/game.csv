"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $13,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond your initial assessment.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'd be willing to pay $5,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the current market and the value it holds for me.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $5,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $6,500? I'm eager to make a deal, and I believe this offer represents a fair compromise.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $6,500 is closer to a workable figure, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? This is my final offer, as I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.",8000.0,Alice,5,
