"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  Given its value, I think a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's a significant difference between her cost and her asking price.  Rejecting allows Bob to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture of offering it to me first,  $14,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly find a middle ground. This shows he's serious about buying but not willing to overpay.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message emphasizes that the price is too high *for Bob*, hinting that he's aware of the product's value to Alice.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with ""Let me know what you think,"" keeping the door open for further negotiation and signaling a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  It's a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is a good compromise, putting the price closer to Bob's desired range.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice getting frustrated and sticking with her price or Bob losing the product to John exists. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids further potential complications."
