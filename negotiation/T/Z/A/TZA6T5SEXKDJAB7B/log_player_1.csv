{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price will yield greater profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $950,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **For Alice:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and close to John's offer, maximizing potential profit.
    * **For Bob:**  He saves $50,000 compared to John's offer and gains a valuable product.
* **Negotiation Room:** The message leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high."
