"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 reasoning: While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her product valuation, it's still above my maximum budget. I should negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A significant difference between her asking price and my offer will reveal how flexible she's willing to be. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the option to buy from John at $1,000,000, so my counteroffer acknowledges that I'm serious but have other options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my alternative option price. There's no point in further negotiation or buying from John since I've achieved my goal of finding the product for $1,000,000."
