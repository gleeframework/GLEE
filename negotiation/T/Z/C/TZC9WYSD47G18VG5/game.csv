"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think this is a fair price given its value. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save a bit more.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $110? This is a fair price considering the product's value and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $107.50? That's the best I can do.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. $107.50 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with, but to keep moving forward I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.  How about $108.75? This would ensure we both get a fair deal.",108.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $108.75. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $109.25? That's the best I can do.",109.25,Bob,6,
