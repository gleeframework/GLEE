"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, and it ensures I receive a fair compensation for my investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You have the opportunity to potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's a chance you could negotiate a price closer to your $1,000,000 target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high.  Given the value to me, $1,050,000 is the maximum I can offer at this time.  It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer the product to you for $1,075,000.  This price reflects a fair balance between our respective needs and should allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, which is good. However, her offer is still slightly above what you're willing to pay. You have a chance to get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering again.  You can try a price closer to your limit, seeing if you can get closer to your $1,000,000 target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000 for the product, which is a fair price given the value it holds for both of us. I believe this offer allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $1,025,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a good deal for both parties. Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is right at your maximum budget. It's not ideal, but you're not likely to get a lower price from Alice.  It's a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000, even if it is your maximum price.  Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product without risking further negotiation or the possibility of losing out altogether."
