"Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a great deal for you, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to someone else for $150. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,1,
