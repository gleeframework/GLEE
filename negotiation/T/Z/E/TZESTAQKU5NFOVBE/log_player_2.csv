"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a great deal for you, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to someone else for $150. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
