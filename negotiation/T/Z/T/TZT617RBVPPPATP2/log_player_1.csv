Round 2
Bob's offer:

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. This product holds substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,100,000? I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving the price down in $100,000 increments. While $1,100,000 is a good profit, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to push a bit further to try and get closer to $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While I value your interest, the product's worth is closer to my initial offer.  Let's settle this now - would $1,175,000 work for you?"",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm aiming for a middle ground between his $1,100,000 and my previous $1,200,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong position. Presenting it as a final offer might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, but I think that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly slowed down his price drops.  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting $1,050,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of him dropping further or the negotiation stalling completely. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with John's lower offer."
