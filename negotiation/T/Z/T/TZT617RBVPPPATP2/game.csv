"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our discussion.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. This product holds substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,100,000? I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While I value your interest, the product's worth is closer to my initial offer.  Let's settle this now - would $1,175,000 work for you?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, but I think that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
