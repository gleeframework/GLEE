"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also signals the value I place on the product. I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for just a little bit more than my absolute minimum. I believe I can do better. I want to see if I can push him higher or potentially make a counter-offer to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer and above my minimum.  I hope this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's both fair and profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I hoped to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,700,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than my minimum and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future if needed.  I'm willing to close the deal and move on."
