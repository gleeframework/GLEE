"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,750. It's a fair price, and it allows us to both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a little more. I believe I can get a better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $8,750 is still a little too low. How about we meet at $8,900? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
