"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit out of your budget, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you the product for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice.  To be honest, my absolute top price is $7,000 for this product.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you the product for $8,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Alice,5,
