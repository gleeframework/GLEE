"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to capture most of the potential value. I know Bob values the product at $15,000, so this leaves room for negotiation while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not giving up on getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still leaving room for profit. I believe $13,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's previous offer and my desire to secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price with some more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm willing to drop my price further to $12,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm still comfortable with the price and believe Bob might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,500 is just above my minimum threshold and a better deal than selling to John. I'm running out of rounds, and I'm not confident I can secure a higher price."
