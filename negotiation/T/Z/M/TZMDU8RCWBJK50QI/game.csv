"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Considering its value to me, I'm offering $800,000. I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This price reflects the value it brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,800,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 falls short of what I consider fair for this product. I'm willing to make another adjustment, how about $1,550,000?  This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers interested.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  $1,550,000 is still more than I can afford.  Given our back and forth, I'm willing to go to $1,200,000.  I hope we can close the deal soon.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your constraints, but I need to be mindful of the product's value. Let's make this our final exchange -  $1,425,000. This ensures a fair deal for both of us. ",1425000.0,Alice,7,
