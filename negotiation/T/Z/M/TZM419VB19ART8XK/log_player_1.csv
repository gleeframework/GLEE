Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $80 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. There's no room for negotiation to get a higher price. Selling to John guarantees the same amount with less hassle."
