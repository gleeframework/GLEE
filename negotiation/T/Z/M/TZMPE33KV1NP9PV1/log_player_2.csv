"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. I think you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and  more than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). This means you'll save $3,000 compared to buying from John."
