Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John, hoping to get as much as possible from Bob.  Since he values the product at $120, this gives him room to negotiate, but still leaves me some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better.  I'll counter with a price closer to $150 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm counter-offering at $155.  This is closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he wants to buy it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is now offering significantly less than my minimum. I'm confident that John will buy it for $150, so I'm going to sell it to him."
