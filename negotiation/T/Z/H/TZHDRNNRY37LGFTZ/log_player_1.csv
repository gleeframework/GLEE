Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is interested, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to $130. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum value. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a fair price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum value. I'm willing to take $115 to avoid risking a further negotiation or losing the sale to John."
