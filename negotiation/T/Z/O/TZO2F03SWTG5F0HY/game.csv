"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $14,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that be feasible?",11000.0,Bob,4,
