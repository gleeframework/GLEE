"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $12,000.**  
* **You have room to negotiate.** You can aim for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. 
* **There are multiple rounds available.** This gives you time to bargain.

By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not too low:**  $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for her to make a profit.
* **Shows commitment:**  By offering a price, you're indicating a genuine interest in buying the product. 
* **Sets the stage for negotiation:**  This counteroffer opens the door for further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about $9,500?  It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal, considering its value to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target price.** While it's lower than her original offer, $9,500 is still higher than your desired price range.
* **You still have room for negotiation.**  Alice has shown flexibility, indicating there's potential to reach an agreeable price.
* **You have multiple rounds remaining.** It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and secure a better deal. 

By rejecting, you can make another counteroffer and attempt to bring the price down closer to your target range."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a good price for your product, but $9,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,250. This is a fair offer, and I'm confident it will provide you with a solid profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. It shows you're willing to compromise.
* **Staying within your budget:** $9,250 is still well within your acceptable price range, allowing you to save a significant amount compared to John's offer.
* **Maintaining a firm but respectful tone:** The message conveys your desire to close the deal while emphasizing your financial limitations."
