"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this price. My goal is to gauge his interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is above my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to maximize my profit. $180 is a fair compromise and hopefully, he'll see the value in closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $170, which is a good price and only $10 less than my initial ask.  I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher, and I don't want to risk him walking away entirely. Accepting his offer is the best option in this round."
