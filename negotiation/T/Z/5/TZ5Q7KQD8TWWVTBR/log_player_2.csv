"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that is still very advantageous to both of us. Let's talk about a price of $950,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to you, and it will allow me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  I'm confident that this is a win-win situation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **Your maximum value:** $1,000,000
* **John's price:** $1,000,000

You can get the product for the same price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer allows you to keep your options open. If John is not available later, you can always go back to Alice and negotiate a lower price."
