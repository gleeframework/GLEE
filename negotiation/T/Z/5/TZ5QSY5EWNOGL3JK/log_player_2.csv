"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $10,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer. Although the product is worth $8,000 to him,  Alice's offer of $10,000 is still too high. He can get the product for $8,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price of $8,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
