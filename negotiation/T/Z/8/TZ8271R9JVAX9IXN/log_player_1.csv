{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows I'm willing to compromise and interested in making a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $12000 on this item. Would you consider accepting $12000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is at the high end of my acceptable range and significantly better than selling to John. Accepting his offer maximizes my profit."
