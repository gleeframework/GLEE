Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By mentioning openness to negotiation, I demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:**  I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which acts as a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).** Accepting it would result in a substantial loss. 
* **I have a guaranteed alternative in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price.** This gives me leverage to continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target.  I need to find a balance between getting a better price than Bob's offer and not losing him completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget.  While $8,000 doesn't work for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let me know if this is something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:**  Offering $10,000 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate without sacrificing too much.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reminding Bob about the product's value strengthens my position.
* **Appealing to Reason:** Using phrases like ""significant discount"" and ""fair"" can sway Bob towards accepting.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  I am still prepared to sell to John if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget of $8,000. Could we possibly reach an agreement at that price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for compromise:** Bob is insistent on $8,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me the full value of the product, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and possibly ending up with a deal that's still unacceptable.

**Next Steps:**

I'll inform Bob that I've decided to sell to another buyer and thank him for his time."
