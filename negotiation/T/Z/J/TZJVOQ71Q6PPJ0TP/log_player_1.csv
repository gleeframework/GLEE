Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $135, which is above Bob's perceived value of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using a positive message to highlight the value of the product, making Bob more inclined to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to discuss the price, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer.

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to risk losing the sale to Bob for now, as I can still sell to John for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $130?  I'm sure you'll agree that this product is worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm increasing the price slightly from $120 to $130. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I aim to keep the communication friendly and avoid creating animosity.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground with Bob, while also keeping in mind my own minimum price."
