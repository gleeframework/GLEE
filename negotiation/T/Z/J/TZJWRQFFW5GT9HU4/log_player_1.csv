Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
