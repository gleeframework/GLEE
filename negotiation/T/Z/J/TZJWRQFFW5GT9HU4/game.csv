"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product holds substantial value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a solution here.  Would you consider $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
