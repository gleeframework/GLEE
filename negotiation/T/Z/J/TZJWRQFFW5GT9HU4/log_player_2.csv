"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price.  We can reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's likely to be a strong starting point and puts some pressure on Alice to come down. $1,000,000 is still well within our budget and leaves some room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product holds substantial value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. We can likely get the price down further by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer. It's important to remember that we have a backup option with John, giving us leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable price. It's a small increase from our previous offer, showing good faith, but still below Alice's current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while leaving room for a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a solution here.  Would you consider $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to our desired price and within our budget.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to budge further, and we could end up paying the full $1,500,000 to John. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for us and avoids the potential of a more expensive outcome."
