"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. You have 10 rounds and a backup option, so you have time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to your goal, you can still try to negotiate lower. You've got rounds left and a backup option, so pushing for a better price is worth the effort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is my final offer,  let me know if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's close this deal at $10,875. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're very close to your goal of $10,000, but you have rounds left to try and get even closer.  A counteroffer might get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,875 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try $10,750.  This is truly my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with my other option."", ""product_price"": 10750}
