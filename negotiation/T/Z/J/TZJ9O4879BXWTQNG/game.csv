"Alice,  $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is my final offer,  let me know if it works for you.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's close this deal at $10,875. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,875 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try $10,750.  This is truly my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with my other option.",10750.0,Bob,6,
