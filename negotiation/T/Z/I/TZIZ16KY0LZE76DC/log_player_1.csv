Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it's worth a great deal to someone like you, and I'm happy to offer it for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential benefit, justifying the higher price.
* **First Refusal:**  By framing it as an exclusive opportunity, I create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, I make a substantial profit. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
