"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly less than what you would pay John ($15,000).
* Even though the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, it's worth $15,000 to you, meaning you still get a good deal. 
* It's in your best interest to accept the offer and save $3,000."
