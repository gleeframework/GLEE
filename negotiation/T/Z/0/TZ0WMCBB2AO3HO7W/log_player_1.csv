This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about the price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000.

This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you've placed on it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said,  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a significant offer and reflects the upper limit of what I'm able to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $900,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
