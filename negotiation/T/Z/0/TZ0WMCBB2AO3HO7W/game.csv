"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about the price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you've placed on it.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said,  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a significant offer and reflects the upper limit of what I'm able to spend.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $900,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
