"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is quite high.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is significantly below what I value the product at. To move this forward, I could consider $1,500,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but my budget has limitations.  To be realistic, I can offer $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below both my valuation and John's standing offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more substantial movement from Bob's side."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can go up to $1,050,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within a reasonable budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is making more substantial increases now, his offer is still below John's guaranteed $1,200,000.  I'm willing to see if I can negotiate him up closer to my initial asking price, as there are still a few rounds left."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,250,000. This price reflects the significant value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, I'm getting closer to John's offer.  This offer represents a strong position for me - it's a significant profit over my minimum, and it avoids the risk of Bob walking away if I push further. This ""final offer"" approach adds pressure for Bob to accept."
