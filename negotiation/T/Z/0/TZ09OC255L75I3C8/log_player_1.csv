Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down slightly. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
