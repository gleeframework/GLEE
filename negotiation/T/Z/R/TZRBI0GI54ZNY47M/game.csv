"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $15000, which is the maximum I'm able to spend. Let me know if you're open to that.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product to you for 16500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $16500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $15000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for 16000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $16000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. If you're willing to come down to my offer of $15000, I'm ready to close the deal. If not, I might have to explore other options.",15000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. While I'm ready to buy,  $15050 is still a bit more than my budget allows.  I'm firm on $15000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  If not, I'll have to purchase from John at his price.  This is my final offer.",15000.0,Bob,10,
