"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1000000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I can meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $1050000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to ensure I get a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final offer. I'd like to offer $1080000 for the product. This is my final and best offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I'm afraid $1080000 is still too low for me. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I get a price that meets my minimum. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000, which is the same price I initially offered. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1000000.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
