I'm starting high with $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still getting significantly more than my minimum value.  I'm confident that Bob will likely counteroffer, and I'll be prepared to engage in further negotiation based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price while remaining within his budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can get closer, but I'm not prepared to sell at that price yet. I will make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a slight reduction from my last offer, signaling that I'm willing to compromise but still hoping to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not worth risking further negotiation with Bob. The risk of him continuing to offer lower prices is too high. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of money."
