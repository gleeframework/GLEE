"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you consider $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I could potentially stretch my budget to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.",10000.0,Bob,4,
