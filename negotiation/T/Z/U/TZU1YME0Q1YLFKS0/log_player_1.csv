"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000."",
 ""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting above that figure gives the impression the product might be worth more to him than he initially thinks. 
* **Below John's Offer:**  Even though I can get my minimum acceptable price from John, it's worth seeing if I can make an even better deal with Bob.

By starting the negotiation with a strong but not unreasonable offer, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and set the stage for a potentially profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is too high for me.  Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and my initial offer. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about the product's value and willing to negotiate further to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  Could you do $1,650,000? This feels like a fair compromise to aim for."",
 ""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm lowering my price significantly from the initial offer ($150,000 reduction) to show Bob I'm flexible and want to reach a deal.
* **Above Target, Below Initial:** This counteroffer is still above my desired minimum ($1,500,000) but acknowledges that I'm willing to move from my initial position.
* **Encouraging Movement:** By suggesting $1,650,000, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to make a counter-offer that is closer to my acceptable range.  

This approach maintains a firm stance while encouraging continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my current budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not quite there. I'm choosing to reject his offer of $1,400,000 to signal that I'm firm on getting at least $1,500,000. I'm hoping this will push him to make a final, more substantial jump in the next round. 

We are getting into the later rounds, so the pressure is on for Bob to make a move that works for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price. To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $1,500,000.  To make this work for me, I need to be at that number as well. If you can meet that, we have a deal."",
 ""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  We are over halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I need to push for a close.
* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning the other buyer (John) introduces a sense of urgency and reinforces the value of my product. 
* **Firm Minimum:** By stating $1,500,000 as my absolute minimum, I'm setting a clear boundary. This leaves the ball in Bob's court to either meet the price or walk away.

This approach is firm but fair, and it lets Bob know this is my final offer."
