"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price that considers its worth to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than her initial asking price, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer will allow you to purchase the product at the best possible price."
