Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price that considers its worth to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible while still exceeding her own minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring Alice gets more than she would from John.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning she'll list it publicly, Alice subtly encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the offer seriously."
