"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the value it brings to you. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, while also acknowledging your desire to save some money. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
