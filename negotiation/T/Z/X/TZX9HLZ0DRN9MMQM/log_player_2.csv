Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This would still provide you with a significant value for the product.

We're still quite a bit away from a price I'm happy with. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you consider $750,000?  I believe that would be a fair deal."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle at $800,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable product while ensuring I receive a fair price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept the offer.  Alice is unlikely to go any lower than her product's value to her ($800,000). Accepting now secures you the product for a price well below your maximum budget."
