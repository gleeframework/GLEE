"I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you, and I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe this product will be a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my needs and the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to me is $12,000.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to offer $10,000. This would allow you to make a small profit while still allowing me to purchase the product within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but $10,000 is also below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I can go while still making a decent profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow you to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final price, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,7,
