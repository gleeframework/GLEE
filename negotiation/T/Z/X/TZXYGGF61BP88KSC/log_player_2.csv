"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you, and I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe this product will be a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my needs and the value I see in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price point.  He should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to offer $10,000. This would allow you to make a small profit while still allowing me to purchase the product within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but $10,000 is also below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I can go while still making a decent profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,500 is getting closer to his budget, it's still higher than he wants to pay. He should continue negotiating and try to get a better price.  He also has the option of buying from John, which is a safer option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow you to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final price, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice has come down a bit, she's still unwilling to go lower than $11,000.  John is offering a price that's within Bob's budget and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower offer.  It's better to secure the product now at a price he's comfortable with."
