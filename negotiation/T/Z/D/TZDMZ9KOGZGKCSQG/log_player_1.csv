Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation.  It's also lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need to make a profit. This offer is still higher than John's offer and closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if he's willing to negotiate further.  Rather than risking another rejected counteroffer, I'll sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiations."
