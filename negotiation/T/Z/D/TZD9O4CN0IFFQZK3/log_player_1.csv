Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am only able to pay up to $10000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this range?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too far below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
