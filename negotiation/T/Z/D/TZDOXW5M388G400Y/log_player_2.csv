"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's not the best deal. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $100 for the product, which is still within my budget and a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.  This price is a reasonable starting point for the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. It's also a decent compromise, as I've already lowered the price from her original offer.  Accepting this offer is a good move in this round."
