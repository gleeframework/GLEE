# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

It's always a good idea to start by seeing if you can get a better deal.  Rejecting the initial offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start with $7,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $7500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is a better deal than $10,000, it's still higher than my ideal price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
