"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate and ensures I get a good deal.
* **Positive Message:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, so I leave room for Bob to make a counteroffer if he feels the price is too high. 

**Strategy:**

This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider:

* **Lowering the Price:** Gradually lower the price in subsequent rounds, but not too drastically.
* **Counteroffers:**  Carefully consider Bob's counteroffers and adjust my subsequent offers accordingly.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Remember that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob within 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $10000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start with $7500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my starting price and below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. While I won't accept his offer, I'm not ready to give up on a better price.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I will counter with a price that's closer to my desired range, but still higher than Bob's offer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. I need to be careful not to get too greedy and risk losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is halfway between my minimum price ($8,000) and Bob's offer ($7,500). This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Messaging:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and focusing on finding a fair deal for both of us.
* **Strategic Price:** $8,500 is a reasonable price that allows me to earn a profit but also leaves room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a counteroffer closer to my desired range, I'm signaling that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob. This approach aims to encourage him to make a counteroffer closer to my target price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $8000. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm eager to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **Deal Closing:**  Accepting the offer ensures I sell the product and get my desired minimum price. 
* **Time Constraint:** With 6 rounds remaining,  there's a risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a deal falling through entirely.

**Strategy:**

While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a slightly higher price, the risk of a deal failing or a lower price outweighs the potential gains. This offer provides a good outcome and allows me to move on quickly."
