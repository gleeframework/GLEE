"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This would allow both of us to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from $13,000. I'd like to make another offer of $12,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",12250.0,Bob,4,
