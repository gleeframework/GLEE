"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150 to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $175 leaves room for several rounds of negotiation before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is too low, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that's more acceptable to me. 
* **Selling to John is Not the Best Option Yet:**  I have 10 rounds to close the deal and selling to John now would limit my potential earnings. I'd rather try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $150 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $162.50? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 162.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's a midway point between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Shared Benefit:** I frame the offer as a ""good compromise"" to highlight the potential benefit for both of us. 
* **Maintaining my Position:** The price of $162.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but allows for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $130? This is the highest I can go, but I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, $130 is still below my acceptable range.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I've only had 4 rounds.  There's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Counteroffer Needed:** I need to make another counteroffer to push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to work with me, but $130 is still unfortunately below what I need to make this work.  Let's split the difference again. How about $145? It's closer to your offer, but also allows me to keep some room for profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm proposing a price that's still above my minimum of $150, but is closer to Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but am not desperate.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""split the difference"" to encourage Bob to see it as a fair compromise.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:**  $145 still leaves room for one more counteroffer from Bob if he rejects this one, giving me some leeway to reach a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really struggling to get above $120. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob is offering a bit more, $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Selling to John is Not Ideal Yet:** While I could sell to John for $150, I still have 4 rounds left to negotiate with Bob. There's a chance I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Counteroffer Needed:** I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to push Bob closer to my desired price. I'll try to find a compromise that both of us can accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again, at $142.50.  This would allow us to both walk away with a fair deal.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 142.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150 than Bob's offer, while still showing that I'm open to compromise.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  I'm suggesting a midpoint between our last offers, emphasizing a fair outcome for both of us.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $142.50 allows for one more counteroffer from Bob if he rejects this one, giving me a chance to close the deal.  I am also approaching the point where selling to John might become a more attractive option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, to be honest. I've already gone above my original offer and I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but that's my absolute limit. Can you really not meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, $140 is still below my desired range. 
* **Selling to John is Now an Option:**  With only 2 rounds left, I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John for $150 might be a better option than continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **One More Counteroffer:** However, there's still a chance that I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my minimum. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if I can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your frustration, but $140 is still just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $145 one last time. It's a compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to keep this deal going.  If you're not willing to meet me there, then I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final counteroffer, as we are at round 9. I'm showing that I'm willing to meet halfway, but I need to ensure I get a price close to my minimum.
* **High Stakes:** I'm emphasizing that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll likely have to sell to John for $150. This adds pressure for Bob to close the deal.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise to make it more appealing to Bob, even though it's my final offer. 

I'm hoping that this final offer will convince Bob to close the deal, as I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $140. I've already compromised a lot and I'm not willing to sacrifice my budget further. I think it's time for me to walk away and explore other options. I'll consider buying the product from John for $80 instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiation. 
* **Bob's Offer is Still Unacceptable:** Bob's final offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is the Best Option:**  Since I'm not able to reach an agreement with Bob, and I'm down to the last round, selling to John for $150 is now the best option to secure a profitable deal.  

While I would have preferred to sell to Bob for a higher price, I can't risk losing the sale entirely. Selling to John for $150 ensures I get a reasonable return on my product."
