Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering what you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000,  we don't want to sell ourselves short. Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above our minimum. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value"" and framing it as a pre-public offer, we create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price.
* **Alternative:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John, giving us a strong fallback position. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. How we proceed depends on Bob's response. We can always negotiate down if needed, but going too low initially limits our options."
