"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. Given its significance and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than what the market typically commands. Considering its true value and the fact that it's tailored specifically for individuals like yourself, I am offering it to you for $10,000. This price reflects not only its intrinsic worth but also provides you with a significant advantage compared to its market value. I trust this proposal aligns with your expectations and I look forward to discussing further details if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's message is persuasive, $10,000 is still more than your maximum budget and more expensive than John's offer. You can save $2,000 by going with John."
