"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a fantastic opportunity for you, Bob! I'm willing to let you have this amazing product for a special price of $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is less than John's $100 price, you know you have a backup option.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or see if she'll lower it further."
