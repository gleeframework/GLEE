Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price, and I have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $110? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find this product a great value."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $108 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price with a few more rounds.  I'm not desperate to sell and I know John is waiting if I don't strike a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  How about $112?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $112. Would you be willing to go down to $109? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $109 is tempting, I'm sticking with my strategy of holding out for a bit more. With only four rounds left, I'm getting closer to John's offer of $120. I'm confident I can get a higher price by sticking with my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close, but I still need to be closer to my asking price. How about we compromise on $111? It's only $2 more than your last offer, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 111}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close, but I'm still not comfortable with $111. Would you be willing to go down to $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I'm getting close to a deal with Bob, we are down to the last two rounds. I'm not confident I can push Bob much higher, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the best option for me at this point."
