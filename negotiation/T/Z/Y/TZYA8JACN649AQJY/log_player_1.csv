Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm suggesting a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming for a price closer to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate if he wants, potentially ending up somewhere above the $800,000 guarantee from John.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This price suggests confidence in the product's value without appearing unreasonably greedy. 

The message is crafted to be positive and emphasize the product's value to Bob, increasing the chances of acceptance."
