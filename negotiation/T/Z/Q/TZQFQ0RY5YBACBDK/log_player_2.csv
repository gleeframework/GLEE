"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price, there's no reason to accept it immediately. You can use this opportunity to see if you can get a lower price. Rejecting allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you outlining the value of the product. I'm very interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  I'm ready to make a deal today if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're interested in the product and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. You can either continue negotiating and risk losing the product to John, or accept Alice's offer and save $1000 compared to buying from John.  Given the limited time frame, accepting the offer is the most sensible option."
