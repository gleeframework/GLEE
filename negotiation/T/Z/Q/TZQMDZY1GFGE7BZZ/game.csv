"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good profit margin. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? It's a win-win for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
