"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $750,000. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, as the product is worth more to you than to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000. This price is still above your value for the product, and it allows me to purchase it within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has countered with $725,000, which is still below the price you'd pay John ($800,000).  It's a good compromise and saves you $75,000. You can try to negotiate further, but there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
