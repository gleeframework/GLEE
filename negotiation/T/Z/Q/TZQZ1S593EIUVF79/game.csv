"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800000 to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $750000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700000. This price is still above your value for the product, and it allows me to purchase it within my budget. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
