Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its intrinsic worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob is strategically sound.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $950,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob:
    * He saves $50,000 compared to its value to him ($800,000).
    * The price is significantly lower than my alternative offer ($1,000,000).
* **Negotiation Room:**  This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.

By starting with this strong but still potentially attractive offer to Bob, I increase the likelihood of securing a higher sale price than my fallback option with John."
