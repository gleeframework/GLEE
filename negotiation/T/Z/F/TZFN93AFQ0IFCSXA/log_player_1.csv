Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100** is a starting point that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but not excessively high. This allows for room to negotiate if necessary.
* The **message** is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

By starting with a higher price, I have room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. If he rejects the offer outright, I can consider making a smaller counteroffer or selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation.  While I could potentially negotiate a higher price, the risk of further negotiation could lead to Bob rejecting the offer entirely, forcing me to sell to John for the same price.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice in this scenario."
