"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that could significantly benefit your business and I'm confident it would be worth more than $1,000,000 in your hands. I'm offering it to you for a price that is still very beneficial to both of us. I'm asking for $900,000, which is a fair price considering the potential value it holds for you. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,
