"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1050000? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
