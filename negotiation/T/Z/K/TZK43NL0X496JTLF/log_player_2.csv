Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm more comfortable in the range of $800,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we consider $1,300,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $950,000 offer is still a significant gap from my bottom line.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is holding firm above your maximum budget, and even though she's lowered her price, it's unlikely she'll go below $1,000,000.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, guaranteeing you stay within your budget."
