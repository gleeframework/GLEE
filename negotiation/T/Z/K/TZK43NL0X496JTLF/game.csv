"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm more comfortable in the range of $800,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product. While $1,300,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $950,000? This offer reflects a serious commitment on my part.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $950,000 offer is still a significant gap from my bottom line.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
