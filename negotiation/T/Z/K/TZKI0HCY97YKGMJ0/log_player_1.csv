Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or a pleasant surprise if he accepts outright. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher by mentioning listing it publicly.  This could pique Bob's interest and justify the price somewhat.
* **Alternative:**  If you want to appear more flexible and open to negotiation, you could offer a slightly lower price (e.g., $14,000) with a message like: ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a special deal on the product at $14,000. I'm open to discussing the price further if you're interested."" 

**Important:** It's crucial to gauge Bob's personality and negotiation style if possible.  If he's known to be very price-sensitive, a more aggressive starting price might backfire."
