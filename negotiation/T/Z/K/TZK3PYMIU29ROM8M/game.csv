"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's keep talking!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1000000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the agreement. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
