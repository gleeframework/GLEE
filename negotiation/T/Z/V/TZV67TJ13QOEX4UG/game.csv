"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product and believe it would be a good fit for my business. Would you consider a price of $850,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping to secure a price that fits my budget. Would you consider a price of $900,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us to both achieve our desired outcomes.",900000.0,Bob,4,
