"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product and believe it would be a good fit for my business. Would you consider a price of $850,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than his initial offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price.  I want to see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping to secure a price that fits my budget. Would you consider a price of $900,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us to both achieve our desired outcomes. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good deal considering his budget constraints and the limited rounds remaining. It's better to secure a sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether."
