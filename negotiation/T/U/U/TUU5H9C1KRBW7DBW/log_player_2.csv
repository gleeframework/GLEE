"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,500,000 vs. $1,000,000). Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to lower the price to get a deal done."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and what I've invested in it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his target of $1,000,000. There's still room for Alice to come down further, and Bob might even be able to secure a better deal than what John is offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While $1,150,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing a lower price and avoiding further negotiation with Alice."
