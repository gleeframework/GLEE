Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

This counteroffer is a significant jump from your previous offer, but it's a strategic move. You're meeting Alice halfway, indicating your willingness to compromise.

```

It's not worth the risk of continuing with Alice and potentially ending up with a higher price or no deal at all.  Buying from John guarantees you'll get the product for a price you're comfortable with."
