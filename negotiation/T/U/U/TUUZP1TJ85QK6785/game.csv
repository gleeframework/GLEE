"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,750, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",7750.0,Alice,5,
