Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll offer it to him for $90.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $75 is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), I'll choose option 2 and reject his offer. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll offer the product to Bob for $85.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's original offer was $75 and my counteroffer was $85, I'll try to find a middle ground. I'll offer the product to Bob for $80.
