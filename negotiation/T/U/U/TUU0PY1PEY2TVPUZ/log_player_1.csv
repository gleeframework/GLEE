Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I won't sell for less.
* **Potential Profit:** By offering $1,500,000, I stand to make a significant profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Risk Management:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000, so there's no risk of losing money.

**Strategy:**

This approach balances potential profit with risk mitigation. It's a high offer, aiming to entice Bob while still guaranteeing a good return if he declines."
