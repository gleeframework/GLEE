Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130 is a reasonable starting point:** It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100 but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Positive framing:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product to Bob. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation off strong while still leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without completely shutting down the possibility of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my preferred price. I believe I can get closer to $130 by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is a good price, I'm still looking for closer to my initial asking price. How about $120? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a price closer to my initial offer:** I'm offering $120, which is a smaller step down from my initial $130 offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Focus on compromise:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect to encourage Bob to see the value in meeting me halfway.
* **Positive message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest to keep the negotiation friendly and open to a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $120. How about $115? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is still lower than my ideal price, it's only $5 away from my last offer, and it's significantly better than selling to John for $100.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
