"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  That's a fair price considering I could get it elsewhere for $100.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $110 is my absolute bottom line.  This product is worth more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal for the quality you're getting. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $107?  It's a fair compromise and closer to what I'm able to spend.",107.0,Bob,4,
