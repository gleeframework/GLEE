``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $100 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob the impression that you're willing to compromise and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  That's a fair price considering I could get it elsewhere for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
