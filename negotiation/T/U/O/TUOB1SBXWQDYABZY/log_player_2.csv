"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $115, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you can get it for $100 from John, you have room to counter-offer Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $110 is my absolute bottom line.  This product is worth more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal for the quality you're getting. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

You're still closer to your goal of $100. There's still room for negotiation, and you can try to get Alice closer to your ideal price."
