"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $85, so I'm counteroffering at $102.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm happy to buy it from John for $80 if we can't agree.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $100, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $97.50. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",97.5,Alice,5,
