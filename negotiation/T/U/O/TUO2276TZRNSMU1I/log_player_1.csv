Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $11,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000), but still lower than my minimum value ($12,000). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to start the negotiation process favorably. By setting a price that is reasonable for both parties, it increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. However, if he rejects, I have the option to negotiate further or sell to John for my minimum price."
