{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you still get a good deal if he accepts.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This allows for easy communication and avoids confusion.

Remember, this is just the first step.  I'll be watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly to get the best possible price!"
