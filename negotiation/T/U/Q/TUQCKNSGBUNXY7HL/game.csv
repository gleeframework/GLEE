"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a fair value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering its worth to you is $8,000.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for getting closer to a price point that works for me, Alice.  While $7,500 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500.  Would that work for you?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to the target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $7,200. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest,  $7,000 is the highest I'm comfortable going. If you're able to do that, I'm ready to close the deal. ",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $7,300. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit on this deal.",7300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $7,300 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,100.  That's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on that.",7100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,100 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product for $7,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit on this deal.",7250.0,Alice,9,
