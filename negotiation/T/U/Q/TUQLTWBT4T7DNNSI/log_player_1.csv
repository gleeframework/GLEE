"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm confident the product is worth more than $12,000 to me, so this gives me room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $17,000, trying to meet Bob halfway while still staying above my minimum.  This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm running out of rounds.  Accepting his offer at $16,500 ensures I get a good price and avoid the risk of having to settle for John's lower offer."
