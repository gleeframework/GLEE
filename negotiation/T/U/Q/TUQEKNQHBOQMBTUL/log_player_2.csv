**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $140 is cheaper than buying from John for $150. 
* While you could potentially try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely. 
* Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option."
