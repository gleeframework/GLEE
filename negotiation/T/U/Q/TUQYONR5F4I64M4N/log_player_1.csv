Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing your safety net is selling to John for $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down, while still securing a profit above your minimum.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
