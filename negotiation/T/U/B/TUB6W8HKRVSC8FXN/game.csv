"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  $10,500 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get this product for as close to $10,000 as possible. I'm willing to pay $10,250 right now.  What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get the product for as close to $10,000 as possible, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,750. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,3,
