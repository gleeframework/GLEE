"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially save even more by counter-offering.  Since Bob's maximum is $12,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  $10,500 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get this product for as close to $10,000 as possible. I'm willing to pay $10,250 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get the product for as close to $10,000 as possible, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,750. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  Accepting the offer at $10,750 saves Bob $1,250 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the potential savings are minimal, and the risk of Alice walking away or requiring more negotiation rounds exists.  At this price, accepting the offer is the most pragmatic choice."
