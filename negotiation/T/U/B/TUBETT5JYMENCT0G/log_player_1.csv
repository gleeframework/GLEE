Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to meeting you halfway again, but $8,250 is still a bit too low. How about $8,625?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8625}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $8625 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $8400. Can you meet me there?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is halfway between my last offer and yours. This is a fair price, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short of my budget, but I'm willing to pay $8300. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a better price from Bob.  While $8,300 is close to my minimum, I'm not confident I can secure a higher offer in the remaining rounds.  It's best to secure the sale with John at $8,000 to avoid risking losing out altogether."
