"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,400,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
