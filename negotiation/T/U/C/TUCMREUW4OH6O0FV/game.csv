"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is undeniable. I can come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this price point reflects its true worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's aim for a final agreement that's fair for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's what John is also willing to sell for.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
