"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and counter-offer in the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is undeniable. I can come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this price point reflects its true worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  It makes sense to continue negotiating and see if he can get a better price. There's still room to bargain, and with only 7 rounds left, Bob shouldn't rush into a deal that's not in his best interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's aim for a final agreement that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we are getting closer.  To show you my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Since Alice has stated this is her final offer, it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if he can get a lower price.  Bob has 5 rounds remaining and should be able to get a more favorable deal, especially considering John is willing to sell for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's what John is also willing to sell for.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
