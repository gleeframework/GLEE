Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures you make a profit if he accepts.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price is just above Bob's perceived value ($100), but the ""special price"" framing might make him more inclined to consider it."
