# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $9,000. This is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth the original price I quoted. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8,750.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if a lower price can be reached."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,250. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $8,500, but I'm willing to meet you at $8,375 if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's $8,000 limit. It seems like further negotiation may not yield a price that works for Bob.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000, saving him $375 compared to Alice's offer."
