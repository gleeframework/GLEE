"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it will be highly valuable for your business. My asking price is $1,400,000, which I believe is fair considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you meet me at this price or are you willing to negotiate further?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your financial constraints. However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is the same price you offered in Round 3. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. Can you accept this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
