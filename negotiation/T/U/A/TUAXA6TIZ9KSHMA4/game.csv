"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth.  Let's meet halfway â€“ how about we agree on $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,450,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. I believe this is the maximum I can afford, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
