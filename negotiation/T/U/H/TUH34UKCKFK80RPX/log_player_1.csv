Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be a great fit for you. How does $11,500 sound?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $11,500 is a strong starting point. It's a significant amount above Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but still leaves room for negotiation if he tries to meet you in the middle. 
* **Alternative Buyer Incentive:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, you create a sense of urgency and subtly imply that Bob could miss out if he doesn't act.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
