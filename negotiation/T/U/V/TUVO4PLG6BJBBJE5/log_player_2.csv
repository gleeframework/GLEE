"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high. It's in your best interest to negotiate lower, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation.  Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Anchoring:** By starting low, you anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price range. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves ample room for counteroffers and negotiation.
* **Alternative:** You always have the option to go with John for $8,000, so you're not desperate to accept a bad deal from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value.  Could you consider something closer to $19,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still far above your desired price. While she came down slightly, $19,000 is still significantly higher than your $8,000 limit. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $10,000?  I believe that's a fair offer, considering the market value."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump:** This offer shows a willingness to move towards Alice's price, but not too drastically. It's a jump from $6,000 to $10,000, signaling you're serious about negotiating.
* **Psychological Element:** Offering $10,000 taps into a psychological pricing point. It may feel more reasonable to Alice than a number slightly lower, like $9,500. 
* **Still Below Limit:**  This counteroffer keeps you well below your $8,000 limit, allowing room for further negotiation while ensuring you don't overpay.
* **Market Value Mention:** By mentioning ""market value,"" you subtly remind Alice that her product might not be worth as much as she thinks, encouraging her to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm at $14,000, and even though she came down, it's still considerably more than your $8,000 limit.  Since she's stated this is her final offer, there's little room left for negotiation.  It's time to cut your losses and go with your reliable backup option, John."
