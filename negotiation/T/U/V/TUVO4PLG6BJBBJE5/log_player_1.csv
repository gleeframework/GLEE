Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the asking price."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher number.  Even if the initial offer is rejected, it can influence Bob's counteroffer to be more favorable to you.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While you have John as a backup, maximizing profit with Bob is ideal. If the negotiation goes poorly, you can still walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far below both your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and even his own perceived value ($8,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer, you can try to move the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value.  Could you consider something closer to $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still staying well above your absolute minimum. The substantial drop may signal to Bob that you're willing to negotiate, but not at an extreme discount.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:** Aiming for $19,000 keeps the price point above Bob's perceived value of $8,000. The goal is to highlight the product's worth and potentially settle somewhere between his valuation and your asking price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage with John:** By not drastically dropping the price, you retain the option of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob falter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $10,000?  I believe that's a fair offer, considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly less than your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. There's a chance Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, so it's worth making one more counteroffer before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** This price is only slightly above John's guaranteed offer of $15,000, maximizing your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:**  By stating this is your final offer, you signal seriousness while still giving Bob a chance to accept a price above his perceived value.
* **Time Constraint Implied:**  Even without explicitly mentioning John, moving closer to his offer implies there's a limited window for Bob to accept."
