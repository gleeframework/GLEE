Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that aims to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This allows for a back-and-forth dialogue that might lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 
This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer, but it's closer to his perceived value and gives him a reason to negotiate further. It also shows flexibility and willingness to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will pay my minimum price.  I'll avoid further haggling and sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
