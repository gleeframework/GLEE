"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth more than $100 to me. I'm looking to sell it for $150. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at your maximum price point.  It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a lower counteroffer ($120) gives me room to negotiate.  It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, signaling my desire for a better price.  The message is friendly and respectful, keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider your offer. How about we meet in the middle and set the price at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $135 is still within my budget and a good compromise.  Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation rounds."
