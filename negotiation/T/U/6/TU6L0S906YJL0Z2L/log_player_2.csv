Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to give in yet. I'll meet you at $79.50. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower and at this point, the difference between her offer and John's is small enough to justify taking the sure deal."
