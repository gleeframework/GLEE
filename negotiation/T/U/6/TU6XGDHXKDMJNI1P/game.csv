"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to counter your offer at $825,000. This still represents a premium over the initial asking price, but it's within my financial limits.",825000.0,Bob,4,
