"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's a significant gap between her offer and your maximum willingness to pay. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm going to have to counter with $950,000.  This price acknowledges the product's value to me while still leaving room for a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to earn a significant profit while giving you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000 and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. I can accept the offer and save a substantial amount of money."
