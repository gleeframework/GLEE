Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to sell it for $9,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $10,000, selling to Bob for a higher price is ideal. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob, who might be willing to go slightly higher.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  The price is significantly lower than John's offer, making it seem like a good deal to Bob while still generating a significant profit for Alice."
