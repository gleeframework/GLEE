"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still leaves room for profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
