"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's unlikely Bob will accept it on the first round. This will allow me to gauge his interest and see how high he's willing to go.  I also want to leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. While $1,200,000 is a good deal, I'm not in a rush to sell and want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I'm hoping this will show him I'm serious about selling but still want a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and we're getting close to a mutually acceptable deal.  I'm also wary of risking further rounds and potentially having to settle for John's lower offer."
