Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still a significant profit.
* **Strong Opening:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's closer to my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act fast. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is firm, the wording leaves some subtle room for Bob to counter-offer if he's seriously interested. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a favorable deal with Bob and ensuring I don't miss out on the guaranteed sale to John."
