Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I can see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $7,200. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly on price.  Her offer of $7,200 is still higher than John's price of $8,000. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that makes continued negotiation worthwhile.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
