Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price for its worth."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000 vs. $10,000) and my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value without revealing my bottom line.  
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob. This allows me to be more assertive in my initial offer. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Best-case scenario, I make a profit significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door to finding a mutually agreeable price. I can gradually lower my ask, but I won't go below $15,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** I move on to John and secure my minimum acceptable price."
