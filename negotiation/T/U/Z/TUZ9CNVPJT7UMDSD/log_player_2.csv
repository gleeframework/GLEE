"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm initially offering it at $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is way over his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $15,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good price for you considering it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $13,000 is still too high for him, and he's willing to go with John if he can't get a better price. He should try to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get closer to his desired price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $13,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering your value and my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing we're still a bit apart on price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 isn't quite there yet. How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,250?  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $11,250 is still too high for him.  He's comfortable with John's offer and doesn't want to risk further negotiation with Alice potentially driving the price back up again."
