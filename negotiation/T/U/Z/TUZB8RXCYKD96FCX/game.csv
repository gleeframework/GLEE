"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider meeting me at $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1325000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1325000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1200000, so I'll offer $1225000. Can you consider this price?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
