"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for myself. Since I don't know Bob's perceived value, I'm setting a price that's likely higher than his minimum but hopefully not so high that he immediately rejects it. This approach allows me to gauge his interest and potentially move towards a mutually acceptable price in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I need to hold out for a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating with him and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is still a good profit for me and is a reasonable compromise considering Bob's initial low offer.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but still leaves me with a fair margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John for a better price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $11,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping this offer is more attractive to Bob and will encourage him to come closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me.  While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still hopeful that I can get Bob to come closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm making a final attempt to reach a deal with Bob.  I'm lowering my price again to $10,500, which is still a good profit for me and represents a significant compromise. However, I'm running out of rounds, and if Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to sell to John to ensure I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids the risk of potentially getting a lower price from Bob in the remaining rounds."
