Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business. My initial offer is $950,000. This price reflects the significant value and potential benefits of the product, while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident that this product will be a game changer for you, so let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account my budget constraints. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which recognizes the value you place on this product and my need to ensure a fair return. I believe this is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's aim to close this deal in this round."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $912,500. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and still reflects the value I see in the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $912,500 is a reasonable offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate. This price is significantly higher than selling to John, so it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer."
