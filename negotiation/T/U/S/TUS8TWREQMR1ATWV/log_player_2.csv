``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $140, which is still higher than your maximum budget of $150.
* **John's offer:**  $150, your maximum budget.

**Conclusion:** While John's offer is your limit, it's still better than paying $140 to Alice.  You can reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
