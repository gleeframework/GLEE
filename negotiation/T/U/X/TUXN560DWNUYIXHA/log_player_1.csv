Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it's incredibly valuable and would be a real asset to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a potential $50,000 gain. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions ""offering"" the product, implying a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm happy to purchase the product for $1,050,000.  This price would allow both of us to secure a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is good, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I believe the product is worth more and am willing to fight for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the offer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,050,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - would $1,100,000 work for you?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Understanding:** Acknowledging Bob's offer and perspective keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Remind Bob of the product's worth without being overly aggressive.
* **Compromise (Slightly):**  Moving to $1,100,000 shows a willingness to negotiate but still maintains a strong position. This leaves room for Bob to potentially counter again.
* **Clear Call to Action:**  The ""would $1,100,000 work for you?"" directly prompts Bob for a response and aims to move the negotiation towards a close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product but I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for it. This price is a compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield slightly more, but the potential gains are getting smaller. Each round introduces the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Strong Profit:** $1,075,000 is a healthy profit margin ($75,000 above your minimum). 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Securing the deal now means you have the capital available for other investments or uses. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting a reasonable offer can leave a positive impression on Bob, potentially leading to future business opportunities."
