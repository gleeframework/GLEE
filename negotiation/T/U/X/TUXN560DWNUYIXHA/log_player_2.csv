"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it's incredibly valuable and would be a real asset to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* While John's price is higher than Alice's, rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the offer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,050,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - would $1,100,000 work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning:

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* Even though this offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still too high for Bob.
* Rejecting Alice's offer again allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
