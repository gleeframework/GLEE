Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $19,000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair price considering my needs. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers.  Would you consider $13,500? This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your transparency. However, $15,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay. Given that you have another offer for that price, perhaps there's some wiggle room.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant step from my previous offer.  If you're serious about that other offer, I'm prepared to walk away and purchase from John for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is bluffing. He's trying to create urgency by mentioning John and a lower price, but we know the product is only worth $10,000 to him. Accepting $14,000 is a good deal considering we're past the halfway point in negotiations and it's a solid profit above our minimum."
