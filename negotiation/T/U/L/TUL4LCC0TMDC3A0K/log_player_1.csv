Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant sum. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its potential value."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while staying significantly above his perceived value of $800,000.
* **High Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique opportunity"" and ""significant sum"" to reinforce the value proposition to Bob, even though his perceived value is lower.

This strategy seeks to achieve the best possible outcome for you:

* **Ideal Scenario:** Bob accepts the $950,000 offer, netting you a higher profit.
* **Fallback:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can confidently sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
