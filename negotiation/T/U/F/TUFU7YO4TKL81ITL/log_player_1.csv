Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'll try to get a good price for it. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 7,500}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $7,500, which is a 6.25% discount from its true value to him. Let's see if he accepts or rejects the offer!"
