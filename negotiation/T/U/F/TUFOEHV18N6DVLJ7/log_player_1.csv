Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum threshold of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low right away. I'll see if I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $135. This shows flexibility but still leaves room for me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum threshold and the negotiation seems to be stalling.  It's better to take the deal rather than risk losing both Bob and John."
