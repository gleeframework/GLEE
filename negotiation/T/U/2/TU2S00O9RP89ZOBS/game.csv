"I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"While I appreciate the offer, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you place on it.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $13,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable considering the value I place on it.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",14000.0,Bob,4,
