Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very slowly coming down in price and is unlikely to hit a price that makes it worth continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price that's better than Alice's current offer and only slightly worse than your ideal outcome."
