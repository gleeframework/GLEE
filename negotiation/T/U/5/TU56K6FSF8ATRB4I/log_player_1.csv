Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm starting the conversation at $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's beneficial to begin negotiations with an offer above your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation and signals the product's high value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will likely be too high for Bob, but it helps you gauge his level of interest and willingness to negotiate.  
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,500,000 gives you a strong position. You don't have to settle for less than that amount. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while gathering information about Bob's position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,300,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). You have the leverage of John's offer, so there's room to negotiate further. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that you're serious about a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 falls short of what I'm looking for. This product has significant value that I'm confident justifies a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This recognizes the value while still offering you a good deal."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** By suggesting $1,750,000, you're showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""significant value"" reminds Bob of the product's worth and encourages him to consider a higher price.
* **""Meeting in the middle"":**  This framing can be psychologically persuasive, even though it's not a true middle ground between the initial offers. It encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. However, $1,750,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,450,000 is still below your guaranteed sale price from John ($1,500,000). While you could continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll reach your desired price point. At this stage, the difference is relatively small, and it makes more financial sense to accept the sure thing from John."
