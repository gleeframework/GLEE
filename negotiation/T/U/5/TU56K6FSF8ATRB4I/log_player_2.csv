Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 falls short of what I'm looking for. This product has significant value that I'm confident justifies a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This recognizes the value while still offering you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
