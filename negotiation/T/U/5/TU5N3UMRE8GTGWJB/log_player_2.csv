"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's more beneficial to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts with a bold counteroffer of $9,000, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes Bob's willingness to negotiate and sets a lower starting point for the negotiation.
* **Justified Offer:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, stating it's due to budget constraints. This adds legitimacy to his position and makes it harder for Alice to simply reject it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Bob's message ends with ""Let me know what you think,"" showing flexibility and a willingness to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about $10500? I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to push Alice closer to his desired price.
* **Potential to save:**  Bob has a chance to get the product for less than $10,000 if he continues negotiating. Buying from John at $10,000 would mean missing out on this potential saving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is my absolute limit. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is Bob's final offer, making it clear he's not willing to go higher.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** Bob emphasizes the fairness of the offer, highlighting the product's value and the potential for both parties to benefit.
* **Direct Approach:** Bob directly asks for Alice's decision, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Alice to accept."
