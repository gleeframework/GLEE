"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  He's willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $80. There's room for both of them to find a price they're happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  A counteroffer of $110 is a good starting point. It's a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a better deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer still leaves room for Alice to counter with a price higher than her minimum ($80), allowing for a potential compromise.
* **Staying within Budget:**  $110 is comfortably within Bob's budget of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I see you're interested, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, which is positive.
* **Still Room for Improvement:**  A price of $120 is still higher than Bob's ideal target. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There's still room to bargain and try to get the price closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  Let's split the difference - how about $115?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($120) and Bob's previous offer ($110).
* **Staying Firm:**  Bob is showing that he is serious about getting a lower price, but not being unreasonable. 
* **Final Push:** This could be a good final offer before considering John's offer, especially if Alice is motivated to close the deal."
