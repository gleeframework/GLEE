"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me. This allows room for negotiation and increases the chances of Bob accepting, but also ensures I'm still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if we can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm dropping the price again to $11,000, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This is a good middle ground that still ensures I profit from the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds and Bob's offers are still not meeting my minimum acceptable price.  It's getting too risky to keep negotiating.  I'm going to sell to John for $12,000 to ensure I get the best possible deal."
