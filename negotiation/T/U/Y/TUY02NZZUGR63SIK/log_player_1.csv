Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to your business, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about a price of $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000, my goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first allows me to potentially get a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,400,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), leaving room for negotiation.
    * Attractive enough to potentially sway Bob, as it's a considerable discount from John's offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting high, I leave room for negotiation while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This strategy increases the likelihood of closing a deal with Bob at a price exceeding $1,500,000."
