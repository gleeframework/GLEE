Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm looking to get a better price for this product.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
