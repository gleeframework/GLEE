"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Could you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal. Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110. How about $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $109 for this product. It's a great price for a quality item, and I believe this is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think!",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $109 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",108.0,Bob,6,
