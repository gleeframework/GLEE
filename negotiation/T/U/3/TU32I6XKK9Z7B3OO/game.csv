"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I am not able to pay more than $1600000 for it. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but  $1600000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1650000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the unique value of the product to you.  Let's finalize this deal. ",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While $1650000 is closer to my budget, I still can't justify spending that much on the product. I would like to propose $1625000 as a final offer. I hope this allows us to reach a satisfactory agreement.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
