{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range profitable for Alice. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't go lower than this price."
