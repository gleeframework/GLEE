Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk him getting too comfortable with a low price.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal, and I'd rather not risk losing out completely by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
