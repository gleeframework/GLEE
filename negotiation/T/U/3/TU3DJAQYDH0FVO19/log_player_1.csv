"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about $16,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's keep talking!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, which would be $14,000. That's the highest I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my target price, I'm still not comfortable selling for $14,000. I think I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
