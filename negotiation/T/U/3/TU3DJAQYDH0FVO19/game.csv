"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about $16,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's keep talking!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, which would be $14,000. That's the highest I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
