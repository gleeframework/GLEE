Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above what I know the product is worth to Bob ($100) but below what I know it's worth to me ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is high enough to give me a good starting point, but low enough that Bob might be willing to negotiate. 

This strategy allows for a potential win-win scenario, where I get a higher price than Bob's initial valuation, but he still gets a good deal. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then gauge his interest and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. While it's tempting to try and get something, even at a lower price, rejecting his offer is the best strategy in this situation. 

Here's why:

* **Maintaining Value:** Rejecting the offer reinforces my commitment to my minimum price and prevents setting a precedent for future negotiations.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By rejecting, I open the opportunity for a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as an option allows me to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if the price doesn't meet my expectations.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain a strong position in the negotiation and keep the door open for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  Would you be interested in that?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a Reasonable Range:** I'm lowering my price from the initial offer ($175), but not by much.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a comfortable margin for myself.
* **Keeping the Door Open:**  The price of $125 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it is a step closer to his initial valuation. This demonstrates flexibility while still seeking a fair price.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is kept friendly to encourage continued negotiation.

This counteroffer attempts to strike a balance between my needs and Bob's offer. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can reassess my strategy and decide whether to accept his offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer but $125 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, but it's not ideal.  While I could accept and move on, John offers a better deal. 

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $150 ensures I make a profit.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting Bob's offer at $100 would likely involve more back-and-forth negotiation, which could be time-consuming. 
* **Avoidance of Potential Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer and he walks away, I might be left with no buyer and no sale. Selling to John guarantees a sale and prevents potential loss.

By choosing to sell to John, I maximize my profit, minimize the risk of a failed negotiation, and save time."
