"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential price ceiling.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and its potential benefits for Bob's specific needs helps justify the initial high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message conveys a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price, suggesting flexibility and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the initial price. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant increase, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate, and there's a chance to close a deal closer to your target.  Selling to John would be a last resort at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is a step in the right direction, the value of this product for businesses like yours is substantial.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this reflects the true value and potential it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** You're demonstrating flexibility by making a significant price reduction of $250,000.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message continues to highlight the product's value, reminding Bob of its potential benefits.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The counteroffer is still comfortably above both your minimum and Bob's current offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,700,000. Can we come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Threshold:** Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is getting closer to your $1,500,000 minimum. However, you still have room to negotiate, especially with six rounds remaining.
* **Maintaining Value:** Accepting this offer might signal you're willing to go much lower, potentially leaving money on the table.  You need to show some firmness on price.
* **John as a Backstop:**  The option to sell to John for $1,500,000 gives you a safety net. You don't need to rush into a deal with Bob unless it meets your needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's find a solution. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,825,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. "",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  You're sending a signal that you're reaching your lower limit. The phrase ""final offer"" adds weight to this stance.
* **Significant Concession (Slightly):** You're making a smaller concession this time ($125,000) compared to the previous round, indicating less flexibility.
* **Justification:** You're still emphasizing fairness and the value you bring, but you're leaving Bob with a clear understanding of your position. 
* **Time Pressure:** As you move closer to the 10th round, both you and Bob become more aware of the time constraint. This can sometimes encourage a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go back to my previous offer of $1,600,000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling Tactic:** Bob returning to his previous offer suggests he may be trying to stall or isn't significantly invested in moving closer to your price. 
* **Too Close to John's Offer:**  Accepting $1,600,000 is only a marginal gain over John's guaranteed $1,500,000. It's worth risking another round to see if you can get closer to your target.
* **Time Remaining:**  You still have four rounds left, giving you a bit more leverage to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. I need to be upfront â€“ my absolute lowest price for this product is $1,750,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. I believe it's more than fair, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. "",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Ultimatum:**  You're making it explicitly clear this is your best and final offer. This signals strong resolve to Bob.
* **Walk-Away Point:** Offering $1,750,000 puts you $250,000 above your guaranteed sale to John, providing a reasonable buffer. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  With three rounds left, you're introducing a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision. 
* **Confidence:** By expressing confidence in the deal's value, you might sway Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to sell at $1,750,000, but I'm afraid that's my absolute maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $1,650,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gain, But Acceptable:**  While only $150,000 above your guaranteed sale to John, accepting Bob's offer of $1,650,000 secures a profit beyond your minimum.
* **Limited Time and Options:**  With only two rounds remaining, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Risking further negotiation could push him away entirely.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and avoids the potential of having to accept John's lower offer if negotiations completely break down."
