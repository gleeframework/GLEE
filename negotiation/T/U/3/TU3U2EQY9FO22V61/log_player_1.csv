Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to earn more than my minimum desired price. I'll see if Bob is interested at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'll reject his counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,000. This is still above my minimum price, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is slightly above my minimum price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting close and I'm not sure I'll be able to get much more from Bob. It's also a better deal than selling to John at $12,000. I'll accept Bob's offer."
