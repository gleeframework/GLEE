"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your willingness to walk away.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to walk away if we can't reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to know you're serious about making a deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
