"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to know you're serious about making a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice is firm on her price of $9,000, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  John offers a better deal at $8,000, making it the most logical choice for Bob."
