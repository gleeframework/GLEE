Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum, considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is too low to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still far too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This reflects a compromise on my side, but it's still within my budget and what I believe is a fair price for this product.  Let's try to close this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, we're still significantly above his perceived value of $800,000. Accepting $1,000,000 would be leaving a lot of money on the table. We're better off countering aggressively to see if we can push him higher while still having the safety net of John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $1,000,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  Let's try $1,600,000. This offer stands for this round only, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1600000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part. I believe this price accurately reflects the value of the product for me, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to move on to other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push Bob a little further,  $1,200,000 is a solid offer. It exceeds his perceived value and is close enough to our minimum that the risk of him walking away isn't worth it. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit."
