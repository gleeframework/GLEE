Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000.

It seems like we've reached an impasse with Alice. She's unwilling to budge below $700,000, and her counteroffers are creeping back up. Accepting her offer of $725,000 is the best option at this point, as it secures a significant saving compared to John's price."
