"Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find this offer more appealing.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $750,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $650,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I hope this revised offer is more acceptable to you.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I can appreciate you holding firm on the value, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $675,000. Let's make this deal happen.",675000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $675,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I hope this revised offer is more acceptable to you.",725000.0,Alice,7,
