Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to try to get a better price by counteroffering."

I'm getting frustrated with Bob's unwillingness to budge. I've already lost a few rounds, and it doesn't seem like he's going to meet my minimum price. I need to move on and avoid risking losing more time and money. John's offer of $10,000 is below my ideal, but it's better than risking another rejection from Bob. I'll take John's offer."
