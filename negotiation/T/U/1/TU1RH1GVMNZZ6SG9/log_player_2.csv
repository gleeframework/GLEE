"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $10000 for it. This is a special offer tailored to meet your needs and expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. In light of this, I propose a price of $9500 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering both the value of the product and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget ($12,000):**  $9,500 is a good price, as Bob is comfortable spending up to $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While a lower price is always desirable,  it's likely that further negotiations will be difficult, and there's a risk that Alice might get closer to her minimum price of $8,000.
* **Time is a factor:** Bob has 10 rounds to close the deal, and spending too many rounds negotiating could lead to losing the product to another buyer (John). 

Therefore, accepting the offer is the best option for Bob in this round. It secures the product at a price that's within his budget and leaves room for potentially finding other products or opportunities in the future."
