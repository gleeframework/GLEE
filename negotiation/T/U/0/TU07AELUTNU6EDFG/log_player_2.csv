Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very useful. Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $108 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $109.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $109, which is still within your budget and a good deal considering your maximum is $120. It's likely you won't get a better price, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
