"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $135. We believe this is fair considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price point. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product, as that's what it's worth to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Our proposal for the product is now $125. This is a price that allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $125 is closer to your maximum price point, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth trying to see if Alice will go lower before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $117.50. Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. We've considered your position and would like to propose a price of $122.50 for the product. This price reflects our desire to ensure a fair profit while remaining competitive in the market. We hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, it's getting late in the negotiation. You only have 5 rounds left. It's not guaranteed that you can reach a deal with Alice within the remaining rounds. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for your maximum price point, it's safer to take that option now and avoid risking further negotiation rounds."
