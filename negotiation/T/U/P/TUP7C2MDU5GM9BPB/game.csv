"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my original asking price reflects the true worth and potential this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,750,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, so I'm offering $1,400,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
