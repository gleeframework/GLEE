"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",9000.0,Bob,4,
