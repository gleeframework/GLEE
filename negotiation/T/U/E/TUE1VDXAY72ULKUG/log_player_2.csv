**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($10,000 < $12,000).** This means you're saving money compared to buying from John.
* **The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, meaning you're getting a good deal.**  You're paying $2,000 more than what the product is worth to Alice, but it's still within your budget. 

It's always better to save money when you can, and Alice's offer allows you to do just that."
