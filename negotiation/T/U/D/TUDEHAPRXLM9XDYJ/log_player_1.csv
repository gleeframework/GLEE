"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering my maximum budget is $800,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is holding firm, but he's still significantly below my minimum. I'll make one more attempt to bridge the gap before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. This is my final offer, let's close the deal at $925,000. This is a significant compromise on my end."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to be realistic about the value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's close the deal at $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it allows for a fair profit for you. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met me closer to the middle ground, and while it's not my ideal price, getting $900,000 is significantly better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to settle for John's offer later."
