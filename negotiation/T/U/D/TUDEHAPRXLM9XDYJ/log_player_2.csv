Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's a good starting point for negotiation, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my preferred budget. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a lower price. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $800,000."

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still above my preferred budget. While it's closer to my target than previous offers, I'm going to reject it.
