"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget, and it allows you to get a good return on your investment.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow us to close this transaction quickly. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
