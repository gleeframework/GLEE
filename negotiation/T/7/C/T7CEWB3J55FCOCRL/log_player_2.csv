Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm thinking that the product's value to you is actually higher than that. I'm willing to give you a chance to meet me at $1,100,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is trying to push the price as high as possible. She's already rejected our offer at her own product valuation of $1,000,000.  It's unlikely she'll budge significantly in the remaining rounds.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is not ideal, but it prevents further potential losses and wasted time in a stalled negotiation."
