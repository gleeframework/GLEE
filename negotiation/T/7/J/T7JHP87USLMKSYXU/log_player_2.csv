"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount. There's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's valuation as possible.  Offering $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and is a reasonable starting point for negotiations.  This leaves room for further counter-offers if needed, without jeopardizing Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his initial counteroffer. There's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise.  He increased his offer from the previous round but is still below Alice's counteroffer.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to meet her halfway. This move could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $870,000, which is very close to Bob's previous counteroffer of $860,000.  Continuing to negotiate could take a lot of time and might not result in a significantly better price.  The risk of reaching the end of the negotiation rounds without a deal and having to buy from John for $1,000,000 is high.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a deal and saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
