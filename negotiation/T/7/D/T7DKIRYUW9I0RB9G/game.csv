"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $18,000 for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000. Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $14,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
