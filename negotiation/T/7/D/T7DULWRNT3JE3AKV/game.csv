"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. How about we start at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line.  Let's meet in the middle a bit - would $9,000 be agreeable?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  $8,250 is a tough number for me, but I'm willing to accept $8,750.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,750. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to get it for $8,375. Would you be willing to consider that?",8375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront. I have another interested buyer, and while I'd prefer to close this deal with you, I can't go any lower than $8,625.  This offer stands for today only.",8625.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you have another interested buyer, but I'm still willing to make this deal happen. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,8,
