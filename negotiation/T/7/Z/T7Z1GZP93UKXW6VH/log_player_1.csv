Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, not just the price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm open to counteroffers, as I'm not immediately selling to John. This allows for the possibility of a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows his interest in the product. This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **Avoiding immediate sale:** Selling to John at $1,500,000 would be the most secure option, but I want to see if I can get closer to that value through negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll accept $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects the value you'll get from it, and it's a fair offer for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while staying above my minimum.
* **Value focus:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob again, reminding him of the benefits of owning the product.
* **Fairness:**  The counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a middle ground, suggesting a willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for more negotiation, but not significantly dropping my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this product holds significant value, Alice. However, I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, even though it's a slight improvement.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, and it's possible I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer.
* **Risk of losing John:** While selling to John is always an option, I still believe there's a chance for a better deal with Bob.

I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price."
