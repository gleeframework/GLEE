Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While ideally, we want to get closer to $1,300,000, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are getting into the later rounds. Accepting at $1,225,000 secures a good profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob dropping out in later rounds."
