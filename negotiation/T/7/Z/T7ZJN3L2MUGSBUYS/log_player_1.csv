Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's valuation allows room for negotiation if needed.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to entice Bob and justify the high price.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing for a bolder initial offer to Bob.

By starting high, Alice increases her chances of securing a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation while still ensuring she doesn't lose the sale entirely."
