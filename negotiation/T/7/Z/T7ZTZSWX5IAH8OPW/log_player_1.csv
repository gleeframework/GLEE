Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum threshold of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is still above my minimum acceptable price but shows some willingness to compromise, making it more likely Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  This guarantees I meet my minimum profit goal and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
