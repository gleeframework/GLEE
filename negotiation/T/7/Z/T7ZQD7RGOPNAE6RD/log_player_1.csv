Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I believe we can find a price closer to its actual worth to both of us. How about $900,000? This would still allow me to save some money while acknowledging the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
