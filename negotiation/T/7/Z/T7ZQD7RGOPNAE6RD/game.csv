"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and it's well above my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I believe we can find a price closer to its actual worth to both of us. How about $900,000? This would still allow me to save some money while acknowledging the value you place on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go down that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's still a significant savings for you and closer to the value I'm aiming for.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
