"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  My starting offer is $900,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little steep for me. How about we settle on something closer to $700,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd love to close the deal, $700,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, and I have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $850,000? This still allows for a good profit for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While he's getting closer, $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm hoping to close the deal at a higher price and have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $800,000.  Let's try $825,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? It seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get a slightly higher price, $800,000 is my minimum and it's a good deal for both of us. It's better than selling to John for the same price, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations."
