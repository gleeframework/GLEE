"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1520000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
