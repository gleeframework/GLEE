"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $800,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $800,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be open to that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $820,000, which is still a discount from my initial offer, but I'm getting closer to your target. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $780,000?  That reflects a fair compromise between our positions.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $785,000, which is a compromise that still leaves some room for me to make a profit. I'm excited about the possibility of selling this product to you, and I think this price reflects the value it will bring to you.",785000.0,Alice,7,
