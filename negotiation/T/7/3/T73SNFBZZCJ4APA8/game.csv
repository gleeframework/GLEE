"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value it has for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering your significant gain.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above what I'm able to pay right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
