"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum budget as possible.  A counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, while still being a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price, as there are still rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to strike a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding too many rounds of negotiation.  $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise between his last offer and Alice's latest offer, and could potentially be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget, but it's getting closer. At this point, Bob has to weigh the potential of further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal to John. 

* **Risk of further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer and continues negotiating, there is a chance that Alice will either refuse to lower the price further or become unwilling to sell at all. This could lead to Bob having to buy from John at a higher price.

* **Opportunity cost:**  Every round of negotiation consumes time and energy. Continuing to negotiate may not be worth the potential savings if it takes too long.

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer at $1,350,000 is a reasonable compromise. Bob is still getting a good deal compared to Alice's initial offer, and he avoids the risk of losing the deal to John."
