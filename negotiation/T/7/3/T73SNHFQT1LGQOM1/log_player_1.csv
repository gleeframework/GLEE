Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows John will buy the product for her minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), so she has leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can potentially still secure a price higher than her fallback option.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's ""unique value proposition,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing specific details. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
