"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within his budget, he can potentially do better.  By rejecting the offer, he can explore if a lower price is possible with Alice, or ultimately buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming to quickly test Alice's willingness to negotiate.  He's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still well within his budget.  This strategy allows him to see if Alice is willing to compromise or if she's more likely to hold firm to her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a better price. While $1,100,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still more than what he could get from John. There's a chance he can convince Alice to go lower, so he'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice he's serious about a deal.  He's still aiming for a price lower than Alice's latest offer but is starting to move closer to a potential compromise. This approach increases the likelihood of Alice accepting, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is very close to Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  It's still a bit higher, but considering there are only 5 rounds left and the risk of not getting a better deal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  Bob is saving $12,500 compared to buying from John and is likely to get the product for a price that's lower than what he initially anticipated."
