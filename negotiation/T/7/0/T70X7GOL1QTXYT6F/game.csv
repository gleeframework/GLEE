"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a price well below my minimum while still leaving you a significant profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our interests.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still not able to meet your latest price of $1,350,000. I've carefully considered my budget constraints and I believe the most I can realistically offer is $1,325,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you, allowing us to reach an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
