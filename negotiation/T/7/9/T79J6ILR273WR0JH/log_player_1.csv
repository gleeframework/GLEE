"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price slightly, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable value. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price,  $11,500 is a good deal considering the value to Bob.  It's a better offer than selling to John, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to budge much further. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
