You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can likely get a better price than $1,200,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1125000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  $1,125,000 is a good deal for you, as you are still saving $375,000 compared to Alice's initial offer. It's also a better deal than buying from John."
