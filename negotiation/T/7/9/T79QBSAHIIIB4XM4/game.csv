"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
