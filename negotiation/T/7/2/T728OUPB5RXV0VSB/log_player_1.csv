Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $100 is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80). 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message can make Bob more receptive to the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  By not asking for the full $120 value to Bob, I leave room for Bob to counter with a lower price, and for me to potentially settle on a price that's mutually beneficial. 
* **The alternative buyer:**  Remember, I have John as a backup option at $80, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $90 is only $10 below my desired price and is significantly higher than my fallback option with John ($80).
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, there's a risk that Bob could walk away or we could get locked in a protracted negotiation.
* **Time is money:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid potential delays with further negotiation or dealing with John."
