"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $825,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $800,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
