"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to do $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I could come down a bit, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $108?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
