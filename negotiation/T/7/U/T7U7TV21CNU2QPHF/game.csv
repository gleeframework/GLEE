"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount to you, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $800000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $775000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done. I'm counteroffering at $790000, which is my absolute maximum. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",790000.0,Alice,5,
