I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise.  I want to see if he's willing to pay more than his perceived value, and also leave space for a counteroffer where we can both potentially find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm offering $9,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to get a decent profit while also being a reasonable price for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has come closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with, and we're going back and forth a lot.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $10,000.  It's a safer bet, and I'm not confident I'll get any closer to my ideal price with Bob."
