"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $90.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's try to close this out.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $92 is still not quite there for me. Let's meet in the middle at $93.50.  I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us.",93.5,Alice,5,
