Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $795,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.

It's getting too risky. Alice is clearly holding firm near her last offer.  While we might squeeze out a bit more, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to settle for John's $1,000,000 price."
