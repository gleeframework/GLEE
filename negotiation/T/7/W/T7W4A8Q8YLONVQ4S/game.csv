"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider $107 for the product, which is a bit above your offer. Would you be interested in proceeding with this price?",107.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer, but I still need to save a bit more. Can you meet me at $105 again? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $105 and $107. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $106?",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to sell the product for $106. This brings us right in the middle of our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Shall we proceed with this price?",106.0,Alice,5,
