Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I value your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I still think $1,800,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,850,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is showing willingness to negotiate. We need to push a bit further to maximize profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,875,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my eagerness to close this deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but the increments are getting smaller. Accepting at $1,825,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer. Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob decreasing his offer or the negotiation stalling outweighs the potential reward at this point."
