"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we settle at $10,800? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm hoping you'll find it acceptable.",11200.0,Alice,5,
