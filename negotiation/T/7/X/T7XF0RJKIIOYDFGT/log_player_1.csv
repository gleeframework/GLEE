Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $14,000 gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Knowing Bob's Value:** Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he has incentive to accept an offer below that.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  The offer isn't too aggressive, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation if needed.
* **Protecting My Minimum:** This price is above my minimum of $10,000, so I'm not losing money even if Bob rejects the offer."
