Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $175 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $175 is a bit closer to my minimum, but I think I can get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $175 is still a little lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $187.50? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 187.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $187.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $180 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get a little more, $180 is a good price and it's getting closer to my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's $150 offer."
