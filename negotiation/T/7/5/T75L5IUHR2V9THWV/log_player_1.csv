Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I want to start strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is too low to consider. I need to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob that's more favorable than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer, and it's closer to my desired price point. Accepting his offer is a good compromise, and it ensures I get a better price than I would from John."
