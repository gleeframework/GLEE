"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, this offer is likely to be rejected, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's more than what he values the product at. Accepting this offer is the best course of action in this round."
