"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $950,000. This is the maximum I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better deal, but I also have the option of selling to John for my desired price if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, I would like to propose a price of $1,025,000. This is the highest I can go while still saving money compared to buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, as I believe there is still room for a compromise that benefits both of us.  However, if the negotiations stall, I am prepared to sell to John and secure my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer. However, I need to stay at a price that reflects the true value of this product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I am aware that I have a backup option with John who is willing to pay my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds now, but we're not getting close to my desired price of $1,200,000.  While I'd like to sell to Bob, I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed offer from John for the full amount. 

To maximize my earnings and secure the highest possible price, I will sell the product to John."
