"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what others are paying, but let's start fair. How about we aim for a price around $120? I understand value is subjective, so I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  While John's offer is tempting, there's room to see if Alice will come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $80.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This leaves us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's $100 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering the value it offers, I think a price closer to $100 would be reasonable. This still allows us to cover costs and maintain our business model. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our alternative price of $100. There's no point in further negotiation as John's offer is also $100. We've successfully avoided paying a higher price."
