"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob values the product at $150, and Alice's offer is $140.  While this is a good deal, Bob can potentially save even more by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He knows Alice values the product at $120, so a price of $130 is a good starting point for a counteroffer. This leaves some room for negotiation while still giving Alice a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer to $142, which is only $2 less than what Bob would pay John. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal, and the risk of further negotiation breaking down and forcing Bob to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential benefits. It's more efficient for Bob to simply buy from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
