"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price for the product. I'm also confident Bob will see value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still below my desired price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering with $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to be flexible. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in the hope of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $108. This is a further compromise to show my willingness to reach a deal, while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum.  Given the limited number of rounds, I believe this is a reasonable move to try and close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $104. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $104
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I need to make a decision. While I'd prefer to get closer to $110, Bob's offer of $104 is still higher than what John would pay.  It's a good compromise, considering the time constraint, and ensures I get a better price for the product."
