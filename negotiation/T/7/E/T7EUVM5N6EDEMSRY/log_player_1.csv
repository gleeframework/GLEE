Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a little.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it's worth more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice subtly introduces a sense of urgency and competition by mentioning she'll list the product publicly. This implies other potential buyers exist. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable."
