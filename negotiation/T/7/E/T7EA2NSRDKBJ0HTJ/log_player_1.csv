Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get from this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?
