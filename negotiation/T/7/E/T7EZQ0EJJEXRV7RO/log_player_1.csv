"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit limited on my budget. I'm willing to consider $10500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for now, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go as low as $10,500.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10200 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $10,200 is still too low. I believe there's still room for further negotiation, so I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,200 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,700? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to pay $10400 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've been trying to negotiate with Bob for several rounds now. While he's shown willingness to negotiate, his offers are still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I've only got 4 rounds left. It's becoming increasingly unlikely I'll be able to get a price that meets my minimum threshold.  Given this, it's better to sell the product to John and secure the $12,000."
