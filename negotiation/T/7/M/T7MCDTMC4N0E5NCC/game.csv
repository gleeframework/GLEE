"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $11000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  To finalize this deal, I'd need to stick to my previous offer of $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it gives us both a good deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price that's even closer to your offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12800. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",12800.0,Alice,5,
