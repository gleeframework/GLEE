{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $12,500 is still above my budget. I will reject her offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $10,000, so there is still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your willingness to compromise and my available funds. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my budget, and we're only in round 5. While we could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk running out of time or getting stuck with a price higher than my maximum.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me further negotiation time."
