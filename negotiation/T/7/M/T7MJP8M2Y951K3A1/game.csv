"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still feeling $9,000 is a little high. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $8,750. How about we make it $8,850 and call it a deal? This is my final offer.",8850.0,Alice,5,
