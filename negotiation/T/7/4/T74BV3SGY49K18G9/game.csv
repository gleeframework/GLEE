"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This gives you a great deal on the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $120 is too low, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair price that would allow me to get a good deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
