"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price, but I'm not going any lower than that.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still only able to offer $100 for the product.  It's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125, which is the lowest price I can accept. If you're still not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",125.0,Alice,5,
