Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we discuss a price closer to $11,000? This would allow me to make the purchase while staying within my financial limits.

Bob is holding firm at $11,000 and unlikely to budge. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than to continue haggling with Bob for a potentially lower return."
