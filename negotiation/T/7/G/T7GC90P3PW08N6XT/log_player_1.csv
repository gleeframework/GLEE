{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident in the product's value and am hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $16,000. Could we possibly reach an agreement at $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has been firm on his price, and I've already dropped my asking price once.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal,  selling to Bob for $15,000 is a good outcome. It meets my minimum acceptable price and ensures a sale without the risk of further negotiation."
