Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 gives you leverage.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering a price of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum."
