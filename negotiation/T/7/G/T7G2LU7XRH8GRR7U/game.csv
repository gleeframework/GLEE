"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I would like to propose a price closer to my assessment of the product's worth to me. How about $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $1250000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
