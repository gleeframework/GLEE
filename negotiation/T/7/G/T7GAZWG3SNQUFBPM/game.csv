"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Its true value is immense, and I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business. To demonstrate my confidence in its worth, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This price reflects a significant opportunity for you, and I'm open to discussing it further.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your interest in the product. While $1000000 doesn't fully reflect its true value, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1250000. This offer still gives you a significant advantage and allows me to recover a substantial portion of the product's worth. I'm confident this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. I've reviewed the situation again and decided to increase my counteroffer to $1150000.
