"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this incredible product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This tactic, known as anchoring, aims to set a high initial point in Bob's mind, potentially leading him to consider a higher counteroffer than he might have otherwise. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high starting point allows me ample room to negotiate downwards over the subsequent rounds while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** My message uses positive language to emphasize the product's value and benefits, aiming to influence Bob's perception and encourage him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to negotiate a deal, accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss. It's clear we have a wide gap to bridge, but I'm willing to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, my initial price reflects the significant value this product holds. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer represents a substantial compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a notable reduction from my initial price to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, the decrease is calculated; I'm still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns. This approach aims to keep the negotiation focused on the product's worth.
* **Pressure to Counter:** By making a substantial concession, I'm subtly putting the ball back in Bob's court. He now needs to decide if he's willing to increase his offer considerably or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This reflects a reasonable compromise considering the value I see in the product and my financial capabilities. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still substantially lower than what I'm willing to accept. I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see a more significant move from Bob in the next round. I'm also getting closer to a point where accepting John's offer might make more financial sense than continuing with this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm making another substantial drop in price, aiming to show Bob I'm flexible and want to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We are past the halfway point in the negotiation, and I need to start pushing Bob towards a decision. By framing this as my final offer, I aim to encourage a more decisive response from him. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point is still comfortably above my absolute minimum, allowing me some room to negotiate slightly further if needed while staying above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting much closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, $1,200,000 is still a significant amount less than John's offer. I need to assess if there's still room for Bob to go higher and if the potential profit outweighs the risk of continuing the negotiation.  I will use the next round to signal if I'm willing to go below John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about acquiring this product, and I commend you for that.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,450,000. However, this is my absolute bottom line."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Signal:** By stating this is my ""absolute bottom line,"" I'm signaling to Bob that this is my final offer and I'm unlikely to go any lower. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages him to make a final decision.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is just below John's offer.  This shows Bob I'm willing to make a deal but also emphasizes that I have other options available.
* **Leaving Minimal Room:**  While I've compromised, I'm leaving very little room for further negotiation. Bob now has a clear choice: accept a slightly lower price than my previous offer or risk losing the deal altogether."
