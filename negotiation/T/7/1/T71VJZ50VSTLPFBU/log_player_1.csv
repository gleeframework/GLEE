Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield even greater profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to accept.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**: This framing makes Bob feel valued and could make him more likely to consider the offer seriously."
