"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000 and Alice is offering the product for that exact price, there's no incentive to negotiate further. You can get the product from John for the same price. There's no risk of getting a better deal from Alice, and you save the time and effort of negotiating."
