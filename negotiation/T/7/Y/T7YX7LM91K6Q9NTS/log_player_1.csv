"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've already spoken to another seller who is willing to sell it to me for that price, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While I'd like to get the $12,000 from John, I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob.  He's shown some interest, and I think I can get a better price than his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you've found another seller, but my product is unique and offers value you won't find elsewhere. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and lets us move forward. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,000, which would be $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  $8,500 is closer to my minimum, but I think I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $8,750. This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to the price I was thinking of, which is $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,750, which would be $8,375. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm starting to run out of rounds.  While $8,375 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm better off selling to John for $12,000."
