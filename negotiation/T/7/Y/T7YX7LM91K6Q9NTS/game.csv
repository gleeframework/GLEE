"Bob, I understand you've found another seller, but my product is unique and offers value you won't find elsewhere. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and lets us move forward. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,000, which would be $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,4,
