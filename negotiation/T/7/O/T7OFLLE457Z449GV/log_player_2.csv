"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is under your $100 limit, you know you can get the product for less from John. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price or proceed with purchasing from John at $100."
