"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a better deal than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should see if he can get an even lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. He knows Alice values the product at $8,000, so he starts with a counteroffer of $9,000, which is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This leaves room for Alice to potentially counteroffer, while still allowing Bob to potentially get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting and counteroffering again keeps the negotiation moving and potentially gets a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. Alice's offer of $10,500 is a bit higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $9,000. This counteroffer of $9,500 shows Bob is willing to compromise but still seeks a good price. It's a reasonable middle ground that might push Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's upper limit ($12,000). However, Bob is still within the 10 rounds, and he can likely get a better price than $11,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a deal closer to his ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting very close to his upper limit. By offering $10,000, he is demonstrating a willingness to compromise but still trying to secure a price below his $12,000 threshold. This is a risky move, as Alice may reject it, but it could be the final push needed to get a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is getting dangerously close to Bob's maximum price of $12,000. There are only a few rounds left, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. It's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price.  To avoid the risk of getting stuck with an unfavorable price, Bob should secure the product from John at $12,000, which is still within his budget."
