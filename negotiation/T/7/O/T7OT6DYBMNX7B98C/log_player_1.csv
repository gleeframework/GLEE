Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested.  If he rejects, I can always lower the price, but I want to see if I can get a higher price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum value. Accepting his offer is the best strategy here. It ensures I get a decent price and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or a rejection from Bob."
