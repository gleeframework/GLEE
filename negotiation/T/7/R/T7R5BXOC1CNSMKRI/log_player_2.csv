"Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $1,100,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is still a good deal for you.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that you'll get a better price, and you risk losing the deal entirely. It's worth accepting the offer at this point and saving some time and effort."
