Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly appealing, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This seems like a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
