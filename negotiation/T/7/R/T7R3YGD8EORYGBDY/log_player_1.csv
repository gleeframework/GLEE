Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Starting High:**  A higher initial offer gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Potential Value:**  While the product is worth $100 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives its value to be higher or if it solves a specific need for him urgently. 
 
It's important to note that this is just one strategy.  Depending on your negotiation style and knowledge of Bob, you might choose a different approach."
