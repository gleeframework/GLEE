"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your budget, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,000 is close, but I need to get at least $11,500 for it. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
