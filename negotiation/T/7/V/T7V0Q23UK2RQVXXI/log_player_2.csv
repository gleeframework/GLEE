"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $8,000. Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his ideal value of $8,000. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for further bargaining while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly, but it's still above Bob's ideal value. Rejecting the offer allows for continued negotiation. Bob has 7 rounds remaining, so there's still time to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to slowly but steadily reduce the price.  $9,500 is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's previous offer but still below it. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but not willing to settle for the higher price yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to increase her offer, but it's still far from Bob's ideal value. Bob has 5 rounds remaining, which is enough time to continue negotiating.  There's a good chance Alice will eventually come down in price, especially since her initial offer was quite high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's offer, but he's still holding out for a better deal. He's raised his counteroffer by a smaller increment this time, showing he's willing to compromise but also that he's not going to give in completely. This tactic puts pressure on Alice to come down in price, as she's already rejected a few offers from Bob. With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's upper limit, but with only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not finding a better price is too high. It's likely Alice will continue to increase her offers, as she knows Bob is running out of time. Buying from John, even at a higher price, guarantees Bob the product without the uncertainty of further negotiation. This is the best option to ensure Bob gets the product while still minimizing the risk of overpaying."
