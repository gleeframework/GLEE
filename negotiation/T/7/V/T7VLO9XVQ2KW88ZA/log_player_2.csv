"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer. Starting significantly lower gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer while making it clear we're looking for a substantial discount. 
* **Target Price in Mind:**  While our goal is to pay less than $80, we don't want to immediately jump to that price. There's a chance Alice might accept a lower offer if she's motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $90 is still significantly higher than our target and John's offer.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we're serious about a lower price and willing to walk away. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** We're getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes the better option, but there's still potential for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to do $70? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Move Towards Target:**  We're inching closer to our ideal price while still leaving room for a final compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""the highest I can go,"" we create a sense of urgency and finality for Alice. 
* **John's Offer in Sight:** We're nearing the point where John's offer becomes more appealing. Alice needs to make a competitive offer soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has made it clear this is her final concession.  
* **John's Offer is Better:**  $85 is still more expensive than John's guaranteed offer of $80. 
* **No More Room for Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks losing John's deal without a guarantee of a better price from Alice."
