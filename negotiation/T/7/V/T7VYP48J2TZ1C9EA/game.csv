"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also looking to save some money. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500? That way, you get a great price, and I can still make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and your willingness to negotiate.  $9800 is closer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle again?  Let's go with $10150.  That's a good price for both of us. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,
