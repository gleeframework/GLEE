"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $1,100,000 is too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $1,175,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. If this isn't acceptable, I will have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
