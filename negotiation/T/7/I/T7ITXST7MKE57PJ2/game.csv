"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  If that doesn't work, let me know what might be possible.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you see the value, but $5,000 is significantly below its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair offer considering its benefits.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider something closer to $6,500? I think that would be a fair deal.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I want to find a price that works, $6,500 is too low for me to consider.  My final offer is $14,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to reach a deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
