"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $140 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $155? That way we can both be happy with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 155}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $155 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? That way we can close the deal and you'll still be getting your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $150 meets my minimum price. It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept it."
