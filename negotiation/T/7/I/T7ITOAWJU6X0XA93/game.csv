"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $140 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $155? That way we can both be happy with the transaction.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $155 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? That way we can close the deal and you'll still be getting your asking price.",150.0,Bob,4,
