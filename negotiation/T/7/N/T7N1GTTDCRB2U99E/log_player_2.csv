Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go a bit lower but $1,075,000 is still too far off.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see your point, but I'm still hoping to get it for $1,075,000. That's a fair price for a product worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
