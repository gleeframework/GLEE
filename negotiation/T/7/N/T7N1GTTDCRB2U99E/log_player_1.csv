Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your initial offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm still not comfortable settling for that price.  I think we can do better."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go a bit lower but $1,075,000 is still too far off.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1087500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point, but I'm still hoping to get it for $1,075,000. That's a fair price for a product worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiations, and Bob is still pushing for a lower price than I'm comfortable with. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm concerned that I might not be able to reach a deal that's truly beneficial for me.  John's offer is a secure $1,000,000, which is a reasonable amount, considering my minimum price.  I'll take the guaranteed money and sell to John."
