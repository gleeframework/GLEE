Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations. I will counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $130. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him considering his valuation of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to get closer to my original asking price, $125 is a good deal considering the possibility of Bob rejecting any further counteroffers and me being forced to sell to John for $100.  This outcome allows me to get a higher price while ensuring a successful sale."
