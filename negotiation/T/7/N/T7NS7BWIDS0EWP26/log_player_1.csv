"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a high anchor price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). While it might seem extreme, it sets the stage for a potential compromise closer to your desired range.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly justifying the high price. 
 
**Important:** This is just the first move. How you proceed will depend entirely on Bob's response and counteroffers in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is way too high. I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000 for this product. I understand it's valuable to you, but it's simply not worth that much to me. Let's start with this price and see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his message indicates his perceived value, you have plenty of room for negotiation and rounds left. Selling to John at this stage would be leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. It offers a lot of unique value that might not be immediately apparent. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair offer considering its potential."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer but reiterates your stance that it's too low.
* **Strategic Concession:** The price drop is substantial ($300,000), signaling a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still significantly above Bob's offer, aiming to bring him closer to your range.
* **Highlighting Value:** By subtly emphasizing ""unique value,"" you're reminding Bob of potential benefits he might be overlooking.

**Overall Strategy:**

The goal is to engage in a price negotiation dance, slowly moving towards a mutually acceptable price without conceding too much too quickly. You are still in a strong position with the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased significantly, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate and are better off seeing if you can get closer to your target in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be frank, $1,000,000 is still a tough pill to swallow for a product of this caliber.  I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. I believe this reflects its real value while acknowledging your constraints."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Appreciative:** You're being more direct about the offer being too low while still acknowledging Bob's effort.
* **Significant Drop, But Above Threshold:**  You're dropping the price by $200,000, another considerable concession. However, it keeps you safely above your  $1,500,000 walk-away point. 
* **Finality Hint:** The phrase ""willing to *consider*"" subtly implies this might be one of your final offers before seriously considering John's offer.

**The Next Steps:**

It's crucial to pay close attention to Bob's response now. If he doesn't make a significant move towards your range in the next round or two, it might be time to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for this product. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer! While Bob's offer is getting more tempting, it's still $300,000 below your minimum. You have four rounds left and the safety of John's offer. It's worth seeing if you can push Bob a bit further. 

**Next Steps:**

Your next counteroffer should be firm but still leave a little room for negotiation. You're aiming to either secure a deal above $1,500,000 or walk away knowing you got the best possible outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a deal. I've considered carefully, and to be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready at $1,500,000.  However, I value our discussions and believe we can still find an agreement. My final offer is $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Deadline:**  You're being very clear about your bottom line and the existence of another buyer. This creates a sense of urgency and limits further negotiation.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you're signaling that you're prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept.
* **Slight Compromise:** You're still above your walk-away point but showing some flexibility.

**The Ball is in Bob's Court:** 

This counteroffer puts significant pressure on Bob. It's likely he'll either accept this offer, counter with a price very close to it, or the deal will fall through. You've positioned yourself to get the best possible outcome."
