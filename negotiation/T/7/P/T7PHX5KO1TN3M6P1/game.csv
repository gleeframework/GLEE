"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $13200. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13200.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.
