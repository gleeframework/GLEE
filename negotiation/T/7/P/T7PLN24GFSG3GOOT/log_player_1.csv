Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is a strong starting point. It's a price that could be enticing to Bob if he's interested, as it's just below my minimum and leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell to John for $120. This safety net allows me to confidently aim higher with Bob."
