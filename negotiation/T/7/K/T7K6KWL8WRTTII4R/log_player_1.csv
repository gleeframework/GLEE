{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of getting a higher price. I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by mentioning that I think he'll like the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $60, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you and it gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $72.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $72.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $80.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be fair.  I can't go as low as $72.50, but I'm willing to meet you at $77.50. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 77.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $79? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's only $1 more than John's offer, it's worth it to me to close the deal with Bob.  I've successfully negotiated a price that's close to my minimum acceptable price and it's likely that if I were to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, we would likely end up at a similar price.  Additionally, building a relationship with Bob could be beneficial in the future."
