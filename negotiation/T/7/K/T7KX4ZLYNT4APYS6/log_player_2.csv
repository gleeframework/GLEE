"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price significantly below its worth to you, and I get a fair price. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. He has room to negotiate since his maximum budget is $15,000 and the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore if he can secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000? This would still leave you with a good profit, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential deal, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a fantastic price for you considering the product's worth to you, and it would allow me to make a decent profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $11,000 is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While there's still room for negotiation, accepting the offer now guarantees a purchase at a good price. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Rejecting the offer might lead to more negotiation, but there's a chance Alice might become unwilling to negotiate further, or Bob could end up paying more than $11,000. 

It's a good balance between securing a good price and minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
