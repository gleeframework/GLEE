"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price given its value and your asking price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the true value this product brings. I'm confident it can significantly impact your operations, potentially exceeding even your own initial valuation.  Would you be willing to consider $1,175,000? ",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your point about the product's potential, but I still think $1,175,000 is too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
