Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However,  $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  This is a fair offer considering the price I can get it from elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

**Reasoning:** Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price.  While he is slowly increasing his offer, we are still in a strong position with John's guaranteed offer as a backup.  We need to signal that we are willing to walk away if Bob doesn't make a significant jump."
