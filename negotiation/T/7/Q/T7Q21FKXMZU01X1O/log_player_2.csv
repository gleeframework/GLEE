Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $650,000 remains far below the product's value. This offer barely covers my baseline. I'm open to a fair deal - how about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is appreciated, but we're still very far apart. I need to see a significant move towards my valuation for this to make sense. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a much higher price.  I'm offering you the chance to acquire this at $1,100,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing hardball and her price drops aren't significant enough. While she claims to have another buyer, it's impossible to verify, and could just be a negotiation tactic. It's very unlikely she'll come down to a price close to your $800,000 limit.  Cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
