"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find a more realistic price point. I can go up to $650,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $650,000 remains far below the product's value. This offer barely covers my baseline. I'm open to a fair deal - how about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However,  $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  This is a fair offer considering the price I can get it from elsewhere.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is appreciated, but we're still very far apart. I need to see a significant move towards my valuation for this to make sense. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a much higher price.  I'm offering you the chance to acquire this at $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
