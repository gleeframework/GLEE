"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500.  I believe it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy the product for $14000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000, I'm not ready to give up yet. I have 8 rounds left and I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but I'm hoping to secure a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14000.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a stalemate.  Bob is insistent on $14,000, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm unlikely to get much closer to my desired $15,000.  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal and losing out on a guaranteed $15,000 from John is too high. It's time to cut my losses and secure the safe option."
