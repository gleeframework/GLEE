"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider coming down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $875,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me right now. How about we settle at $800,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a price you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the product's value to me is $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
