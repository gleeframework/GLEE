Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a price you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're saving a significant amount:** $850,000 is a $350,000 savings compared to John's offer.
* **Alice is unlikely to go lower:** She's already stated this is her lowest price and mentioned her own valuation.
* **Continuing the negotiation is risky:** You only have a few rounds left, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. You could end up with a worse deal or having to buy from John anyway."
