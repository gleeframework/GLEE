"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to you, and Alice's offer is far too high.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high, but getting closer to your limit.  Rejecting and counter-offering again might lead to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer is closer to your maximum limit, but still lower than Alice's price. It shows you are willing to negotiate but also have a clear price point in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, even though she has lowered it slightly. It seems unlikely she'll come down further, and you're at risk of wasting more time negotiating.  Buying from John for $10,000 is the best option to ensure you get the product at your desired price."
