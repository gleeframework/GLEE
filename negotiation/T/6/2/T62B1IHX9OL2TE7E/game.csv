"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a fair price. My initial offer is $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $105?  That would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",105.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sure you understand that this product is worth a lot more to you than $95.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go any lower than $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away happy.",100.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, but $85 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference at $90? This would be a great deal for you and a fair price for me. Let's close this deal.",90.0,Alice,7,
