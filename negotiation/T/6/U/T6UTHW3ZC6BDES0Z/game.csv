,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?  Let's see if we can find a price we both feel good about.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $82? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now.",80.0,Bob,4,
