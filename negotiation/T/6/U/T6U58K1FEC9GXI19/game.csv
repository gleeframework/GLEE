"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get out of it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it can generate much more for you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects its true worth while still providing you a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $900,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your perspective.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,6,
