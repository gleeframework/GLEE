Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $120, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for Bob to counter-offer:** If Bob rejects $140, there's a chance he might counter with a price between $120 and $140, which is still profitable for you.
* **Considering the alternative:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150.  Offering it to Bob for $140 gives him a chance to benefit, while still earning you a profit."
