"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1800000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and features. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $1500000, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1600000. This is my absolute last offer, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
