Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so that's the absolute ceiling for any offer.
* **Minimum Acceptable:** You're secure knowing John will buy it for $1,000,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,350,000 leaves a significant potential profit ($350,000) for you while still providing Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob, avoiding the need to go to John."
