"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $130. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. You should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John for $100 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price and our maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is friendly but clearly states our position without being overly aggressive. 
* **Aiming for Savings:**  While we could offer closer to $100, aiming lower increases the potential for saving more money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your budget, $110 is still above what you're willing to pay. You can try to negotiate further since you have the backup option of buying from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. I'm willing to move up a bit, how about $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Compromise:** By increasing our offer, we demonstrate to Alice that we are flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Incremental Increase:** We don't want to jump too high too quickly. A smaller increase keeps us within a reasonable range of our budget and leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** We're still below our maximum budget and have John's offer as a backup, giving us leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up on the price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $115. I think the product's value is worth it. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much from her $115 offer. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that's acceptable for you.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it's more advantageous to do that and stay within your budget."
