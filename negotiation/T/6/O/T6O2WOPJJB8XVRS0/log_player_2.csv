"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000.  He needs to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $12500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is a significant step down from her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I would be able to purchase the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $10000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $13000. It's a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice has lowered her price, it is still above Bob's maximum budget.  There is only a limited number of rounds, and Bob needs to ensure he gets the best deal possible. Since John is offering a price well within Bob's budget, it makes sense to buy the product from him."
