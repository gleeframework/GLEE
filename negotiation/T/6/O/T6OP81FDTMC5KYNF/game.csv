"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit steep for me. How about $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $120.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I really need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go below $140. I'm thinking that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options.",130.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,7,
