"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  While $1,200,000 is a better offer than his initial rejection, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell it for that low of a price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while also allowing me to recoup some of my investment. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to recoup your investment, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price,  $1,250,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I will continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,400,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is the same price I mentioned in my initial counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate with Bob. He's unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,400,000. It's time to move on and accept the guaranteed offer from John.  It's not ideal, but it's the best way to ensure I get a fair price for the product."
