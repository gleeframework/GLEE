"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to try a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than what Bob offered. I think this will be a good compromise point and might entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm now offering my minimum price. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept, as I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and having to sell to John for the same price."
