"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you. Considering its potential to generate $1,000,000 in value for your business, I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects its worth and allows for a substantial return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is less than $800,000 to you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. While $850,000 is tempting, I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
