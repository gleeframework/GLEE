{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's below your minimum:**  My minimum is $12,000, so this offer leaves room for negotiation without compromising my bottom line.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  This price establishes a clear expectation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 

I'm confident this will lead to a productive negotiation, and I'm ready to counter if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, his message indicates he's interested in the product. This opens up the opportunity for further negotiation. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to bridge the gap and hopefully reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraint. While I can't go as low as $10,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000?  This reflects the value of the product for you, while also ensuring I can make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My previous offer was $11,500, and Bob's offer was $10,500.  Meeting halfway at $11,000 shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a profit:**  This offer still allows me to make a profit, as it's above my minimum of $12,000.
* **Strong but fair:**  It's a strong counteroffer but still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is unwilling to go higher.

I'm optimistic that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and move us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm really interested in making a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible, but risk is increasing:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough.  However, with each round, the risk of reaching a deal decreases. 
* **John's offer remains a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I still have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John.

**Next Steps:** 

I will counter Bob's offer one last time with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still below my minimum. If Bob rejects this final counteroffer, I will accept John's offer to guarantee a sale at my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession. $11,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. I hope you'll consider this as a sign of good faith and accept this offer. If not, I'll have to accept another offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** I've already met Bob halfway and made several concessions. This offer is a final attempt to reach a deal.
* **High-pressure tactic:**  Mentioning the other offer from John adds pressure to Bob and might encourage him to accept.
* **Minimizing loss:**  $11,000 is still closer to my minimum than Bob's offer, and if rejected, I can move on to John. 

This counteroffer is a calculated risk, aiming to secure a deal with Bob while minimizing potential losses."
