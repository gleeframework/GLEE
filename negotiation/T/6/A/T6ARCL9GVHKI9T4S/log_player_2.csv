Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having a good conversation. I can see you're serious about the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,350,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $1,550,000? It's a bit above your last offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of her increasing her price again. Buying from John at $1,500,000 guarantees you get the product at the best known price."
