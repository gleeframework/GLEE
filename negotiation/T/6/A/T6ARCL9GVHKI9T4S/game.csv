"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,800,000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,800,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I can't meet you at $1,600,000.  Would you consider $1,350,000?  It's a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having a good conversation. I can see you're serious about the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,350,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $1,550,000? It's a bit above your last offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
