"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, I understand where you're coming from. To be honest, $7,000 is cutting it quite close to the lowest I can go.  How about we split the difference again at $8,500 and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is very close, but to be completely frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be fair to myself.  If you're able to meet me at $8,250, I'm willing to close the deal right now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000. She's introduced another buyer to add pressure, and her offers are decreasing slowly. It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000 than risk Alice not budging further."
