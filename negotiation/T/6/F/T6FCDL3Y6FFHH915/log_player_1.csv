{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you'll make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It avoids ambiguity and sets the stage for a productive conversation. 

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's important to remember that you're aiming to get as much money as possible for the product, and $1,000,000 is significantly lower than your desired minimum of $1,500,000.  While you could sell to John now for $1,500,000, it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal with Bob first. You can still potentially earn more money by counter-offering and seeing if you can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 simply won't work for me.  It's significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,150,000? That's still a fair price considering the value to you, and it gives us both a chance to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer strikes a balance:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows you're willing to negotiate but not at a major loss.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:**  This signals your willingness to compromise.
* **It's not too far from Bob's offer:** This keeps the negotiation realistic and might encourage Bob to come closer to your desired price. 

Let's see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and should be a good compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still too low.  You're aiming for $1,500,000, and you can still get closer to that by continuing to negotiate. 

There's a good chance Bob will come up again if you counteroffer. He's already shown a willingness to move from his initial $1,000,000 offer. Let's see if we can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway between your previous offer and his last offer. This shows you're serious about finding a solution.
* **It's still above your minimum:** This ensures you'll make a profit, even if it's not your ideal outcome.
* **It sets a clear endpoint:** You're making it clear that this is your final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.

By offering $1,100,000, you're demonstrating a commitment to a deal while also keeping the negotiation moving forward."
