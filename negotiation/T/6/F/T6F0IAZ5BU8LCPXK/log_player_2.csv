"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  Bob is starting with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's opening price. However, it's still within the realm of reason, acknowledging the product's worth.
* **Setting the Tone:** This counteroffer establishes Bob's intent to negotiate aggressively and potentially get a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  Bob leaves room for compromise by starting at $8,500, as Alice will likely counter with a price closer to her target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000? This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price and has time to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his target price of $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** Bob frames his offer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Alice's sense of reason and a desire to close the deal.
* **Confidence and Readiness:**  Bob expresses confidence in the offer and his readiness to close, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,900. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to Bob's target of $8,500. 
* **Limited Time:** With only 5 rounds left, continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Alice might reject another counteroffer, there's no guarantee she'll budge further. Accepting this offer secures a good deal with minimal risk."
