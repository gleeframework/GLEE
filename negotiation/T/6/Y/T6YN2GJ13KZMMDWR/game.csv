"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
