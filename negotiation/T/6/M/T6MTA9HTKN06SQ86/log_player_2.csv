"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm looking for $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is asking for $1,100,000. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a better price.

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer Alice with a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  You're starting with a strong counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Sets the tone:** This shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal and you're willing to push for it.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** You've given Alice space to come down slightly from her initial offer without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your target:** While she has come down from her initial offer, she's still asking for $1,050,000, which is $50,000 over your limit.
* **You can likely get a better price:** You have 7 more rounds to negotiate, and Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise. 

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap and get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to your target:** You're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product but you need to stay within your budget.
* **Fair compromise:** The offer is a reasonable compromise between your previous offer and Alice's last offer.
* **Setting the stage for a potential deal:** This counteroffer could lead to a quick agreement, especially if Alice is motivated to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my own costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your limit:** While she's come down again, she's still asking for $1,075,000, which is above your $1,000,000 limit. 
* **You're approaching your deadline:** You've only got 5 rounds left, so you need to be more aggressive in your negotiations.
* **Jhon is a viable alternative:** You have a backup option in John, who's willing to sell at your target price.

**Next Steps:** You need to make a counteroffer that pushes Alice closer to your desired price. It's time to start considering whether buying from John is a better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to finalize this deal at $1,010,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1010000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This signals to Alice that you're serious about reaching a deal, but you're also at your limit.
* **Slight Increase:** While still below your $1,000,000 limit, you've increased your offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Pressure:**  This gives Alice a clear incentive to accept your offer, as the next round might mean you go with John.

**Strategy:**

* **John as leverage:**  Your ability to buy from John at $1,000,000 gives you bargaining power.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is your final offer, you create urgency. 
* **Watch for Alice's reaction:** If Alice rejects this offer, you'll have to carefully consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,010,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1,030,000. This is the last offer I'm willing to make, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 and Alice is asking for $1,030,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  You only have 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely you can push Alice down any further.
* **John is a better deal:**  You have a guaranteed deal with John at $1,000,000, which is within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation.

**Next Steps:** Buying from John is the most logical choice, as it secures the product at your desired price and avoids the risk of continuing a potentially unsuccessful negotiation with Alice."
