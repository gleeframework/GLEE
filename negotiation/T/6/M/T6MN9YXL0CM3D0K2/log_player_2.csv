Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is not budging significantly from her offer, and it appears unlikely she'll go below $900,000.  Since you can get the product for $800,000 from John, it's time to cut your losses with Alice and take the guaranteed deal."
