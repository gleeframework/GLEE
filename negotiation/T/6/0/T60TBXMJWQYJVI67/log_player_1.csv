{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $10,000, maximizing your potential profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  At $13,000, Bob still sees a potential gain of $2,000, making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for both you and Bob to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher. There's a chance you can still get a better price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at a higher amount, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would still leave you with a good deal, and would allow me to get closer to my desired price. "", ""product_price"": 11500}
