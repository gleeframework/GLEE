"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $12,000 is significantly below what I can accept. Could you do $18,000? This product is truly worth it.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $18,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $14,000?  That's a fair offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $16,000?  That's my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
