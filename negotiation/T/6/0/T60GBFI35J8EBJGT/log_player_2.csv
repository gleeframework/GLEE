"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

$80 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  You want to see if you can get a better deal.  You can always buy from John later if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, dropping the price by 25%. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and encourages her to negotiate. If she rejects, I can always adjust my offer in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer. While I would prefer to pay $60, $70 is still a good deal compared to John's price of $150. It's also likely that further negotiation will be incremental, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
