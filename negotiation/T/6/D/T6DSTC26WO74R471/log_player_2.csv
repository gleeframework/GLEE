"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by rejecting the offer and negotiating. There are still 9 rounds left, and Bob can try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,800. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,800, which is very close to Bob's ideal price of $8,500.  While there's still room for negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John or having Alice raise the price again is high.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price and avoids further haggling."
