Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you aim to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price ($14,999) leaves a small margin for potential haggling from Bob while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not mentioning John, there's a subtle implication that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act."
