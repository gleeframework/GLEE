"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for this product.  I think this is a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I'm a serious buyer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this price is more reasonable. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This is a fair compromise and shows my genuine interest in purchasing the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think this price is the minimum I can accept. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value and uniqueness.
