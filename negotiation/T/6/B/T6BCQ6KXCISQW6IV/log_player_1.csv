"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a justification for the price, even though it's a bit high. This might make Bob more willing to negotiate. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states I'm open to negotiation. This encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he's shown interest.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation and show that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $105?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm making a counter-offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, suggesting a willingness to find a solution.
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a justification for my counter-offer, reinforcing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject his offer, there's a risk he'll walk away, and I'll have to sell to John for $100.
* **Time is Limited:**  We're already in Round 4, and I want to close the deal before running out of rounds. 

By accepting his offer, I secure a sale that's within a reasonable range of my minimum price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
