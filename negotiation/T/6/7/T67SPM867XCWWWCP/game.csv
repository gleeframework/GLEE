"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think, Bob?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to make another concession. However, $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1220000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1220000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1280000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to make another concession. However, $1280000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1220000 for the product, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to go any higher than this. Can you consider this price?",1220000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're going around in circles, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1280000, and I think we've already discussed that price. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away the product for too cheap. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,9,
