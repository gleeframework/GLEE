"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1000000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000,  which is still a good deal for a product of this caliber. Let's find a way to make this work.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This is a fair price considering my maximum limit. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you.  $1250000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1500000. This is a fair price, and it's the lowest I can go while still ensuring I get a reasonable return.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1500000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1350000. This is the absolute highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
