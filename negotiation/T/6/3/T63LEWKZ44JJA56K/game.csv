"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is simply too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value and potential this product offers.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that this product has value, but I have a firm budget in mind. I can increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, taking anything less than $1,200,000 would be selling this product short. That's my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
