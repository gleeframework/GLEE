"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,500,000. I'm confident its value will become clear as we discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is simply too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While Alice's starting price is high, we begin with a significantly lower counter-offer. This strategy aims to bring the negotiation closer to our desired range.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the counter-offer (""fair price that reflects its value to me"") can make the negotiation feel more collaborative. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial counter-offer gives us ample room to negotiate upwards in subsequent rounds if needed, while still staying well below our $1,000,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value and potential this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand that this product has value, but I have a firm budget in mind. I can increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We are gradually increasing our offer to show Alice we are serious about the purchase, but we're not jumping drastically towards her price. 
* **Firm Budget:** By mentioning a ""firm budget,"" we signal to Alice that we have a limit and won't be easily swayed to go much higher.
* **Urgency and Compromise:**  Phrases like ""hopeful we can reach an agreement"" subtly introduce a sense of urgency and a desire to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, taking anything less than $1,200,000 would be selling this product short. That's my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her ""absolute bottom line"" of $1,200,000.  This is more than we are willing to pay. Since we have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes the most financial sense to take that deal.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price that meets our needs."
