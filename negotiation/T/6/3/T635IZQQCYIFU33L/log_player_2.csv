# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $90?"",

``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives us room to negotiate upwards."

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. We'll counter with a price closer to our target."
