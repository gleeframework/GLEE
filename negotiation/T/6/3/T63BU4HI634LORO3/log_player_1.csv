Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value and potential. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is a good deal for you, Alice. It surpasses your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob dropping his offer further in later rounds."
