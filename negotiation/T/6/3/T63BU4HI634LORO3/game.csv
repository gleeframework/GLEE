"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value and potential. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still reflects the inherent worth and potential I believe this product holds.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. Can we meet at this price?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
