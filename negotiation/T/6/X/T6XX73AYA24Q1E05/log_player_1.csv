"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $125.  It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $100. I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob further, as there's still room for improvement.  If I can't get a better offer from him, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? That's a fair price for both of us, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $97.50 is still below my minimum of $100.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him closer to my desired price. If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $102.50? That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my minimum. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 102.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $97.50 is a fair offer. Can we meet at $99? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to keep it under $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer of $99 is very close to my minimum, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and he doesn't seem to be budging much.  I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk him rejecting my next offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk getting nothing or a lower price from Bob."
