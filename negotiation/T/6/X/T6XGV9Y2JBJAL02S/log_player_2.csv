Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer. We believe in maintaining a fair market value for our assets. To continue our discussion, I am proposing a revised price of $1,300,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to its value to you, while ensuring we maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.

Alice has come down a bit, but her new offer is still higher than where you'd like to be. You're still within your budget, and there's room to negotiate further without risking losing the deal entirely."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to consider your proposal. After careful consideration, I am proposing a revised price of $1,290,000 for the product. This offer reflects a fair compromise between our positions. I hope this aligns with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreeable solution.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. At $1,290,000, you're very close to your ideal price and are still saving a substantial amount compared to John's offer.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away and you having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings at this point.  It's a good deal, and it's time to close it."
