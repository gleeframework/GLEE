Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** A large gap between your initial offer and Bob's perceived value can make negotiation difficult. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. Good luck with the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
