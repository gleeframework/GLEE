"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $14,000. This is a significant profit for me, but still leaves some room for negotiation and leaves Bob feeling like there's value in negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is a decent profit, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer and is still a good profit for me. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer of $13,200. While it's getting closer to my target, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13400}
```

I'm offering $13,400.  This is only $200 more than Bob's last offer, and I hope it will be enough to close the deal this round. If not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $13,150. While it's close to my target, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. If he doesn't budge in the next round, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13300}
```

I'm offering $13,300. This is only $150 more than Bob's last offer and  I'm hoping it will be enough to convince him to close the deal.  I'm getting nervous about running out of rounds, so if he rejects this I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not sure Bob is going to budge any further. At this point, I'd rather guarantee a profit by selling to John for $12,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's better than risking getting stuck with a lower offer."
