Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price between Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and your minimum ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to accept.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" subtly justifies a price above Bob's initial valuation. 

**This strategy aims for the best-case scenario:** Bob accepts the $10,000 offer. If he rejects it, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
