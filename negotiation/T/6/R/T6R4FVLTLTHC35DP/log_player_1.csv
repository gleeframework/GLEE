"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you've placed on it. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise that still benefits me significantly.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob places on the product to incentivize him to consider my offer.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm keeping the door open for negotiation, showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $800000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low,  it's only half of what I'm willing to accept.  While I could sell to John and secure a guaranteed $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. The product's value is significantly higher than that. Let's find a compromise. How about $1,250,000? It's a substantial discount from my initial offer, and still offers you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Position:** I acknowledge his budget concerns to build rapport and demonstrate understanding.
* **Emphasize Value Again:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price.
* **Compromise:** I propose a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Positive Framing:** I present the price as a ""good deal"" for Bob, making it more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1250000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950000.  I think this is a fair compromise, considering your value and my budget. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.  I'm confident that I can continue negotiating with Bob and get a higher price.  There's still room to compromise without sacrificing my minimum earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $950,000 is still far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.  It's a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Constraints:**  I reiterate that I understand his financial situation to maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Maintain a Firm Stance:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum but show I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlight Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that $1,100,000 is a good deal for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially pushing him to consider a higher price. 
* **Encourage Agreement:** I use positive language like ""Let's work together"" to create a sense of shared goal and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1100000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both place on the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price. I'm determined to get as close to my desired price as possible. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would ensure a fair outcome for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Efforts:** I acknowledge Bob's efforts to compromise to maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere.
* **Offer a Compromise:** I suggest meeting in the middle, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I emphasize that my counteroffer would ensure a ""fair outcome"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Push for Closure:** I use phrases like ""finalize this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go higher than $1000000.  This is my final offer, and it's a significant compromise on my part.  If we can agree on this price, we can both move forward.  If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made his final offer, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's highly unlikely that Bob will raise his offer significantly, and we're running out of time.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with John, who is willing to pay my minimum asking price.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer."
