"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you've placed on it. Let's talk!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $800000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me. The product's value is significantly higher than that. Let's find a compromise. How about $1250000? It's a substantial discount from my initial offer, and still offers you a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1250000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950000.  I think this is a fair compromise, considering your value and my budget. Let's make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $950000 is still far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.  It's a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1100000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both place on the product. Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This would ensure a fair outcome for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go higher than $1000000.  This is my final offer, and it's a significant compromise on my part.  If we can agree on this price, we can both move forward.  If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
