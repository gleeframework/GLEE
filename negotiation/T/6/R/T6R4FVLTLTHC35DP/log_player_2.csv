"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you've placed on it. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  There's no way I'm going to accept that. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me. The product's value is significantly higher than that. Let's find a compromise. How about $1250000? It's a substantial discount from my initial offer, and still offers you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my budget. While it is a decrease from her initial offer, it's still too high. I will continue to negotiate with Alice to try to get a lower price, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,250,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  I think this is a fair compromise, considering your value and my budget. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $950000 is still far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.  It's a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I'm still hopeful that I can get Alice to come down further.  I'll continue to negotiate, keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both place on the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This would ensure a fair outcome for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm getting closer to my maximum budget, but I'm not willing to pay more than $1,000,000 at this point.  I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiations to see if I can get Alice to come down further.  However, I'm getting close to buying from John as a backup option."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go higher than $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a significant compromise on my part.
