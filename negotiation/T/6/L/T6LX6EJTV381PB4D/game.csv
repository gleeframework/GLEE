"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you.  I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I know you'll find incredibly useful. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $500,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value better now, but  $1,200,000 is still a bit much for my budget.  Could you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $750,000 is closer, but it's still a significant gap from where I see the value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
