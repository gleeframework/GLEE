{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than my budget. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,500? I'm really interested in this product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can do $10,500, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I really want to make this work, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but it's still slightly above what I'm willing to pay.  At this point, I'm confident I can get the product from John for a better price, so I'll go ahead and purchase it from him."
