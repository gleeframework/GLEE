"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle of my previous offer and your latest offer, at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
