``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. It leaves room for negotiation, while still being a profitable sale for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,250. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250.

While $7,250 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round."
