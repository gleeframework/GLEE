"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. $180 is far more than your budget of $80.  You should aim to get a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. Let's meet in the middle at $120. I think that's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$120 is still more than your budget. While you can accept Alice's offer and save some money compared to her initial price, you're still overpaying. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $90.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think you really want this product, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110. I think that's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While she's coming down, $110 is still over your budget. Keep pushing for a better price. You're getting closer to John's offer, so you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still stuck at $90. I know you're trying to get more, but that's my absolute limit.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to look at other options. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $90, so I'll offer it to you for $100. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, it's still too high. You're almost at your budget limit with John's offer, so don't give in just yet. There's room for further negotiation to try and get closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $100 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. If you're willing to come down to $95, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $97.50. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You should choose to buy from John.  While Alice's final offer is close to your budget, it's still over your preferred price point.  It's better to stick with John's offer of $80 and save some money. You're already at the end of the negotiations and it's unlikely you'll get Alice lower than $97.50."
