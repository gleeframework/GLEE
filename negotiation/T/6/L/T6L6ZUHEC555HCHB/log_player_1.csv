"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,600,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I believe we can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, time is running out. Accepting Bob's offer for $1,660,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of a lower offer or having to sell to John for $1,200,000."
