"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more in the range of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $750,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price still leaves room for a good profit for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",825000.0,Alice,3,
