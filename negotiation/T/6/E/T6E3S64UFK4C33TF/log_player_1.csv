Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 
Explanation:

* **Strategy:**  The goal is to maximize profit, knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $100. Offering a price slightly below your minimum ($100) creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. 
* **Pricing:** $99 is a good starting point. It's a tempting offer for Bob, as it's significantly less than his perceived value ($80), and it nets you a good profit.
* **Messaging:** The message aims to pique Bob's interest without revealing you have another buyer. The ""limited time"" element encourages a quicker decision."
