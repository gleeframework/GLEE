"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still too high for me. Could you consider $12,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
