"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is far too high.  It's better to reject the offer and see if a counteroffer can be negotiated.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as Bob still has 9 rounds to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows Bob's willingness to bargain.  It's important to leave some room for compromise, as Alice is unlikely to immediately accept such a low price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. There's still time to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he is willing to negotiate but still pushing for a lower price. This counteroffer is closer to his maximum budget, and it leaves room for Alice to make a concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. While it's getting closer, Bob is only $1,500 away from his target. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating. There's still time to potentially get a better price. Buying from John would be a worse outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making his final offer. He is willing to pay his maximum budget of $15,000 for the product. It's likely that Alice will accept this offer, as it's only $1,500 below her previous offer.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob should consider buying from John as there is only a limited number of rounds left."
