"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious investment if the product is as great as you say it is. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is as low as I can go while still ensuring I meet my minimum requirements. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
