"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  $9,000 is still more than the product is worth to him. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to Alice's minimum value as possible.  $7,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation and hopefully pushes Alice closer to her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the initial one, but it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob should continue to try to negotiate a lower price. He has several rounds left, so there's no need to rush into accepting a deal that's not in his favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. $8,000 is the midpoint between Alice's previous offer and Bob's last counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and might push Alice to accept the deal, as it's close to her minimum value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the previous one, it's still above Bob's target price. With several rounds left, Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal.  There's no urgency to accept this offer yet, as Bob can still buy the product from John for $12,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise but still trying to stay within his budget. This offer is a good compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This might encourage Alice to accept, especially since it's closer to her minimum value than to Bob's maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price. While the rounds are getting fewer, there's no need to rush into accepting a deal that's not in his favor. Bob still has a couple more rounds to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's likely acceptable price point. This offer is a good middle ground between the last two offers. It shows Bob's willingness to be flexible but also maintains his desire to get the best deal possible. With limited rounds left, this might push Alice to accept, especially if she doesn't want to risk Bob going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than previous rounds, it's still not within Bob's target price range. With only one round remaining, Bob should try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John. It's likely Alice will be more willing to compromise in the final round, knowing that Bob has an alternative option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final chance to secure a deal with Alice.  $8,900 is a significant increase from his previous offer but is still well below Alice's initial offers and within Bob's budget. This offer is a final attempt to meet Alice halfway, leaving little room for further negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob has no choice but to buy from John. This increases the pressure on Alice to accept, especially since it's a more favorable deal than buying from John."
