# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You can save money by counter-offering and potentially reaching a better price. You have room to negotiate as you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and Alice's bottom line is likely around $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is still a little too low for me.  Given the product's potential value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.  Let's see if we can make this work.

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,100,000 is still higher than your ideal price. There's room to negotiate further, potentially reaching a price closer to your $950,000 offer."
