"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price, even if it means negotiating with Alice. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is not a good option since he can potentially get it for less."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm willing to move a bit on price, how about we settle at $1,350,000? This reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At this point, it's the best deal available to him.  Buying from John would be more expensive, and while he could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee that she'll accept a further counteroffer."
