Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he rejects the offer, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm going to try and squeeze a bit more out of him. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
