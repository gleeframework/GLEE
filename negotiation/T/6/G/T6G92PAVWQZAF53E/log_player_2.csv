Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so it's better to take that guaranteed deal than risk Alice not going any lower."
