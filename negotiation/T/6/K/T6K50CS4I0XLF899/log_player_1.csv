Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is more than my minimum, I think I can do better.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $8,500? That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,750 is still below what I consider fair for the value of the product to me. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also mindful of the time limit and John's offer.  I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $7,750 isn't quite enough. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $8,250.  This is the best I can do, and I hope you see the value it represents for you."", ""product_price"": 8250}
