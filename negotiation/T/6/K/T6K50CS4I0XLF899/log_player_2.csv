Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?

Round 2

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $8,500? That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $7,750 isn't quite enough. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $8,250.  This is the best I can do, and I hope you see the value it represents for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down considerably and is now offering the product for $8,250. This is a good deal considering John's price is $10,000 and Alice's initial offer was $9,500.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result, and there's a risk Alice could raise her price or I run out of rounds."
