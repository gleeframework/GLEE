"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $10,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a high starting price, but still below the value Bob places on the product. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I want to keep the conversation friendly and open to a deal. 
* **Direct offer:** I'm not beating around the bush, I'm offering a price right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** I'm aiming for at least $8,000, so $9,000 is closer but still not enough.
* **There's room for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a backup:** While John offers a guaranteed $8,000, I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $9,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and proposing a middle ground. 
* **Fairness emphasis:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario, highlighting that it benefits both of us. 
* **Staying above minimum:** $9,500 is still above my minimum of $8,000, and leaves room for potential negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $9,200 is closer to my minimum, I'm still only $200 away from my target.  
* **More negotiation room:**  I still have 6 rounds left, which is more than enough time to potentially squeeze out an extra few hundred dollars from Bob.
* **Risking losing Bob:**  While I'm close to my minimum, I'm not desperate yet.  I believe I can get a better offer from Bob, and I want to keep the possibility of a higher deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,300. That's just a small adjustment, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Adjustment:** I'm only moving up by $100, showing flexibility but not giving away too much.
* **Compromise Emphasis:**  I reiterate the idea of a compromise, making it seem like the final step before a deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm remaining enthusiastic and encouraging a positive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, but that's my absolute limit. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer is only $50 below my target of $9,300.
* **Limited negotiation time:**  We're down to 4 rounds, and there's a risk that Bob might walk away or counteroffer with an even lower price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if this deal falls through.  

Since Bob seems firm on his offer, I'm taking it to secure a good deal and avoid risking a lower offer or a stalemate."
