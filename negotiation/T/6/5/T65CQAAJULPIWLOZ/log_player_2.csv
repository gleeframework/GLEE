# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer.**  While you'd ideally get it for less, $9,500 is still within your budget and saves you $500 compared to buying from John. 
* **It's a good deal for you.**  You're getting the product for a price below your maximum, and Alice is also getting a decent profit."
