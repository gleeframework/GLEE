{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you some wiggle room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It shows that you're willing to negotiate, but you're also not giving away the product for free. 

Remember, the goal is to get the highest price possible while still ensuring a sale.  Keep track of Bob's counteroffers and adjust your strategy accordingly.  If he's not willing to come up to a price you're comfortable with, you can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's far below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. I'm offering $9,000, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I want to make a sale, Bob's offer of $9,000 is simply too low. I'm going to make one more counteroffer and see if we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the price John is offering, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I've already made several concessions and I don't want to risk lowering my price further.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
