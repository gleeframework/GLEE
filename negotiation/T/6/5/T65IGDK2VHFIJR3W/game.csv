"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. I'm offering $9,000, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the price John is offering, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,6,
