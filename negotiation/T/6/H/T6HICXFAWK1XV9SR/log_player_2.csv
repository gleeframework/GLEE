"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($9,000) than Alice's initial price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  While the message is brief, it acknowledges Alice's offer and provides a simple reason for the counteroffer (""a bit too high"").
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is crucial for successful negotiations. 
 
My goal is to see if Alice is willing to come down significantly in price. If not, I can always increase my offer in subsequent rounds or buy from John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but there's still a potential $500 saving. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about $9,750? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($10,500) and my previous offer ($9,000). It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Direct but Respectful:**  The message directly proposes a price while maintaining a polite tone.
* **Last Attempt:**  This counteroffer is close enough to John's price ($10,000) that if Alice rejects it, I'll likely buy from John to avoid further back-and-forth."
