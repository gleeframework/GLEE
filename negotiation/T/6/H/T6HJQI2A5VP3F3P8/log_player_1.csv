Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm asking $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product.  This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $12,500.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $12,000 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate as I'm not going to get a better offer from him.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
