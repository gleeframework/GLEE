"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000? This gives you a good deal and allows me to get a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $10,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one last adjustment. How about we settle on $10,900?  This would allow me to get closer to my desired price, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",10900.0,Alice,5,
