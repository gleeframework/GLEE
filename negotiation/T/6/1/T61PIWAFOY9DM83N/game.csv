"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.",15500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $16,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15,500.  I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $15,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
