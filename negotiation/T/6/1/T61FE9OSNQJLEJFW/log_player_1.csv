{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for potential negotiation. It also includes a friendly and positive message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11,000. How about we try $11,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,200 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold. I'm not comfortable continuing to negotiate downwards.  I'll sell to John for $12,000.  It's a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum."
