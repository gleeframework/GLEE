"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a price of $1500000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I believe its value will exceed this price in the long run. Please let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential. Let me know if you're open to negotiating at that level.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This price still reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to offer $1000000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in the product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
