Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:** By offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, we can gauge how interested he is. If he accepts immediately, we know we could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, we can always come down in price or move on to John.
* **Guaranteed Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net. It means we're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
