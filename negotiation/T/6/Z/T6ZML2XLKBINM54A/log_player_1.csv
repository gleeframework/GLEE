"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to set a strong starting point to maximize my potential profit. I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to leave room for me to make concessions in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I won't accept anything below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident I can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000.  This is still a significant amount for Bob, but it's a more realistic price point than my initial offer. I believe this price demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value. If Bob rejects, I'm ready to continue lowering the price gradually, but I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I still have several rounds left, and I'm determined to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering $1,600,000.  This is a further concession from my previous offer, and it's getting close to John's offer. However, I'm still holding out hope that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects, I will seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not confident I can get a higher price from him.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will be fruitful. Therefore, I'm going to accept John's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a safe and reliable option that guarantees I'll reach my minimum goal."
