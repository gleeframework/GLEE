"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000.  This product is valuable, but it needs to fit within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This price is still within Alice's acceptable range (she'd prefer $1,200,000). It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to budge.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Bob still has room to increase his offer if necessary, but this first counteroffer establishes a strong starting position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While there's a chance Bob might get a slightly better deal by continuing to negotiate, there's also a risk that Alice will walk away or become less willing to compromise. 
* **Time is Money:**  Each round of negotiation takes time, and Bob has a limited number of rounds.  Accepting this offer secures a good price while avoiding potential delays and uncertainty."
