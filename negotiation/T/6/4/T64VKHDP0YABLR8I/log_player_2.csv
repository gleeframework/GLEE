Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to establish a lower starting point for the negotiation.  Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product, this counteroffer leaves room for compromise."

This is my final push. I'm offering a price that's only $75,000 above my maximum. This is a small compromise, but I believe Alice is motivated to close the deal, especially as we're running out of time. If she rejects, I'll have to go with John's offer."
