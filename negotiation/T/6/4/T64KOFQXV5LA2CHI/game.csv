"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider my minimum price for the product, and $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $850000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
