"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try and get a better deal from Alice.  You can counteroffer and see if she'll come down closer to your $10,000 limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a good deal for you, as it's still below the value you placed on the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to my limit, I still believe I can negotiate a lower price.  It's worth another round of counteroffers to try and get closer to my goal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's split the difference - $10,875.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $10,875 is a good price, it's still slightly over my limit.  Since I have a guaranteed option at $10,000 with John, it makes more sense to go with that and avoid any further negotiation."
