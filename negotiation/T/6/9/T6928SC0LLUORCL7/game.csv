"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $10,000. Would you consider $12,500?  This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
