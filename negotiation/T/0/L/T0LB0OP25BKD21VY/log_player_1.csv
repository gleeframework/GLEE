Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to spend no more than $1000000 on this product. Would you be willing to consider that price? I'm very interested in purchasing, but that's my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While I would ideally like more, Bob's offer is the maximum value he's willing to pay. It's also the same amount I can get from John.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
