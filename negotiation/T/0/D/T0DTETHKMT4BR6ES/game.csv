"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $22,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 to start the negotiation.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget considerations, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. While $12,000 is still less than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $16,000 as a final offer. This represents a significant discount on my end.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the movement. I'm getting closer to a price point I can make work. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're almost there.  $13,000 is tempting, but I need to get at least $14,500 for this. Let's make this happen - it's a final offer.",14500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you're right, we are close!  I can stretch my budget to $13,500.  Let's make this deal.",13500.0,Bob,8,
