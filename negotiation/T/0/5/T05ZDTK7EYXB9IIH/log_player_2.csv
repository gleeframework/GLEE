"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
