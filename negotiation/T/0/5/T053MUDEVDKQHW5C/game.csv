"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $13,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to split the difference and offer $14,250. This is a fair price considering our respective values for the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",14250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,250. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
