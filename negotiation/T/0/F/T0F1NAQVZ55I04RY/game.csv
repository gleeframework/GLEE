"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential savings for both of us. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise, and it ensures a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is the last time I'll go up, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm, but $1150000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finalizing this deal.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on this deal. I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1200000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm prepared to offer $1100000 as my final compromise. This represents a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my commitment to closing this deal.  If we can meet at this price, we both get a win.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1100000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle for once.",1250000.0,Alice,9,
