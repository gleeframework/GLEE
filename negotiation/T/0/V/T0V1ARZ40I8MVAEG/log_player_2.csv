"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$6,500 is a good price, but there's room to negotiate and potentially save more. It's too early to buy from John, as there's a chance Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $1,500. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, while still being within a reasonable range. If she rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer in the next round based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only lowered the price by $500, which isn't a significant enough decrease to justify accepting.  I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price, so I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm going to meet her halfway this time.  Offering $5,500 shows a willingness to compromise, but also maintains my desire for a lower price. If she rejects, I'll consider a slightly higher offer next round, but I'm still confident I can get the product for less than $6,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but she's still too high. I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal. It's too early to buy from John, as I believe there's more room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting closer to Alice's price, but I'm still pushing for a lower price.  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to meet her halfway. If she rejects, I'll consider raising my offer slightly, but I'm not willing to go much higher.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal than what John is offering."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's price is getting closer, I'm still determined to get a better deal. It's worth a few more rounds of negotiation before considering John's offer.  I'm confident I can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my offer to $6,000.  Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $6,300, and I'm running out of time. This offer is a compromise, and if she rejects, I might have to consider John's offer.  However, I'm hoping that Alice will accept, as this would be a good deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Alice is not budging.  While $6,400 is still a good deal, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk missing out on the product altogether.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $12,000."
