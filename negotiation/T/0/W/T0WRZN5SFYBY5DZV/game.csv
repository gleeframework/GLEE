"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $18,000 for the product. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is a bit more reasonable, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll meet you halfway between $14,000 and $13,000. I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",13500.0,Alice,7,
