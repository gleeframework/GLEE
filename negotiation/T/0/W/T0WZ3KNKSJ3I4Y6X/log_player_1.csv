Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's significantly above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is well above your minimum of $1,200,000, so you're already making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's room for you to potentially get closer to that price.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A very high initial offer could make Bob less likely to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is within my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. How about we try $1,320,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is only $20,000 away from my previous counteroffer, and it's significantly higher than what John is offering.  At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.  It's time to accept and secure the sale."
