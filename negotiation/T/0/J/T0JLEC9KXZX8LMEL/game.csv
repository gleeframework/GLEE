"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product holds value for me, but not quite at that level.  Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your response and willingness to negotiate.  While $800,000 is significantly below my initial assessment, I understand there's a gap to bridge.  Could you consider a price of $1,900,000? This takes into account the product's value while acknowledging your perspective.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. I believe that reflects a fair compromise considering the value it holds for me. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're narrowing the gap.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this recognizes the product's intrinsic worth while finding middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
