Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed price. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to a satisfactory number quickly. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the minimum value for the product without further negotiation."
