Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is a strong opening position, as it leaves room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of earning as much as possible.
* **Strategic Reasoning:**  I don't know Bob's valuation, so I'm aiming for a price that's above my minimum but leaves room for compromise.
* **Plan B:** The knowledge of John's offer at $12,000 acts as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John and guarantee a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Achieved:** $15,000 is within my desired range, but there's still room to potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While $15,000 is a good deal,  I'm not overly eager to close the deal at this stage. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my initial ask of $18,000.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 provides me with a solid fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise &  Increase:**  This counteroffer reflects a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.  The $16,500 price point is a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's offer, suggesting a desire to find common ground.
* **Value Signal:** This counteroffer signals to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal but also that I believe the product is worth more than $15,000. 
* **Balance Risk & Reward:**  This strategy balances the risk of losing a sale with the potential reward of securing a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  I am still aware of John's offer and can leverage it as a safety net if negotiations fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is significantly lower than my desired price point. Further negotiation at this stage is unlikely to yield a more favorable result.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially missing out on other opportunities.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer of $12,000 guarantees a profit and provides a quick and reliable way to close the deal.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While I would have preferred to sell for a higher price, accepting John's offer is the best option in this scenario, minimizing potential losses and ensuring a successful outcome."
