"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. How about we meet at $7,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down slightly to $8,200, which I believe is a very fair compromise.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,6,
