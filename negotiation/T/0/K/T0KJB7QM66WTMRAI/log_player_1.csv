"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a higher price than $800,000, but I'm also aware of the value I have with John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get more. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, especially since he's shown interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $975,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not giving up on my initial price range. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation without jeopardizing my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable accepting anything below $950,000 at this point. I'm still confident I can get a better deal, and I have the option of selling to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm sticking to my previous offer of $950,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if Bob will come around. If he doesn't, I can always fall back to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and with only four rounds left, I'm not confident I can get him to budge.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that for the chance of a slightly higher offer from Bob."
