"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's also a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
