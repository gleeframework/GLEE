"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better price than John's offer, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $1,350,000 which is only $50,000 more than your target of $1,300,000. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be tedious and may not result in a significantly lower price. Accepting her offer is the most strategic move."
