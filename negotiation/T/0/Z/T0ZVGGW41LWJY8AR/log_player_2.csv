# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire this exceptional product, but I need to be upfront with you - I'm looking to sell it for $1200000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident will bring you immense value. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's offer.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, there is no reason to buy from Alice.  There's no indication that Alice's product is any better or different than John's, so Bob should simply buy from John."
