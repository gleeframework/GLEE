{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value of $12,000 but leaves some room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product while leaving room for him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get closer to your desired price of $14,000.  You can counter with a slightly lower offer to see if you can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
