"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't afford it at $18,000. Could we perhaps negotiate down to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $15,000 is a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I still feel that $16,500 is a bit high for me. Would it be possible to lower it to $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $14,000 is still a significant drop. How about we settle at $15,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,
