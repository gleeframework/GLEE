Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $9,000, so I'll offer you a price of $8,500. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,750. I can do $8,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice has met her own valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. Accepting the $8,000 offer ensures Bob gets a good deal without risking the negotiation falling through."
