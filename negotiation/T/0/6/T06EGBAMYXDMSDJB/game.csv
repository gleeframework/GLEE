"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I've done extensive research, and similar products have commanded much higher prices in the market. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and provides a fair deal for both of us. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the unique value this product offers. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential returns you'll gain from this acquisition.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $975,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
