"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $13000?  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well above what the product is worth to you.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $13000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500 to show you I'm serious about making a deal. This still offers you a great value, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $13250?  This would be a good compromise, and I'm sure you'd still make a decent profit.",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13250 is still below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13375. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. What do you think?",13375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13375 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really close to my budget limit, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. How about $13125?  This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we need from this deal. ",13125.0,Bob,6,
