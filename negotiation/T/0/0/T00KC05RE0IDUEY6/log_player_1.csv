Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but lower than your minimum desired price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing you to earn a good profit. 

If Bob rejects, you can then sell to John for $15,000."
