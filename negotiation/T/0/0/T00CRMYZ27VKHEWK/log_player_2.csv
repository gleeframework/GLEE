You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not a good deal to accept Alice's offer. $12,000 is far above the maximum price Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, $7,500 is too low for me. Could you do $10,000?

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  There's room for further negotiation. Bob should try to get closer to his $8,000 limit."
