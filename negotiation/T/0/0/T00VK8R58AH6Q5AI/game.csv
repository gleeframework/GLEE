"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  This gives us both a fair price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  $110 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $115.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure about $115. I'd be willing to pay $112 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?,112.0,Bob,6,
