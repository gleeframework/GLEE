"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. My initial offer is $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've already discussed. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the compromise. However, my budget is quite strict. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $13,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $12,500. That's stretching my budget, but I recognize the value of the product. What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $12,500. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $13,200? This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise considering the value of the product.",13200.0,Alice,7,
