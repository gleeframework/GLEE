"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset for a price that's significantly below its worth to you, and I get a great price for my product. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $950,000 is the absolute lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me.  This is a valuable product, and I believe it's worth every penny of my counteroffer. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $925,000? That's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",925000.0,Bob,4,
