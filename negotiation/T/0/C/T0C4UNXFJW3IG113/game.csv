"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still reflects the significant value the product holds for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, but $980,000 still falls short of my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my acceptable range. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
