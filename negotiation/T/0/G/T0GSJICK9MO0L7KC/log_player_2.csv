"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's value of $10,000. Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point, leaving some room for Alice to counter while still being a significant saving for Bob compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob another chance to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to gradually increase his offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget.  $10,750 is a compromise, showing Bob's willingness to move from his initial $10,500 offer, but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,400 is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but it's still too high.  At this point, Bob has already made two counteroffers and is likely nearing the limit of how much he's willing to negotiate.  It's time to cut his losses and buy from John for $12,000, ensuring he gets the product while minimizing the risk of further negotiation leading to a worse outcome."
