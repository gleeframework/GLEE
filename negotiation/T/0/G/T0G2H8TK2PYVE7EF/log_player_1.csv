Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 13,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's still a decent offer. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since I don't want to sell the product for less than $12,000, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer. I'll increase the price slightly to try to get closer to my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
{""counteroffer"": 12,800}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 12,800}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum price, I'll reject his offer and send another counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to my minimum price by increasing the price slightly.

Since Bob's offer is just $100 below my minimum price, I'll reject his offer and decide to sell the product to John for $12,000. I don't want to risk going any lower than that.
