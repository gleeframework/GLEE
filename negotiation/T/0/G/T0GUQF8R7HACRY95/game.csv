"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12500. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you at $11800. That's the highest I'm comfortable going. Can you consider that?",11800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. I can go down to $12200.  This is a really fair price, considering the product's worth, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know what you think.",12200.0,Alice,5,
