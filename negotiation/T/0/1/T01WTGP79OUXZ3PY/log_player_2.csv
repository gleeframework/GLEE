"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $150.** While she claims it's a great deal for you, it's not.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price.** 
* **Buying from John is not an ideal option yet, as you can potentially get a better price from Alice.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a lower price:**  I'm offering $130, which is $10 less than Alice's offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but am also trying to get a better price.
* **Be polite and reasonable:** The message is friendly and explains my reasoning. I'm not trying to be aggressive, just making a fair counteroffer.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** $130 is still above Alice's minimum value of $120, so there's room for her to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit low for me.  How about $135? It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget:**  $135 is within my maximum price of $150.
* **It's a fair compromise:** Alice has come down from her initial price, and I've moved up from my counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a worse option:**  John's price is $15, more expensive than Alice's current offer. 
* **There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds:**  Negotiations can be unpredictable, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy the product at a reasonable price."
