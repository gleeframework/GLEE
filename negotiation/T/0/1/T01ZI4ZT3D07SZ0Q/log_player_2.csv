Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for us to both benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,600,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my target price of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can push for a lower price and still secure a deal.  I'm not ready to go to John yet, as I might be able to get a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,550,000? This price is reasonable for both of us, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
