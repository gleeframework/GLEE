"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for us to both benefit from this deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to try to get a better price from him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,600,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,550,000? This price is reasonable for both of us, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
