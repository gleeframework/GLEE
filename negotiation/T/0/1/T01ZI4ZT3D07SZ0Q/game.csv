"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for us to both benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,600,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know if you're interested.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,550,000? This price is reasonable for both of us, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
