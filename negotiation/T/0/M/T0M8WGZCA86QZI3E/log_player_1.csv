"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you as well. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
