"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate you considering me.  However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to buy it for $140.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there yet, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $155?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to come down another $5 and offer it to you for $150. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",150.0,Alice,5,
