"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've researched the product to have. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go higher than his perceived value of $1,200,000.  Selling to John guarantees you meet your minimum acceptable price without further risk or time spent negotiating."
