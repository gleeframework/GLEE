Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Calling it an ""exclusive opportunity"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you don't know much about Bob's negotiation style. If you knew he was very price-sensitive, you might adjust your approach.
* **Market Information:** This assumes you have no reason to believe someone other than Bob would pay more than $1,200,000.  If you suspected higher demand, you could push the price even further."
