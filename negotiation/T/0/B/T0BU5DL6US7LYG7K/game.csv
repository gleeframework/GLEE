"Alice,  $12000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $9500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $10000 and $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? This is still a great deal for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I can only offer $10500.  If you're open to that, I'm ready to move forward. ",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price between $10500 and $11000. How about we meet at $10750? This is still a great deal for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",10750.0,Alice,5,
