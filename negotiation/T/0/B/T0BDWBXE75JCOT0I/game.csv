"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm thinking of a price of $10000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $9500 for the product. It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9000. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $9500, so I'm proposing a price of $9250 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that balances our interests.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $9250, but I think I can only go up to $9200. I'm hoping we can meet there and finalize the deal.",9200.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not getting the price I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9200 and $9250, so I'm proposing a price of $9225 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget constraints.",9225.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your continued effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9150, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet there and finalize the deal.",9150.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9150 and $9200, so I'm proposing a price of $9175 for the product. However, I want to let you know that I'm starting to consider other options, including selling the product to a different buyer. I'd like to resolve this deal with you, but I need to think about my priorities.",9175.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go above $9000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $9000, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not comfortable with it. I'm not willing to go any higher, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",9000.0,Bob,10,
