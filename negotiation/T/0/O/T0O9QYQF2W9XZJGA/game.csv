"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying if you were willing to come down to $130. ",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, would you be open to that? ",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $152.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",152.5,Alice,5,
