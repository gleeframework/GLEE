# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this [product name] and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $100 is less than the product's worth to Alice, you know you can get it for a better price from John ($80)."
