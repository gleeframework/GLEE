Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""open to discussing a fair price"" signals to Bob that you're willing to negotiate, making him more likely to engage. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While there's a chance Bob might reject a $150 offer, you have a guaranteed $100 offer from John as a backup. It's worth taking a calculated risk to potentially earn more."
