"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something around $11,000. Would that be feasible for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  $13,500 is getting close, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be at $11,500.  Do you think that's something we could agree on?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. I think it's a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",12500.0,Alice,7,
