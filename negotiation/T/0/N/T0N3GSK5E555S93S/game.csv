"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is still a great deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $950000 is still too far below the value this product holds for you.  I'm willing to go down to $1050000.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer. $975000 is still below what I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to drop to $1025000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this happen!",1025000.0,Alice,7,
