"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer, but $10,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me. $11,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet at $11,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
