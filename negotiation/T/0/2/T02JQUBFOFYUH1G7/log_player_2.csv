"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $130 is a decent discount from Alice's value, it's still significantly higher than your $80 maximum and what John offers. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too steep for my budget. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer anchors the negotiation much lower. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it leaves more room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the bargaining process.
* **Strategic Goal:**  The ultimate aim is to get Alice closer to your $80 maximum, or at least significantly lower than the $130 initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $100 is still more than your ideal price and what John offers. It's worth negotiating a bit further to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $100 is getting closer, but I'm working with a tight budget. Could you do $75? That would really help me out."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your $80 limit. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning your budget adds a touch of personal reasoning, which might make Alice more receptive.
* **Leaving Room:**  By offering $75, you leave some space for potential further negotiation if Alice counters again, but you are also within a reasonable range of John's price."
