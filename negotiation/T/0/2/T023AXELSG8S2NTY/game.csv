"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great start, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great compromise, considering we're already close to the midpoint between our initial offers. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
