"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value is worth $1,500,000 to you, I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't accept a price as low as $1,800,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects the product's true worth and potential.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product, which is closer to my target price. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you mentioned earlier.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
