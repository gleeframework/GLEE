I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get closer to my desired price of $150. It's important to be ambitious but not too aggressive, as Bob may be unwilling to negotiate if the starting price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, it's below what the product is worth to me. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still maintaining a profit margin. I believe this price is reasonable, considering Bob's initial offer and my desire to sell the product for at least $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering the price again, but this time it's a smaller step. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise, while still being close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this final counteroffer will convince Bob to accept."
