"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $180 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $80. It makes more sense for Bob to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  While $130 is closer, it's still not a good deal for Bob. He can still get the product from John for a lower price. It's better for Bob to continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Since John is willing to sell the product for $80, it's more financially beneficial for Bob to buy from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point, as the risk of getting a worse deal than John's offer is too high."
