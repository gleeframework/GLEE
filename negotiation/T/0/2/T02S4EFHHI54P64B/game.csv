"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit low for me. I can meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I think it's the best deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
