Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as high as $9,600. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $10,500. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  You've negotiated well, but John's offer is your best bet to stay within your budget."
