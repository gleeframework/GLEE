"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value that I'm confident translates to your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
