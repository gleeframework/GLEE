"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob more amenable to a price that's ultimately closer to your desired range.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, signaling to Bob that you're willing to move from your initial offer. 
* **Leaves Room for Movement:** This high starting point allows you significant room to negotiate down over the remaining rounds while still aiming for a final price well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John right now would mean settling for the absolute minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value that I'm confident translates to your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reject Low Offer Clearly:**  Clearly stating that $1,400,000 is unacceptable prevents anchoring at that low price point. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's ""exceptional value"" reinforces its worth beyond Bob's initial assessment.
* **Significant but Strategic Movement:**  Dropping to $1,900,000 shows flexibility while still aiming for a price well above your minimum. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:** This classic tactic suggests a spirit of compromise and can make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $1,600,000. This is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob might walk away or your offers could get closer to John's standing offer. Accepting now secures a solid profit."
