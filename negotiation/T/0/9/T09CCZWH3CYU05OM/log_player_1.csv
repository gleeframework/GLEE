Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm countering with $125. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, $115 is a decent compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $100. It seems like we're close to an agreement, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
