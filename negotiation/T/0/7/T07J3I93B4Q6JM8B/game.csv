"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is still a bit below my desired price. How about $8750? It's closer to your offer and a good compromise. Let's make this deal happen!",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $8750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8500.  It's a fair price, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $8600. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",8600.0,Alice,5,
