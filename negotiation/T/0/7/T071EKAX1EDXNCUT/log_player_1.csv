Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this first offer. However, it sets a strong initial position and gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer.  I believe I can convince Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous offer.  Since I'm not confident I can push him higher, and it's more than John's offer, I'll accept to avoid risking a longer negotiation."
