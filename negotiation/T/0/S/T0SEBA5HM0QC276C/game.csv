"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at $7750? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence. While $7750 is closer, it's still a bit below what I can accept. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $8250? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer. How about we meet at $7900? I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit to get this product, but I need to stay within my limits.",7900.0,Bob,6,
