"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's still a decent price for me. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $8500 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9250? This gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a decent profit.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $9250 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $9000? That's a good compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9100.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident that we can close the deal.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go to $8800.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",8800.0,Bob,6,
