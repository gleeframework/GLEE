"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000, so there's room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's initial counteroffer reflects his willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price below $10,000. He's offering a significant amount ($500 less than Alice's first offer), making it clear he's serious about finding a mutually beneficial price. This approach could prompt Alice to counter with a lower price or accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about $9,750? It's still a great deal for you and closer to where I need to be. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,750 is a good compromise.  Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000. This price is within Bob's budget and a significant discount from John's price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to save money and move forward with the purchase."
