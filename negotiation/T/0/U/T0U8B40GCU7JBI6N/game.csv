"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price is still fair considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're getting closer to my price. I'm still happy to negotiate, but $7,750 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? This way, we both come away with a good deal, and I can get the product into your hands quickly. Let's make this happen!",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $7,900. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there!  I understand your budget constraints, but $7,900 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,400. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen â€“ I'm confident you won't regret it!",8400.0,Alice,7,
