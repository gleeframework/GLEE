"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and I'm willing to make a concession to work with you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000? I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges the value while still working within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
