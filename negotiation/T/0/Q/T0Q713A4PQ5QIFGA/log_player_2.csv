"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity, and I'm pleased to offer it to you first. Given its value, I'm setting the initial price at $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above my budget. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This represents a fair compromise given its value to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,100,000 is considerably below my initial assessment of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,450,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm not willing to go above $1,100,000 at this point.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000. This would allow us to both close this deal fairly."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to move a bit closer to your price, but $1,200,000 is still too low. How about we settle on $1,325,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While $1,325,000 is still more than I initially hoped for, it's a reasonable compromise and avoids further negotiation.  I'm comfortable closing the deal at this price rather than risking another rejection and potentially having to buy from John at $1,000,000."
