"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us â€“ it's a fair price for you, and it's a good starting point for me. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would give you a good deal, and it's closer to my target price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $920,000. That's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product.",920000.0,Bob,4,
