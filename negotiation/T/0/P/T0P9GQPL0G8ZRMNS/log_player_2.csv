"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations. Given its value and potential impact, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $9,500. This is a special opportunity tailored for you, considering the high worth of the product to both of us. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a lower price."
