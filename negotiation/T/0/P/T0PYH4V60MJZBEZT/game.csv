"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $18,000. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a valuable item that's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, as it allows me to acquire something valuable while still staying within my means. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. It's a fair compromise that still allows me to get a good deal, while also giving you a great value for your money. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement, as it lets me acquire the product while still staying within my budget.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $12,000 is still a bit short of my target. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
