"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm looking for a price that's more in line with my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? This price still leaves you with a healthy profit and allows me to get closer to my asking price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,180,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1180000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,180,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,190,000? I'm willing to come down a bit more, but this is as far as I can go.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,190,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,165,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1165000.0,Bob,6,
