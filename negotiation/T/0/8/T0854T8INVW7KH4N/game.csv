"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $90 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? I'm willing to make a compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $76?",76.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $76. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $84? It's still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",84.0,Alice,5,
