Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of your product, $1050000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
