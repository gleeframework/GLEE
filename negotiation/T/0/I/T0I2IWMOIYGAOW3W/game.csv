"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be worth $8,000 to me at most. I'm willing to offer you $8,500 to make it worth your while.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $8,500 is significantly below what I can accept. Could you consider something closer to $18,000? I'm willing to be a little flexible to make this work for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $18,000 is still too high for my budget. I could potentially go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for coming back to me. I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To meet you halfway, I can drop my price to $15,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still recouping a fair value for the product.",15000.0,Alice,5,
