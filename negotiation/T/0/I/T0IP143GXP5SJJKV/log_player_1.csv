"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not offering the full $15,000, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially settle on a price we both find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value still high:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below the product's worth to him ($15,000). I can likely squeeze out more value.
* **Multiple rounds remaining:**  With 9 rounds left, I have ample time to negotiate and reach a more favorable price.
* **Testing the waters:** Rejecting this offer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and potentially push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal this round."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we finalize a deal in this round. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  $11,000 is still a good price for me, but leaves some room for Bob to make a final counteroffer if necessary."
