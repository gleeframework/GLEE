"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  the value of this product is truly exceptional, and  $1,800,000 is a fair reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the product's potential to deliver for you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that the product has exceptional value, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value and my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
