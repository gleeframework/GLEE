"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,900,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding common ground. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,600,000 is still pushing it too low. How about we settle this at $1,750,000? This offer reflects my strong desire to reach a mutually beneficial deal.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, as I mentioned earlier, or I can meet you halfway from your last offer, which would be $1,725,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts?",1725000.0,Bob,6,
