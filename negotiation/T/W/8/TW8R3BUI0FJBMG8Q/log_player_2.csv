Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above your target price of $8,000. You've already rejected her offer twice and countered with your own offers, and it's not clear if she'll continue to negotiate down further.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at your target price, it's best to take the safe option and buy from John."
