"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a steal! I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, you can likely get it for even less. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $120 offer, and $115 is still within your budget and a good deal compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and secure the product."
