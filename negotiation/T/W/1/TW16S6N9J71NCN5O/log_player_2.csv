Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15750} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm making a final push with a counteroffer of $15,750. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  It demonstrates my willingness to meet halfway while still staying within my budget.  With only a few rounds left, I need to strike a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding the risk of losing the opportunity."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close, but Alice is still holding out for a price higher than I'm comfortable with. With only a few rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating. I've reached a point where the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure the product at John's price and avoid the chance of a last-minute breakdown."
