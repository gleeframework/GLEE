Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small buffer for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($12,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't make a loss if Bob declines.

This strategy aims for a win-win situation: Bob gets a product he values at a price slightly below his perceived worth, and you secure a strong profit."
