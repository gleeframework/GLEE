{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $120 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a profit for you.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is slightly below your minimum ($120) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100), increasing the chance he might accept. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and enticing Bob to accept."
