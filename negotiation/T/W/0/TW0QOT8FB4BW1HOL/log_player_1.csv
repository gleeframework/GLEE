{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves some room for negotiation, but it's also above my minimum price of $12,000. I want to see if Bob is interested at this price before going lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is far below my minimum price of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. This might be a good middle ground to see if Bob is willing to meet us halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9500. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $11,250. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm splitting the difference between my last offer and his last offer, hoping to find a compromise that both of us can agree to. It's still above my minimum, but if he rejects this, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for the product. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm confident I can get a better price from John. It's time to move on and sell to John for $12,000."
