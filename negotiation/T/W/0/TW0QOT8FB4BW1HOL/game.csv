"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9500. Can we meet in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9500 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $11250. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for the product. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,
