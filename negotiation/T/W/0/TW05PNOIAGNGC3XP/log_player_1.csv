Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you don't immediately lose out. 

By starting with a higher offer, you create room for negotiation and increase the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, you can still aim for a higher amount. You're in a good negotiating position, and you can leverage John's offer as a safety net. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and push for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While you can technically continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's also a significant improvement from his previous offer, and it indicates his willingness to compromise.  Accepting his offer ensures you make a decent profit and avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might result in a lower price or even a failed deal."
