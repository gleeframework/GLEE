"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $950,000. I believe it's a significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  Please let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to anchor you to a high price ($950,000) and create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer. 
* Your maximum value for the product is $1,000,000, and you can always buy it from John at that price.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might:
    *  Force her to lower the price to avoid losing the sale.
    *  Still be able to purchase it from John for $1,000,000 if Alice doesn't budge.

It's a strategic risk, but potentially saves you a significant amount of money."
