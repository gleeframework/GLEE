"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price. It's worth negotiating to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a new price of $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000. While further negotiation is possible, it's not guaranteed to result in a lower price. Since Bob has a guaranteed option of buying the product from John for $10,000, it's more prudent to take the guaranteed deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
