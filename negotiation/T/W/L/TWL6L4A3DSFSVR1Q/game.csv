"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a new price of $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
