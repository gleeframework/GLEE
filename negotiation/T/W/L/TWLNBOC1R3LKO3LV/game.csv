"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep. While I recognize the product's value, I'm looking to pay a price closer to $900,000. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreeable compromise. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing money on the deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it's a price that I can comfortably afford. Let's work together to close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. Considering the value of the product to you and the fact that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and my previous offer of $1,025,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
