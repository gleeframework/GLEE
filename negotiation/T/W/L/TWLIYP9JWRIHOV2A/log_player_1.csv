Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000,  so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000). 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $12,000 aims for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a fallback option with John at $8,000, ensuring you don't lose money if Bob declines. 

This strategy balances ambition with a safety net, increasing your chances of a profitable outcome."
