{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. It also indicates that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not desperate.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept since it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with some counter-offers. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, however. I'll accept $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
