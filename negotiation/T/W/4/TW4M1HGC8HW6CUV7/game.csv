"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.
