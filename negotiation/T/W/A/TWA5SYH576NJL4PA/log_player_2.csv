{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can explore a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000  is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range of Bob's budget. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness in negotiating a fair price, while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to drive the price down further. There are still several rounds remaining, and Bob has a better chance of achieving his goal of saving money by rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to his goal of saving as much money as possible. This counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a slight increase from his previous offer, showing his willingness to compromise, but still significantly lower than Alice's offer. By sticking to his negotiation strategy, Bob increases the likelihood of securing a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price. While further negotiation is possible, it's becoming increasingly risky. With only 5 rounds remaining, the likelihood of securing a significantly lower price decreases.  

Accepting this offer guarantees a purchase within Bob's budget, and saves time and effort compared to further negotiations.  Additionally, Bob has a buffer of $375,000 before reaching his maximum price, providing some breathing room if unforeseen circumstances arise."
