"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $165. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",165.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! I understand that $140 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $155. It's a good balance between what I need and what you're willing to pay.",155.0,Alice,5,
