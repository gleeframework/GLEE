Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob is willing to pay the minimum I'm willing to accept, there's no reason to continue negotiating.  Accepting his offer ensures I get the best possible price."
