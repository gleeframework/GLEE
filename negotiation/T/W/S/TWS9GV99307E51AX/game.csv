"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. Considering the product's worth to me, I would like to propose a purchase price of $810000.",810000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $810000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $860000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a new price of $880000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope it's acceptable to you. Let's try to finalize the deal.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $880000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price. I'd rather sell the product to John for $800000 than compromise further. Let's finalize the deal or part ways.",880000.0,Alice,7,
