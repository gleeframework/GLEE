Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so I need to offer a price that's attractive but leaves me with a good profit margin.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a safety net with John who will buy the product for $150, so I don't need to go below that.

By offering the product at $145, I'm aiming for the highest possible price Bob might accept while still making a profit of $25 if he accepts."
