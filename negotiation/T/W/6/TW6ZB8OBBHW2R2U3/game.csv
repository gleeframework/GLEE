"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $700000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for such a unique item.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $750000.  How about we split the difference and go with $725000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $725000. However, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $735000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",735000.0,Alice,5,
