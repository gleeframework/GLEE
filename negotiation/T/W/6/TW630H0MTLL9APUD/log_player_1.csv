Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to be made (Bob's value - your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and represents a significant opportunity for you. "", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It highlights the product's value without explicitly mentioning Bob's perceived value. The language suggests careful consideration went into the price.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (enough to be appealing) while securing you a $150,000 profit.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is fluid. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can then decide to negotiate further or accept his offer if it meets your minimum requirement."
