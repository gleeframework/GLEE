Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth at least $100, and I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible. Since Bob values the product at $100, starting higher allows room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup ensures you won't go below $100, but aiming higher with Bob first is strategically sound. 
* **Psychology:** A slightly ambitious initial price can sometimes work in negotiations. Even if Bob counters, you're still likely to settle above your minimum."
