Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You're still leaving some room for potential negotiation while ensuring you get at least $11,000.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is friendly and straightforward, leaving no room for misinterpretation. 

By starting with this offer, you're setting the stage for a potentially successful negotiation. Remember, you can always adjust your approach based on Bob's response and the flow of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  You're still willing to negotiate, but selling to John for $12,000 is always a secure option.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer and attempt to find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your target.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway by lowering your price, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  You're still earning more than your absolute minimum, ensuring you're getting a fair deal.
* **It's clearly communicated:** Your message is polite but firm, and it restates your position while offering a concrete solution.

By making this counteroffer, you are keeping the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has consistently stuck to his $10,000 price point.  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely he'll budge.  Given that John is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's the most sensible option to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
