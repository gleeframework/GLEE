Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,250,000."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique"" and ""valuable"" nature, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Backup plan:** I'm secure knowing John will buy the product at my minimum price if Bob declines. This allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. How I proceed will depend on Bob's reaction and counter-offers. I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'll remain firm on a price that yields a significant profit."
