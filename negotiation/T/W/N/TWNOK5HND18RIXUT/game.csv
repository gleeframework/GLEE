"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1200000. I believe its value is far greater, and I'm confident you'll see the same. Let's discuss this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your position, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain from owning it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your financial constraints, but $950000 is still below the value I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $975000? It's a fair compromise and allows both of us to gain something from this transaction. Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $975000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",925000.0,Bob,6,
