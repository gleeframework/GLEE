"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $650,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $675,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a budget-friendly option, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $680,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",680000.0,Alice,5,
