Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price that allows me to earn more than my minimum threshold of $80 while still being potentially attractive to Bob, who values the product at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my desired minimum of $80. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, hoping to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $87 is above my minimum of $80 and also higher than John's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it seems like Bob is firm in his stance. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit."
