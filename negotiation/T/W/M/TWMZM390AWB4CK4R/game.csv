"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can meet you in the middle at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price. How about we settle at $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I still think I can get a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is as high as I'm willing to go, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I feel like we're close, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'd be happy to close the deal right now for $12,500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $12,500. I'm still confident that I can get a better price for the product. I'll meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,7,
