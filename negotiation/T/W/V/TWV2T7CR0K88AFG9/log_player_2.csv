{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $1,450,000 is still too high for your budget. You have a few more rounds to work with, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price. You've already shown a willingness to compromise, so it's reasonable to expect Alice to come down further.  The goal is to see if you can reach a price closer to your target of $800,000 or at least get closer to your limit before resorting to buying from John."
