"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm thinking of a price around $900,000. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's try to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I need to be sure I get a fair price for this product.  Let's split the difference and go with $975,000.  This would allow me to move forward with the sale and still be within my desired range. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than $925,000, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,7,
