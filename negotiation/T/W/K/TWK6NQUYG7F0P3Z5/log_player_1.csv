"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to try and get Bob interested. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $10,000, I have room to make concessions in later rounds if needed.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation unfolds. I'm prepared to accept $8,000 from John as a safety net, but I'm aiming for a higher price if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a better price.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my position and potentially push for a higher price.
* **Not Yet Desperate:**  While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell yet. I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer closer to his price, but still above my minimum. My goal is to find a compromise that is favorable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's the average of my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still above my minimum, giving me some leverage if he rejects.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects again, I'll be more aggressive in lowering the price, but I'll still try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still above my $8,000 floor. I'm not desperate yet and believe I can get a better price.
* **Pushing for More:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not willing to settle for his current price. It might encourage him to come up a bit more in the next round.
* **Remaining Strategic:**  By continuing the negotiation, I maintain control and can explore if we can find a more mutually beneficial price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum.  I'll also be mindful of the number of rounds remaining and the risk of losing the deal entirely.  If Bob rejects again, I might be more willing to accept his price or even start to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $9,200 is closer, it's still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $9,400.  This would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's current offer. This shows a clear willingness to find common ground and demonstrates a sincere desire to close the deal. 
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing the word ""finalize"" to subtly suggest that this is my last offer, prompting Bob to consider accepting.
* **Maintaining a Buffer:**  While I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price, I'm still above my minimum. This leaves some room for negotiation if Bob rejects again.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this offer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider my options:

* **Accept Bob's Offer:**  If he rejects again, but stays around $9,200, I might accept to avoid further negotiations. 
* **Move Towards John:** If his counteroffers drop significantly or I'm running out of rounds, I might be forced to accept John's offer of $8,000.
* **Negotiate More Aggressively:** If Bob's offers are consistently low, I may need to be more assertive in my counteroffers to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $9300 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, but it's still above the $8,000 I'd get from John. I'm not desperate to sell yet.
* **Pushing for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. By rejecting, I can keep the pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be cautious.  However, I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can close the deal at a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his current offer. I'll also emphasize the limited time remaining and the value of the product to encourage him to accept. If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider accepting his offer or selling to John, depending on how the negotiation is going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I'm very interested in making a deal with you, but $9,300 is still a bit low.  With only a few rounds left, I'm willing to come down to $9,350.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Emphasize Limited Time:** I'm highlighting the limited time remaining to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Slight Concession:** I'm making a small concession by coming down to $9,350. This shows flexibility and willingness to close the deal.
* **Finality:** I'm again suggesting finality (""finalize this deal quickly"") to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

This is a critical round. I'll be watching closely for Bob's response. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I'll need to decide quickly between accepting his offer, selling to John, or making one final, aggressive counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll offer $9250 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** Bob has clearly stated this is his final offer, and with only two rounds remaining, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high.
* **Close to Minimum:** While $9,250 isn't ideal, it's just $250 away from my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No Guarantee:** There's no guarantee that Bob will budge further, and I could end up selling to John for $8,000. 

**Conclusion:**

It's time to secure the deal. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option, as it guarantees a sale above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
