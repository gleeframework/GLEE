"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Alice,5,
