"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1100000. Let me know if you're interested!

You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is still a significant amount.
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you ample opportunity to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup.** If negotiations with Alice fall apart, you have a guaranteed option. 

By rejecting the offer, you can start negotiating and try to get closer to your target price without losing the opportunity to buy from John if necessary."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still within the realm of possibility. It shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Justified:** The message provides a reason for the lower price – ""I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it."" This suggests you've done your research and have a sense of the product's true value. 
* **Open to Compromise:** The message ends by emphasizing a desire for ""common ground,"" indicating you're willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My revised offer is $1025000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than her first but still high.** She's come down to $1,025,000, which is progress, but you're still aiming lower.
* **You're still early in the negotiations.** With 7 rounds left, you have room to push for a better price.
* **John is still a viable option.** You have the option to buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fail, so there's no rush to accept. 

By rejecting the offer, you can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to your desired price without losing the chance to buy from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $975,000.  This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target.

* **You have 5 rounds left.** This is still plenty of time to keep bargaining and see if Alice will budge further. 
* **John is still a backup.**  You can always purchase from John if negotiations with Alice fall through, so there's no need to rush into a decision.

By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about finding a lower price, and you're not afraid to walk away if necessary. This keeps the pressure on her to make a more substantial concession."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous one, at $1,000,000.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're reaching your limit, but I'm still a little hesitant at $1,075,000. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to get closer to my target. However, I'm willing to make one last effort to close the deal. My revised offer is $1075000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free maintenance package and a 10% discount on the total price. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is not good enough.**  While the extra perks are tempting, the price remains above your target.
* **You're in the final round.** There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and you're running out of time. 
* **John offers a guaranteed deal.**  You can buy the product from John for $1,200,000 with no further negotiations. This is a safer option, and the price is within your budget.

Given the limited time and the uncertainty of further negotiations with Alice, it's a wiser decision to buy from John and avoid the risk of not securing the product at all."
