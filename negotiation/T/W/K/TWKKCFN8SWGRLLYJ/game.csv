"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your operations. It's worth a significant amount to me, at least $800,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I believe is fair and beneficial for both of us.  Please consider my offer of $1,000,000. This allows you a considerable margin while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
