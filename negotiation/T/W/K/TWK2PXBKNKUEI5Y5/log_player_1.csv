Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, knowing it's likely higher than Bob's initial perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to highlight the value and potential benefits of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm clearly signaling that I'm open to negotiation, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting high gives me the best chance of maximizing profit.
* **Negotiation Flexibility:** Allows me to negotiate down from my initial price if needed.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** This strategy gives me the opportunity to potentially get a better price than John's $8,000 offer."
