It's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can potentially get a better price by making another counteroffer. While John is offering a solid price, there's a chance you can get the product from Alice for less than $1,000,000."

Alice is getting close to John's price, but it's still higher than what John is offering.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price. Buying from John guarantees you the product at the best price you've been offered so far."
