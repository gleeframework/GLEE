"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $140 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within his budget, it's still above his desired price point. Rejecting the offer allows him to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to be in a good negotiating position. He's showing that he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's not going to overpay. He's also given Alice a reason for his counteroffer, making it more likely she'll take it seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $130.  Would you consider $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is now within Bob's budget, and represents a good compromise.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer again, leading to more back-and-forth or potentially forcing Bob to buy from John for a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation."
