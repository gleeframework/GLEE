"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7,500.

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $7,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $7,400. It's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",7400.0,Alice,5,
