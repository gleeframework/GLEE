{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John.  It's better to counteroffer and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

Bob is trying to get the best price possible.  Since he knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John, he's offering a significantly lower price to Alice.  This is a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what he can get from John. There's no reason to pay more when a cheaper option is available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible. He's going up slightly from his previous offer, but it's still below what he can get from John. This shows Alice that he's willing to negotiate but is also serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice is coming down in price, but she's still not offering a price lower than what John is selling it for.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as John offers a guaranteed deal at a lower price."
