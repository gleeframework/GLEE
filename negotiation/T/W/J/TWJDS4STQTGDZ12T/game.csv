"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,5,
