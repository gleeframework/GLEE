"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. My starting price is $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation. I'm also framing the message in a positive way to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $120.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160 to make this work. Let me know if that's something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $160 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $140 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $145?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $145 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. How about $135?  That would be a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $135 is only slightly below my minimum, we're already in the sixth round, and the negotiation isn't getting me any closer to my desired price. To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $150."
