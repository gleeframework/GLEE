"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is considering its true worth and potential.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite a ways apart on price. While I recognize the value of the product, I need to be realistic about my budget. I can go up to $1,250,000. Hopefully, that's a step in the right direction.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for coming up on your offer. To be honest, I have another offer for $1,500,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need you to be closer to that number. How about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I understand you have another offer, but I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair deal considering the other offer and the fact that I'm saving you time and effort. ",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting close.  I appreciate you recognizing the value and being willing to negotiate. To be completely transparent, my other offer is for $1,500,000. To make this work for me, I'd need you to come up to $1,475,000. That's my final offer.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
