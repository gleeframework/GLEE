This is a good deal for you, Bob.  Here's why:

* **You're saving money:**  You're getting the product for $25,000 less than John's offer.
* **Alice is being firm:**  Her ""final offer"" and the fact she revealed her other offer suggests she won't go much lower. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Trying to negotiate further for a small potential saving isn't worth the risk of losing the deal to the other buyer."
