"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're looking for a product worth no more than $800,000 to you. Alice's offer of $900,000 is above your budget. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $900,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still above your ideal price of $800,000, but it's closer to your budget and a good compromise.  You're likely to save more time and effort by accepting her offer than by continuing to negotiate.  While you could try to counteroffer again, it's not guaranteed that Alice will accept a lower price.  It's a better strategy to accept the offer and secure the product."
