"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite low for this product considering its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $9,500 is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I've tried to be flexible, but to be honest, anything below $11,500 wouldn't be fair to me. That's my final offer â€“ I believe it reflects the true value of the product. ",11500.0,Alice,5,
