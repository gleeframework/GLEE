"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's offer of $10,000, but it's still above Bob's ideal price point.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $9,500 is a good price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point, but it's lower than her previous offer and closer to Bob's counteroffer.
* Accepting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product for a price that is better than John's offer, while still saving money compared to Alice's initial offer.
* Further negotiation may result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice rejecting the offer or the process taking longer."
