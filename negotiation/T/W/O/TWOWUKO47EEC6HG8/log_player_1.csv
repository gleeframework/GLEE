Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my highest possible price, knowing it's more than Bob is willing to pay. This sets the stage for negotiation. I'm confident in my product's value, and I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible.  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I also have the option of selling to John for my full asking price if Bob doesn't come close enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm to my value of the product. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm ready to walk away if he doesn't come closer to my desired price."
