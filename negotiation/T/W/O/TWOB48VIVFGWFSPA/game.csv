,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $950,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still not there. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the transaction today.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking we could go a bit higher than $900,000. I can offer it to you for $925,000. This is still a great price, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $925,000 is still above my limit.  Let's meet in the middle again at $912,500. This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $912,500. I can offer it to you for $915,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product.",915000.0,Alice,7,
