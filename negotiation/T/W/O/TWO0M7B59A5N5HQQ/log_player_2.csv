"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $700000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your target price of saving as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $675000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $675,000 is closer to my target price, and a good compromise. Accepting her offer saves me $125,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could potentially continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential gain from further bargaining."
