Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still making a significant profit. 
* **Urgency and Value:**  The message implies a slight discount and frames the offer as a special opportunity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John if Bob refuses, so there's no risk of losing money. 

By offering the product at $11,999, I am aiming to secure a deal that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price while still being appealing enough for Bob to consider."
