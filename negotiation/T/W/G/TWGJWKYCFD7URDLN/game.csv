"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500?  This price still reflects the value of the product, but allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we try $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $7500 is still a bit too low for me.  Since you're willing to move up from your initial offer, how about we try $8000? This is my absolute minimum, and it reflects the value of the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",8000.0,Alice,5,
