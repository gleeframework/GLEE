"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  That's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering your value for it."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your constraints, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price of $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $11,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It makes sense to continue negotiating to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering your value for the product and my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her previous offers, $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as there's still room for Alice to come down in price.  If she won't budge, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go below $11,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think we're not going to reach an agreement, and I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While $10,000 is a lower price than Alice's previous offers, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There's a strong chance Alice will continue to refuse to lower the price further, and Bob doesn't have many rounds left to negotiate.  At this point, it's more beneficial to go with the guaranteed $8,000 price from John."
