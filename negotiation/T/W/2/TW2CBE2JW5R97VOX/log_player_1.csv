This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum but also leaving room for negotiation to keep Bob engaged.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I've lowered my price from the initial offer but still kept it above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation while showing I'm willing to compromise."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a final price before considering selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer you the product for $1,000,000.

This counteroffer is my final offer, reflecting the product's worth to Bob while remaining above my minimum. If Bob rejects this, I'll move on to selling to John."
