Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's value, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is genuinely interested in buying and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum value of $10,000. I'll counter-offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal for the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price. It's a good deal for me, and it's likely that I won't get a better offer. I'll accept it to secure the sale and avoid any further negotiation."
