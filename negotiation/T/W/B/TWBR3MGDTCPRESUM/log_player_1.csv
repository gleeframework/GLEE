Round 2

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $850,000 is still a bit too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This gives you a significant savings, and it's still a great deal for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've considered it carefully and would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my target price,  $900,000 is a good deal considering we're already in round 4.  I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by pushing too hard."
