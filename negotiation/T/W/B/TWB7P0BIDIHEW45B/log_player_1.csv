"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum.  I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm going to counter with $130. This is still above my minimum but shows some flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I hope this will be more appealing to Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject this offer.  I feel like there's still room to negotiate.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to go down to $125, which is just a little above my minimum. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John for $120."

Bob is offering my minimum price.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm going to sell to John to guarantee a sale at my minimum price."
