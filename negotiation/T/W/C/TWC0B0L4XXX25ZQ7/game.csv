"Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant and unique value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand the product's value, but $1,750,000 is still outside my range.  Let's try $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
