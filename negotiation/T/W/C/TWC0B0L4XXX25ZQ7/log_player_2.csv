"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's maximum budget.  It's essential to start negotiating and try to bring the price down.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the realm of possibility.  Bob is showing he's serious about buying but also establishing a clear price point.
* **Focus on Value:** The message highlights Bob's interest in the product while emphasizing that the price needs to be adjusted.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to make a counter-counteroffer, ensuring the negotiation continues."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant and unique value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still risky for Bob to accept.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand the product's value, but $1,750,000 is still outside my range.  Let's try $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** This counteroffer continues to move the price closer to Bob's target while still leaving room for compromise. 
* **Focus on Finality:** The message emphasizes Bob's commitment to closing the deal and suggests a sense of urgency.
* **Fairness:**  Bob highlights the ""fairness"" of the price, attempting to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and compromise."
