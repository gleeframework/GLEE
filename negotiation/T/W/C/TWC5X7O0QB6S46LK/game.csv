"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my needs and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the true value of the product and what it can do for your business. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth $1,000,000, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise and allows for some room for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be valuable for my business, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
