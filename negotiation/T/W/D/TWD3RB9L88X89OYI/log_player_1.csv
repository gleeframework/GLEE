Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. This is a one-time offer, as I already have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to sell to Bob for less.
* **Strong Stance:** By presenting the $10,000 price as a one-time offer and mentioning another buyer, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity. This can make Bob more likely to accept, even though he values the product less. 
* **No Room for Negotiation:** By starting at your desired price, you leave no room for Bob to negotiate you down."
