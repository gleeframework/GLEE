It's too early to buy from Alice. It's highly likely she'll come down in price. Let's see what kind of counteroffer we can get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Let's start with a strong counteroffer. $1,000,000 is my absolute limit.  If Alice is serious about selling, she should at least consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but we can still do better. Let's try to push her lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Let's see if we can split the difference and get this deal done.  $1,100,000 is still a good price for me and hopefully, a reasonable compromise for Alice."
