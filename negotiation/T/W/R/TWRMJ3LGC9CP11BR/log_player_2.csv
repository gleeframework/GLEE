"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but $8,000 is still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $13,000. This is my final offer for now.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I can meet you at $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently shown a reluctance to go below $11,000.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a strong chance she won't budge further.  We risk losing the guaranteed $10,000 deal with John if we push our luck. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
