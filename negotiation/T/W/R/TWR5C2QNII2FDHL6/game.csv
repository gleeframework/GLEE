"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8250. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a fantastic deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $8250 is still a little higher than I want to go.  How about $8000?  That's my absolute top offer.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is your absolute top offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8100. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8100.0,Alice,5,
