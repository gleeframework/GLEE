"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:**  Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and is a good deal, considering he values the product at $15,000.
* **No need for further negotiation:** There is no guarantee that a counteroffer will lead to a lower price, and Bob is already getting a good deal. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob continues to reject offers, Alice might withdraw her offer completely, forcing Bob to pay the higher price from John."
