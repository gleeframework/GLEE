Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $100, so offering it above that but below our minimum gives him a chance to get it at a price he deems fair.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a single offer scenario, starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested. 
 
Let's see what Bob decides!"
