"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but still lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone encourages Bob to consider the offer and opens the door for conversation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's worth emphasizes its potential benefit for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've achieved a good outcome!
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and strategize for the next round, keeping in mind John's $15,000 offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** $12,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I can likely get closer to my desired price point.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $15,000 provides a safety net and gives me leverage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our current positions. I'll consider factors like how much he's willing to pay and how many rounds I have left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This gives you a great deal and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is halfway between Bob's last offer ($12,500) and my last offer ($14,000), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fair Deal:**  I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us, highlighting the ""great deal"" and ""fair profit"" aspects.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate further if needed. I can come down a bit more if necessary, but I'm closer to my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! We've reached a deal. 
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll evaluate his counteroffer carefully and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13,000? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** We've made significant progress in the negotiation. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating, as I might not be able to get a better price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is higher, it's important to consider the potential loss of time and the possibility of a failed negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal. While not my ideal price, it's a good outcome considering the time and effort involved."
