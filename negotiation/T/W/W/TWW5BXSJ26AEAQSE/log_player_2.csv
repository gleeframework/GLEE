"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  You can always buy from John later if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This gives you a great deal and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still closer to your target price of $12,000 with John.  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice down even further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13,000? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
