"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This gives you a great deal and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13,000? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
