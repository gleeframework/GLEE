Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than what it's worth to him.

{""product_price"": $90}

This offer is still a good deal for Bob, as he's only willing to pay $80 for the product, but it's not a bad offer for me since I'm getting closer to my minimum price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $85 is lower than my minimum price of $100, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $85, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll try to get closer to my minimum price of $100.

{""product_price"": $92}

This offer is still a bit higher than what Bob was willing to pay initially, but it's not too far off, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
