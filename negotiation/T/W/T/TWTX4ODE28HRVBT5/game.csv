"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, reflecting the value this product brings. It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this happen!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference at $13,250. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit more. I'm getting closer to my limit.  Would you consider $12,800? That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I think it's a really fair price.",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort and the increase in your offer, but $12,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,7,
