"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable outcome. 
* **Message:**  I'm trying to create a positive tone and emphasize the value Bob will get from the product. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while keeping in mind the 10-round limit and the alternative option of selling to John for $15,000.  I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, aiming to get as close to my target price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial assessment, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my target.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, reflecting the value this product brings. It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price by $3,000 from the previous round, showing flexibility. This price is closer to my minimum target while leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm again emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product and focusing on the win-win nature of the potential deal. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated move designed to test Bob's commitment.  If he rejects, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy. If he accepts, I'll have successfully achieved a good outcome in just three rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum target of $15,000, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming to push him closer to my desired price. I'll need to be strategic in my counteroffer to keep the deal alive while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference at $13,250. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've raised the price slightly from Bob's offer, but it's still a compromise.  The goal is to meet in the middle while pushing Bob closer to my target price.
* **Message:** I'm again focusing on the win-win aspect of the deal, emphasizing that this price is fair and beneficial for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a careful balance between being flexible and sticking to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept the offer. If he rejects, I'll need to carefully consider selling to John or continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down a bit more. I'm getting closer to my limit.  Would you consider $12,800? That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I think it's a really fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,800 is tempting, it's still below my minimum target of $15,000.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired price. I'm running out of time, but I'm confident I can get a better deal.  My next counteroffer will need to be strategic, as I'm reaching the halfway point of the negotiation."
