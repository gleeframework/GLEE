"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $160 is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $140? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can do $155, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $155 is still above your maximum budget of $120.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, you have already gone through several rounds and it's unlikely Alice will come down further.  Buying from John for $120 is the best option to ensure you get the product within your budget."
