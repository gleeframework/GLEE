"Thank you for the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $140? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy if we can agree on that.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can do $155, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
