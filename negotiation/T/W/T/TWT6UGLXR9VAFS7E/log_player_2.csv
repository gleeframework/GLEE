"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $900000. It's a great deal for both of us â€“ you get a valuable product for less than its worth to you, and I get to sell it sooner than I would to my other buyer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
