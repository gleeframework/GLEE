"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point, especially since the product is worth that much to him. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm still confident the product is worth more.  How about $825,000? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer,  $775,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your flexibility.  $775,000 is a step closer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  Would you be willing to go up just a little bit more to $800,000?  This is a price that works for me, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm not willing to go above $775,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on it. Let's meet at $775,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob seems stubborn and is unwilling to budge, and I've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial goal, it's important to be realistic and secure a sale. John is offering a fair price, and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob at this point."
