"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm still confident the product is worth more.  How about $825,000? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your flexibility.  $775,000 is a step closer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  Would you be willing to go up just a little bit more to $800,000?  This is a price that works for me, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm not willing to go above $775,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on it. Let's meet at $775,000.",775000.0,Bob,6,
