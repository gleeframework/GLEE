"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. I'm asking $120 for it.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $105 is getting closer, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about we split the difference and do $97?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",97.0,Bob,4,
