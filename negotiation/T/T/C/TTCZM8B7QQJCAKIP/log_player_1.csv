Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer again, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum. While it's tempting to go for the guaranteed sale,  I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway and hopefully getting closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer. It's also higher than John's offer.  To avoid further negotiation and secure a sale, I'll accept Bob's offer."
