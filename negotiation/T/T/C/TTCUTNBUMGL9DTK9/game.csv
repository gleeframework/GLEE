"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about $8,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value and allows for some wiggle room. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider this price?",7800.0,Bob,4,
