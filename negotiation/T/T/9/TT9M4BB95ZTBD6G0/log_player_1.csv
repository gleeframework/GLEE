Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident that I can still get a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I want to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and a good deal considering the time spent negotiating. It's also a good opportunity to close the deal quickly and avoid potential complications with further negotiations."
