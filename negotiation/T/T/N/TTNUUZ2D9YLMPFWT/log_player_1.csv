"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product's potential."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This establishes a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Framing Value:** My message focuses on the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room:** By starting high, I signal flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the process.

This strategy allows me to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option open to move closer to his perceived value or accept John's offer if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. It's clear we have room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I will counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about we consider $1,600,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing understanding, which helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Reiterating Value:** I subtly reiterate the product's value, subtly pushing back against his low assessment.
* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:**  I've made a substantial drop from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, the new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** By framing the counteroffer as a compromise, I encourage Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my desired range.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be frank, I'm thinking closer to $950,000. That feels like a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer slightly, $950,000 is still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum.  I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if we can't reach a more agreeable price. Rejecting this offer will hopefully incentivize Bob to make a more serious offer in the next round. I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 is simply too far below the product's true market value. I've got another buyer interested who sees its full potential. I'm willing to give you one more chance to make a serious offer. If we can agree on a price of $1,400,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to move forward with the other buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure & Alternative:** I'm introducing a sense of urgency and a credible alternative buyer (John). This lets Bob know I'm not afraid to walk away and have other options if we can't reach a deal.
* **Final Offer:**  By framing $1,400,000 as my ""final offer,"" I'm putting the ball in Bob's court and making it clear that this is my bottom line.
* **Still Above Bob's Value:** The price is still significantly above Bob's stated perceived value, allowing for the possibility of him meeting me closer to my minimum. 

This approach aims to push Bob to make a decision â€“ either meet my price or risk losing the deal altogether."
