"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000, but still giving Bob some room to negotiate. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm not yet at the point where I'm willing to settle for that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm offering a price just above my minimum value.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting as close to $15,000 as possible, and he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, I'm still only one round away from selling to John for $15,000, so I'm going to try to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm offering a price just slightly above Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping that he'll see that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm close to my minimum value and I won't go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and while I could continue to counteroffer Bob, there's a risk that he'll reject and we'll run out of time. Given that John is offering my minimum value, it's safer to sell to him and guarantee the $15,000."
