It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice first.  A counteroffer is a good starting point to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer of $1,000,000. This gives us a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a good deal considering our starting point.  We can save $150,000 compared to buying from John. It's time to accept the offer."
