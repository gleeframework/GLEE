Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible since she has a guaranteed buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message highlights the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

By starting high, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal closer to her desired price point while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider over simply rejecting it."
