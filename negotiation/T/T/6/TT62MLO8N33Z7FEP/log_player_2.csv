"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  It's worth negotiating to see if a better price can be reached.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 is the best alternative, but it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counter Offer:**  Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously. 
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for the offer, highlighting his budget constraint. This makes the offer more believable and less likely to be perceived as simply trying to lowball Alice.
* **Open to Compromise:** Bob expresses a willingness to negotiate further, signaling that he is open to finding a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This would still give you a great deal, and allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Comparison:** Alice's counter-offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay from John ($1,000,000).
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's still room for negotiation, as Alice has shown a willingness to come down from her initial price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price.

**Next Steps:** Bob should aim for a price closer to $1,000,000 in his next counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  This price would provide you with a fair deal, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer presents Bob's final offer and makes it clear he's not willing to go higher. It's a fair price considering Alice's own valuation of the product.
* **Direct Language:** The message is direct and avoids beating around the bush. It clearly lays out Bob's position.
* **Highlighting Benefits:** Bob frames the offer as providing a ""fair deal"" to Alice, emphasizing the mutual benefit of a quick agreement.

**Next Steps:** This is a strong offer, but if Alice rejects, Bob should be prepared to walk away and buy from John, as the price is no longer advantageous."
