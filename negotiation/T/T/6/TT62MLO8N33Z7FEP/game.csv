"Alice, $1200000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This would still give you a great deal, and allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  This price would provide you with a fair deal, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
