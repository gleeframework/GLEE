Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to secure a profit.
* **Negotiation Buffer:**  A $12,000 price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John at $15,000 allows me to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room for a better counteroffer. I can potentially get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:**  John's offer of $15,000 provides me with a fallback option if negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm using a counteroffer to signal flexibility while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Compromise:**  $10,500 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his initial counteroffer. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price point still allows me to make a profit while leaving room for potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $10,500. How about we meet at $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:**  While $9,800 is closer to my minimum price, it's still a substantial distance from my desired profit margin. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continued negotiation with Bob could lead to a prolonged stalemate, potentially causing me to lose time and potentially even a better deal with John.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a significantly higher profit ($15,000) and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  

Since John offers a price that meets my minimum requirements and provides a much higher profit, it's the most logical decision to sell to John at this point."
