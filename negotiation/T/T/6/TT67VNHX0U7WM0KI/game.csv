"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from $10,500. How about we meet at $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
