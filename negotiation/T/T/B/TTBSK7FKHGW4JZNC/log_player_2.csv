"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000.  What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation environment. We also provide a reason for our counteroffer (""a little steep"") without revealing our true valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work.  Let's find a solution that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, it's not a significant drop. We're still aiming to get closer to the $7,000 mark. 
* **Time is a Factor:**  We have several rounds left, so there's no need to rush into accepting an offer that's not ideal. We can continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $7,750?"",
 ""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Compromise:** By meeting Alice halfway between our previous offer and her counteroffer, we signal that we're serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Stay Firm on Target:** We're still aiming to stay as close to $7,000 as possible, and this counteroffer keeps us within a reasonable range.
* **Simple and Direct:**  A clear and concise offer can help move the negotiation forward efficiently."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower to $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** Alice's price reductions are getting smaller. This could mean she's getting closer to her bottom line.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** We're still above our target price, and with five rounds remaining, there's room to negotiate further.  We might be able to push Alice closer to $8,000. 
* **John as a Backup:** It's good to keep in mind that we have the option to buy from John for $10,000. This gives us leverage and prevents us from feeling pressured to accept a suboptimal deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be completely transparent, my budget for this is closer to $8,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:**  By being transparent about our budget and desire to close the deal quickly, we create a sense of urgency.
* **Firm but Fair:** We're sticking to a price point close to our target, showing Alice we're serious.
* **Clear Call to Action:** We've made it easy for Alice to accept by stating we'll close the deal immediately at $8,000."
