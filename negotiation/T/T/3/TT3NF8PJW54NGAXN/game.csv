"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $2000000. This is a competitive price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is unfortunately way beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $500000 at this time.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your serious offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the value of the product and the initial offer I made, I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer of $1750000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still reflects the product's worth. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial price.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $700000.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $700000, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. Considering the value I know it holds, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking more in the range of $1200000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's closer to the product's true value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
