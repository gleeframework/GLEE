"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $150, but her offer of $120 is still above your target.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds to close the deal, so rejecting the first offer allows you to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer is your backup.**  If the negotiation with Alice fails, you have a guaranteed option with John, but it's not your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105, which is still a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $105 is a significant drop from $120 but still gives Alice a profit above her value.
* **Express willingness to pay:**  Phrasing it as a ""great deal"" for Alice emphasizes your commitment to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. This is still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your desired price.** $115 is closer to your target of $105, and you're still getting a better deal than buying from John for $150.
* **Time is a factor.**  While further negotiation is possible, accepting now gives you a good deal while still leaving 7 rounds to close a deal. 
* **Risk of stalemate:**  Continuing to bargain could lead to a stalemate or a higher price later."
