"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. While I'm willing to compromise, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
