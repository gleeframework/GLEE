"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer.  While Alice's offer is tempting, Bob can potentially save even more money by negotiating.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to Bob's target price of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $950000. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1025000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. While Alice's new offer is closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can aim for a price closer to $1,000,000, potentially saving an additional $25,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to save more, but I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous one. I'm offering it to you for $1012500. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has been negotiating with Alice for a while.  He's already rejected Alice's offers at $1,025,000 and $1,012,500.  Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,000,000, and Bob can purchase the product from John for that price.  It's more advantageous for Bob to close the deal with John and avoid further negotiations with Alice."
