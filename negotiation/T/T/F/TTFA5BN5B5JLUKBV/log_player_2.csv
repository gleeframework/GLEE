"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. There's no reason to accept it.  You should proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum budget is $10,000, I'm making a counteroffer at that price.  This is the lowest I'm willing to go. If Alice rejects, I can always buy from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $12,000. This is still within my budget and closer to my ideal price. Hopefully, Alice sees this as a reasonable compromise and accepts the offer.  If she doesn't, I'll still have the option to buy from John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above my maximum budget. At this point, I've made multiple counteroffers and Alice has not been willing to budge much.  It's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a price I'm comfortable with. I'm going to buy the product from John for $10,000 to avoid wasting more time and ensure I get the product within my budget."
