Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to accept anything less than $1,000,000. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and it's still a good deal for Bob since he values the product at that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough. I'll see if I can get a better counteroffer from him before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a compromise that might be acceptable to him while still ensuring I get a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge on his offer, and I'm getting tired of negotiating. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $1,200,000, it's better to take the guaranteed profit than to continue a seemingly fruitless negotiation."
