Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to finalize this deal. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!
