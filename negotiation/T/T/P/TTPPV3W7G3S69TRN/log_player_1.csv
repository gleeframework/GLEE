Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to $120 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm countering with $110. This is a compromise that's closer to my initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $105 is a good deal and is closer to my desired price point. It's also significantly better than selling to John for $80."
