Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by leaving some room for Bob to counter without immediately rejecting. It also highlights the value of the product to him, aiming to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to consider $12,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is still a good profit, it's less than my initial offer.  I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,250? I believe this is still a very fair price for the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,500 again, or perhaps a bit lower? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would have preferred a higher price, Bob has shown he's unlikely to go higher. Accepting $12,000 still gives me a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by going back and forth further."
