Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable value. It's important to start high, but not unreasonably high, to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable value. Hopefully, this is a price that Bob will find appealing, but if not, we can continue to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I'd prefer, it's now above my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially resulting in a lower price or a sale to John for the lower price."
