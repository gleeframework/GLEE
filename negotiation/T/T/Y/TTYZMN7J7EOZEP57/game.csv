"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and still reflects the product's value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price. This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $875,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $885,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your budget constraints.",885000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $885,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $880,000 is the maximum I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",880000.0,Bob,6,
