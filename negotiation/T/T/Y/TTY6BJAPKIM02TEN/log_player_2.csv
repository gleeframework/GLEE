"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You should definitely counter-offer with a much lower price to see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual budget ($120). This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially secure a great deal.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite and shows interest, but clearly states your price limit.
* **Leaving Room:** By offering $80, we leave a significant gap between our offer and Alice's starting price, creating space for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $160 is still significantly above your budget and the price John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moved from her initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. There's a chance she might come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice.  How about we try to find a middle ground at $100? "",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** We're increasing our offer, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not jumping too high too quickly.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $100 is still a good distance below our $120 maximum and keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price significantly. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help us gauge Alice's flexibility and how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:**  Alice is making slow concessions, and at $140, she's still significantly above your $120 limit.
* **John's Offer is Better:** You have a guaranteed option with John at $120. It makes no sense to pay more than that when you can get the product elsewhere for a better price. 
* **Time Cost:** Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a price you're happy with, and it has an opportunity cost."
