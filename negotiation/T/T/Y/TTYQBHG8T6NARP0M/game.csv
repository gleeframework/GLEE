"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, Alice, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105.  Let me know if you're able to go that low.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $110. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,5,
