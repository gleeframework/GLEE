"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a good price, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower.  There are still 9 rounds left, so there's plenty of time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $80?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, but it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for Alice to counter back without feeling pressured. 
* **Clear communication:** The message clearly states Bob's position and opens the door for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $80 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good price for such a great product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While $90 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining momentum:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation moving and gives Bob more leverage to potentially get a lower price.
* **Avoiding settling too early:** There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob shouldn't rush into accepting a price that's not his absolute best."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $85.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental offer:** Bob is making a smaller counteroffer this time, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Reasoning:** He provides a reason for his counteroffer, making it more persuasive.
* **Open-ended question:** The question encourages Alice to respond and continue the negotiation."
