"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than the value you've placed on it. I'm confident we can come to an agreement. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Would this be acceptable to you?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000.  This still offers you a significant value gain, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I must adhere to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. I hope this proposal will be more in line with what you're considering.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product. This is the highest amount I can afford while staying within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
