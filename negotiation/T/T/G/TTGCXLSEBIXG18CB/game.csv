"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $1200000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I believe it will bring to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1100000. I believe this price still represents a fair value for the product, considering its worth to you and my minimum price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price represents a fair compromise given our respective needs.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me at a higher price. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950000 yet. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1050000. This price is still below my minimum, but it's a fair reflection of the value the product will bring to you, considering our previous discussions.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still holding out for a higher price, but $1050000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a compromise I believe is fair given the value of the product to both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
