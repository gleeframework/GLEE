Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you significant negotiating power.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing within a range that's highly profitable for you (well above your $800,000 minimum).
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer at $800,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept anything below your minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a sense that he's getting a reasonable deal."
