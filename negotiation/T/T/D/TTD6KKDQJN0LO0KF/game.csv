"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again. I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
