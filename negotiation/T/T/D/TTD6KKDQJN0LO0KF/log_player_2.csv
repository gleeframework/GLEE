Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $12,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's no longer strategically sound to continue negotiating with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $12,500, and you can get the product for $12,000 from John. Take the guaranteed savings!"
