Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:**  Highlighting the product's worth to Bob creates a sense of its value. 
* **Open-ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" keeps the conversation open and invites Bob to respond.

This approach aims to:

* Secure a good price, ideally closer to $15,000.
* Gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffers.
* Avoid immediately setting off a negotiation war by being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob is interested and acknowledged the product's value. This suggests the possibility of a higher counteroffer from him.
* **Avoiding Settling:** Selling to John for $10,000 would be the same as accepting Bob's offer.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm compensated fairly for the product's value. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering $12,000 shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum and closer to my initial asking price.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value reminds Bob why this price is justified.
* **Specific Proposal:**  Giving a concrete counteroffer ($12,000) keeps the negotiation focused.

**Goals:**

* Get closer to my ideal price of $13,000 or potentially even $14,000.
* Maintain a balanced approach to avoid an impasse.
* Gauge Bob's commitment to the deal and his willingness to compromise further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we go with $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $11,500 is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Bob is showing a clear reluctance to go higher.  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or his walking away.
* **Better than John's Offer:** Accepting $11,500 is a better outcome than selling to John for $10,000.

**Outcome:** This decision secures a sale with a reasonable profit margin, considering the risks involved in further negotiation."
