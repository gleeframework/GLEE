"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I can't go as low as $1,100,000. My final offer is $1,250,000.  This is a very competitive price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
