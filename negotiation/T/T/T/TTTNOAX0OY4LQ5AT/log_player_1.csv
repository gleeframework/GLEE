{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but allows room for negotiation. It also leaves some room for me to lower the price if necessary, while still exceeding the minimum I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $875,000, as a compromise.  This would still give you a good deal, while allowing me to reach a more reasonable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you consider my offer again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his offer, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  John is a guaranteed sale for $1,000,000, which is a better deal for me.  I'll accept John's offer and sell to him."
