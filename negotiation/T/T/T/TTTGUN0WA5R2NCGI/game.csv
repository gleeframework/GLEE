"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a good return. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
