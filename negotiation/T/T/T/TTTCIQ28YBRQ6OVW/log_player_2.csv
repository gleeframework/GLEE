"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on a fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's, there's no advantage to rejecting and buying from John. You might as well accept Alice's offer."
