{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to counteroffer, but you can use this opportunity to gauge his interest and potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $100. I will reject it and attempt to counteroffer for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $105?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum value and a fair compromise.  It's better than selling to John for the same price, as it avoids the hassle of a separate transaction.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
