"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reason:  Bob wants to save as much money as possible. $95 is too close to John's price, making it worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $90 is closer to his target, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my offer of $85.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 just isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Bob has been trying to get the price down to $85. Alice has counter-offered with $87.50, which is only $2.50 more than his target.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and the possibility of having to buy from John for $100 make accepting Alice's offer the best option in this round."
