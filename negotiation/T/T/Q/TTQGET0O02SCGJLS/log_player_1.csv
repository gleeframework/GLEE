Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. I think this is a fair deal considering the benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, aiming for a price close to Bob's maximum valuation is ideal. However, being too aggressive (e.g., offering at $11,500) might make Bob reject the offer. 
* **The Offer:** Offering the product at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting and provides you with a $2,000 profit margin.

By starting the negotiation with a strong but reasonable offer, you increase your chances of a successful sale at a price that benefits both parties."
