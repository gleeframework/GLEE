"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to start with this offer. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,900,000?  I believe this reflects the product's true value while still being a good deal for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,700,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,700,000 is getting closer, but to be honest, I have a hard limit at $1,800,000. This is my final offer - I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. ",1800000.0,Alice,5,
