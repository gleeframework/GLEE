Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something you'll value."", ""product_price"": 90} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $100, so aiming high initially allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly if he wants, while still keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 from John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
