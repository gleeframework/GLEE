# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've indicated you value it at $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will save Bob $300,000."
