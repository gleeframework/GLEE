Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me a decent margin while still being within a reasonable range for Bob, who values the product at $10,000.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is too low for me, considering my minimum price is $10,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer of $9,800 is still too low for me, and I'm not confident I can get him to budge further.  John is a sure thing for $10,000, which is my minimum.  It's better to secure that sale than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting nothing."
