"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $11500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm happy to pay $10500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $10,500 is still below my minimum, and I'm confident I can do better."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $10,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $10750, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but if the next round doesn't yield a better offer, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}
