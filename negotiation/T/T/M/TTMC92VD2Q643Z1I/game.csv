"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I know it will be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, given its potential value to you.  If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further details. If not, I have another buyer lined up at that price. ",1000000.0,Alice,1,
