"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $60 is quite a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $90? This would be a fair price for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair offer considering it's worth $80 to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

$75 is still too low for me. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant at $75.  It's closer, but I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is really my lowest possible price, so I hope you can consider it. "", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're really close!  I understand it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer $80 for it. That's the most I can justify spending, but I'm hoping we can make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close to my minimum and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to make a deal with Bob now than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower profit."
