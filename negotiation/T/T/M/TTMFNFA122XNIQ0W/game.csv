"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $60 is quite a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $90? This would be a fair price for both of us, I think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair offer considering it's worth $80 to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant at $75.  It's closer, but I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is really my lowest possible price, so I hope you can consider it. ",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close!  I understand it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer $80 for it. That's the most I can justify spending, but I'm hoping we can make a deal!",80.0,Bob,6,
