{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $18,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially still make a good profit.
* **Expressing openness:** I'm emphasizing that I'm open to discussing a fair price. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and reach an agreement.
* **Asking for feedback:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts. This encourages him to engage in the negotiation and provides me with information about his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I have the opportunity to counter Bob's offer and potentially negotiate a more favorable price. This is a better option than accepting his current offer or selling to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Would you be open to $14,000? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my original offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality and value to justify the price.
* **Open to further discussion:** I'm still open to further discussion, implying I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $14000 is a step closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even at $10,000, Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  The negotiation is taking time, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who may not be willing to meet my needs."
