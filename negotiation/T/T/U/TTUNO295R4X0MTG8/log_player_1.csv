Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives him some room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can always come down a bit, or switch to John if he's not willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. It's below my minimum value of $150. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $150?  That's fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love this product."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
