Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum but still below what the product is worth to Bob.  I'm hoping to maximize my earnings while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd still like to get closer to my target price of $11,500, Bob's offer of $10,800 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price and significantly better than selling to John for $10,000. It's time to close the deal and secure a good profit."
