"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $20,000 is not a good deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  This offer is a bold move, but it might entice Alice to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still too high for Bob.  It's better to continue negotiating and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He increases his offer from $10,000 to $12,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget.  This counteroffer might encourage Alice to make a more favorable counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. While it's closer, Bob should still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget.  This offer of $14,000 is a serious attempt to reach an agreement with Alice, but it's still within his limit. If Alice rejects this offer, he can always go to John and buy the product for $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is only slightly lower than John's price, and continuing to negotiate might result in Alice increasing her price again. It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $15,000, which is within your budget."
