"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you can work with.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is close, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it to be worthwhile for me. That's my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
