Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to earn significantly more than my minimum threshold of $120.  I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer as he values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I could sell to John for $120, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to earn more than selling to John. I believe Bob might be willing to pay this price since it's closer to his initial value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my ideal price, but it's significantly better than selling to John for $120. There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate with Bob will only result in more rejections and wasted time.  It's best to accept his offer and secure a sale."
