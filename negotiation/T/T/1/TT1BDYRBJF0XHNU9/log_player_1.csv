"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I've done some research and I think it's a bit pricey at $15000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $12,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $13,500. This price still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to sell it to me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for that amount. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $12,500. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and potential.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $11500. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my asking price, I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are not producing a satisfactory outcome.  I'm confident that selling to John is the best decision for me at this point."
