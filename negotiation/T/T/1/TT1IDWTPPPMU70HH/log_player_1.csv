Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer starts by building a rapport with Bob and offering a price that is attractive to him while still leaving room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in buying the product at a price that is profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a nice product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I can likely get more by counteroffering.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to pay a bit closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a fair offer, I'm looking to get closer to $120 for this product.  It's a great deal for you, and still leaves room for us both to make a profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $120 is closer, but I'm trying to keep it under $115. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is close to my minimum acceptable price and likely the best I can get from him. It's a good deal for me, especially since I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiations fall apart."
