"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay as little as possible, so we start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's opening. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** While low, the offer isn't insulting.  We want to keep the negotiation moving smoothly. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer gives us space to negotiate upwards towards our $80 maximum while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product.  $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not quite:** Alice is getting closer to our ideal price, but $85 is still above our $80 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We have time for another counter-offer. Since Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, there's a good chance she's willing to negotiate further. 
* **Leverage:**  Alice knows we have the option to buy from John for $80.  While we don't want to reveal that as our absolute limit, we can use it implicitly by pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer, how about $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We want to show Alice we're willing to move towards her price, but not too quickly. A $10 increase from our last offer keeps the negotiation active.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $75 puts us firmly in the middle ground between Alice's current offer ($85) and our ideal price ($80).
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By not accepting $85, we subtly remind Alice that we have other options, even without explicitly mentioning John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $80? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price Achieved:** Alice has met our ideal price of $80.  There's no point in negotiating further or risking losing the deal. 
* **Time Saved:**  By accepting now, we avoid potentially lengthy back-and-forth negotiations and secure the product. 
* **Equivalent to Alternative:**  Alice's offer is now equal to John's price. We gain no further benefit by switching to John."
