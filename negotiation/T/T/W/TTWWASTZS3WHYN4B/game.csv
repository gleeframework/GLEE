"Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know it's valuable to you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a small profit while still giving you a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!",12500.0,Alice,1,
