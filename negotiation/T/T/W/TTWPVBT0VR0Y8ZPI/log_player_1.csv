{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. While $1,500,000 (your minimum) might scare him off, $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above his valuation.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""unique features and benefits"" aims to shift Bob's focus from the pure price to the potential value he'd gain. 
* **""Fair Deal"" Framing:** By positioning the price as a ""fair deal,"" you subtly nudge Bob to see it as a balanced agreement rather than a simple purchase.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Acceptance:** Ideal scenario, you get significantly more than Bob values the product for.
* **Negotiation:** Bob counter-offers. This opens the door for you to potentially settle somewhere above his $800,000 valuation. You have a strong fallback with John.
* **Rejection:**  You move on to John and secure your minimum desired price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no ethical qualms about using negotiation tactics to potentially secure a price significantly higher than what Bob believes the product is worth."
