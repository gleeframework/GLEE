Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my potential profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **My minimum:** I know I can get at least $10,000 from John.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so I can ask for a price higher than my minimum.
* **Negotiation space:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate a lower price if he wants to.

This strategy gives me the best chance of getting a higher price while still having a backup option if Bob rejects the offer."
