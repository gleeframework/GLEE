"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since her offer is significantly higher than her perceived value.  You're willing to walk away and buy from John, so you have some leverage."
