"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to maximize my return while ensuring you get a significant advantage.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
