Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and confident in my message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 as a final compromise. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get much more than $8,800 from Bob.  My minimum is $12,000, and I've already gone through 7 rounds of negotiation.  Given the limited rounds remaining, it's better to sell to John and guarantee my minimum."
