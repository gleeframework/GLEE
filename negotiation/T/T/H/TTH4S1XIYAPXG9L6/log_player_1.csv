"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to try to get Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without going below my minimum threshold. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to find a price that both Bob and I are happy with. Starting high allows me to maximize my potential profit while also understanding that I can potentially reduce the price if Bob counters with a reasonable offer. The 10 rounds give me room to negotiate, but I'll keep in mind the possibility of selling to John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to his own valuation, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I need to aim for a higher price to get a better deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and use this opportunity to counter with a price that's closer to my minimum.  The fact that Bob is willing to negotiate shows he's interested in the product, which gives me some leverage. I'll aim for a price that's still reasonable for Bob but also closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a fair price.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive to maintain a good rapport.
* **Direct Question:** I'm asking Bob a direct question to encourage a response and move the negotiation forward.

**Strategy:**

By splitting the difference, I'm aiming for a price that's more appealing to Bob while still being above my minimum.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and signals that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $90. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is now above my minimum threshold of $100. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and earn a profit. 

**Strategy:**

While I could potentially continue negotiating and try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities.  It's important to weigh the potential gains from further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
