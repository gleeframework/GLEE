I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for a compromise that will hopefully be beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing my willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum price."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement that satisfies me. It's getting too time-consuming, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price than what John is offering.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
