Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept it.  If he doesn't, I have the option to sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept it.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to me and to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum asking price."
