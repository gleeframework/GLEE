Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a strong starting point. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, and if so, how much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,600,000. It's still above Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. This price is still within my minimum acceptable range, but it gives Bob some space to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to continue negotiating to try and reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,450,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. This price is still above Bob's latest offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of a prolonged negotiation is that Bob might walk away, leaving me with no sale.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to sell to John to guarantee a sale at a satisfactory price."
