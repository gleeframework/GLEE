It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where Alice is unlikely to go much lower. She's repeatedly stated she's near her minimum.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're down to the last few rounds. Continuing to push might irritate Alice, and we risk her final offer being even higher.
* **Significant Savings:** $700,000 is still a $300,000 savings compared to John's offer. 

While we might be able to squeeze out a tiny bit more from Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential benefit."
