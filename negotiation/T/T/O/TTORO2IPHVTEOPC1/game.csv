"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my top offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to see something closer to $1250000 to make this worthwhile.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll recognize the significant benefit this product can bring to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
