Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to see something closer to $1250000 to make this worthwhile.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll recognize the significant benefit this product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and it seems unlikely she will go lower.  I'm better off buying the product from John for $1,000,000."
