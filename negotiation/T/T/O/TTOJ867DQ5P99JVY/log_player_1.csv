Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** The offer of $140 is strategically placed. It's more than Bob values the product at ($120), but less than what John is willing to pay ($150). This creates an incentive for Bob to potentially accept, knowing he could get a perceived ""deal."" 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I'm aiming high, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer.  The difference between my asking price and my minimum ($140 vs $150) provides some flexibility. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $140. He might try to negotiate further, or he might reject the offer outright. However, this strategy maximizes the potential profit while still offering Bob a price that could be tempting."
