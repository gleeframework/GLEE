"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, considering your own valuation.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product while staying within my budget.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $1,150,000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,180,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a competitive price that reflects the true value of the product.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
