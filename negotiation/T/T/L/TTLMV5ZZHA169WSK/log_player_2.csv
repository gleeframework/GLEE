"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum price point of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to lower her price since you're a potential buyer and she values the product at $1,500,000."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, considering your own valuation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer to my target price, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $1,150,000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,180,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a competitive price that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,180,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made several counteroffers and Alice seems unwilling to go lower.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John for $1,000,000.  It saves me $180,000 and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
