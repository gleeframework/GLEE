"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** The price is still within a range where Bob might be willing to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Note:**  This is just my initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, he has shown interest in the product. There's room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to give up yet.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's closer to my desired price but still leaves some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is still a good price for both of us, and it gives us a chance to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our last offers, but it still keeps me well above my minimum.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to see the benefit of the deal.
* **Motivation:** The offer emphasizes that both parties can benefit from a deal, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and I need to be strategic.  Selling to John at this point would secure a better price than Bob's current offer. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price from Bob, particularly since he's shown interest and willingness to compromise. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm getting closer to my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, and it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to move forward."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm making a smaller compromise this time, signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I highlight the fact that I'm making a significant compromise, aiming to create a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer tests if Bob is genuinely interested in closing the deal. If he rejects, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're past the halfway point of the negotiations, and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum.
* **Risk of Lower Price:** There's a high chance that Bob will continue to offer prices below my minimum in the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John guarantees me the full $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and higher than any offer Bob has made so far. 

I'm confident that John's offer is the best option to maximize my profit at this point in the negotiations."
