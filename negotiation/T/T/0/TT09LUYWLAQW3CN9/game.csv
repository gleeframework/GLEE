"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and a reasonable compromise for me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  However, $700,000 just doesn't work for me.  My final offer is $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  If you're not able to accept this offer, I'll have to move on to other buyers. ",850000.0,Alice,5,
