Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  However, $700,000 just doesn't work for me.  My final offer is $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  If you're not able to accept this offer, I'll have to move on to other buyers.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $850,000, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000. It makes more sense to take the sure saving of $50,000 at this point."
