"Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 right now.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? Let's make this deal happen.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can do $110, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still out of my budget. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $110. However, I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in some additional value. I'll include a free accessory that normally costs $20. So, the total value you'll be getting is $130. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,7,
