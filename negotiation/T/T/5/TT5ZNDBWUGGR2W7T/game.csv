"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? ",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I think this is the lowest price I can offer while still making a profit. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
