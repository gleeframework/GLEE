"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is within Bob's budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? This would still be a good deal for you and allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest price possible. While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her original price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
