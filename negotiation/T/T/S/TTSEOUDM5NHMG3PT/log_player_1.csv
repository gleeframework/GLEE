Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. How does $11,000 sound?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Ensure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $11,000 is a much better outcome than selling to John for $8,000.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between being assertive and still leaving Bob feeling like he got a reasonable deal."
