"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives him room to negotiate while ensuring I don't undervalue my product. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and sets a positive tone, emphasizing the potential for a win-win situation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick win in the first round, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary. By offering a price higher than Bob's estimated value, I'm creating pressure for him to accept. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Rejecting the Offer:**  While $1,200,000 is a tempting number,  I'm prioritizing maximizing my profits.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a significantly higher amount.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired range while keeping the negotiation open."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price from $1,700,000 to $1,600,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone polite and emphasizing the mutual benefits of the deal. I'm also using a common negotiation tactic:  suggesting a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to compromise.

**Strategy:**

By lowering my price but remaining firm on my minimum acceptable value, I'm putting the pressure on Bob to either accept my counteroffer or make a higher counteroffer of his own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome.  Accepting would mean losing out on potentially higher profits. 
* **Rejecting the Offer:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price, considering I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's statement that this is his ""final offer"" is a common tactic to create pressure, but I won't be swayed.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to my desired price. The negotiation is becoming more intense, but I'm confident I can reach a more favorable outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Let's try $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement and finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm raising my offer slightly from $1,500,000 to $1,550,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and focusing on the mutual benefits of the deal. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to both parties.

**Strategy:**

By making a small increase in my offer, I'm subtly increasing the pressure on Bob to accept. This is a strategy to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to go a little higher. It also helps me gauge his seriousness in closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still looking for a bit more, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept since I'm running out of time, I'm prioritizing maximizing my profits.
* **Rejecting the Offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product.  I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which gives me a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to my desired price. The pressure is on, but I'm determined to secure the best possible deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Remember, I also have another buyer ready to purchase at this price. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm  firmly setting my price at $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with John's offer.  
* **Message:** I'm  emphasizing the finality of my offer, using the ""meet you halfway"" tactic again, and  mentioning John's offer as a subtle pressure point.

**Strategy:**

This round is crucial. I'm making it clear that $1,500,000 is my bottom line,  putting the ball in Bob's court. If he rejects, I can confidently move on to John and secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,475,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to compromise.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,475,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm running out of time to reach my desired price.
* **Selling to John:**  To ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale and secure a reasonable profit, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This is the best option considering the current negotiation situation.

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer to close a deal with Bob, I need to be realistic about the current circumstances. Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price, and there are only two rounds left. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, minimizing risk and ensuring a satisfactory outcome."
