,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Let's try $1,550,000.

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Remember, I also have another buyer ready to purchase at this price. Let's make this deal happen.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
