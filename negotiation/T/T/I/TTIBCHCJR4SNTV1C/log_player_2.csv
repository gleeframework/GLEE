"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind item. I'm looking for $15000 for it. It's a rare find, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, and both Alice and John are offering the product for the same price, it makes no difference who Bob buys from.  He can buy from either Alice or John, but there's no advantage to buying from Alice."
