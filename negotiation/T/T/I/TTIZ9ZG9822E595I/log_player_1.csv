I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit. However, I'm aware that this might be too high for Bob. If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer at this time.  While it's better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired profit. I will counteroffer and see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing the price to $1,250,000. It's still a considerable profit for me and shows I'm willing to compromise. I hope this counteroffer is acceptable to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want.  I'm accepting his offer.  It's still a good profit, and continuing to negotiate risks that he may walk away entirely."
