"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal, as you know the value is much higher for you. Let's start our negotiation here, and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this stage. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves a significant margin for you to profit from this opportunity. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $875,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to move forward with the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value your willingness to negotiate and appreciate your latest offer.  However, $875,000 isn't quite where I need to be. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to both move forward with this mutually beneficial deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $890,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering $885,000.
