"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, $900,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000? This would still leave you with a substantial profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  How about $1,000,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and ensures a smooth transaction.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
