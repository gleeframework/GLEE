"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $1,600,000. This is a very competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's a good sign she's willing to negotiate, so you should reject the offer and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,450,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,450,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's a step in the right direction, there's still room for negotiation. You can try a counteroffer again to see if you can get closer to your target price."
