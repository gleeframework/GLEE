"I'd like to offer you the product for $1,600,000. This is a very competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,450,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This would still leave you with a good profit margin, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that works for you.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
