,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $95? I'm really interested in the product.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price for this incredible product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
