"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,300,000, I'm aiming to set a high anchor point in Bob's mind. Even if he rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers might be influenced by this higher number.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,300,000 offer leaves ample space for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, he'll likely try to conceal this information and negotiate for a lower price.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net and leverage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant move from his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter-offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. It shows you're serious about this product. To be frank, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we settle somewhere in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession & Encouragement:** I acknowledge Bob's movement by saying I appreciate his higher offer, keeping the tone positive and encouraging further negotiation.
* **Strategic Counter:** My counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a $150,000 decrease from my initial offer and  $250,000 above Bob's offer. This signals flexibility on my part while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Time Consideration:** We're still in the early rounds, so there's time for back-and-forth. I'm not rushing to accept an offer below my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated that $950,000 is his final offer.  This signals that he's unlikely to go any higher.
* **Below Minimum:** Even with his movement, Bob's offer remains below my absolute minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John represents a guaranteed sale at my desired price. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob when I have a sure thing with John.

**It's important to remember that negotiation involves understanding when to walk away from a deal that won't meet your needs.**"
