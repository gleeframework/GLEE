,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value is considerably higher than your current offer. I could consider letting it go for $16,000.  This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
