"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000 to make this deal work. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $920,000?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $920,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $935,000. This is a very fair price considering the product's value, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen.",935000.0,Alice,5,
