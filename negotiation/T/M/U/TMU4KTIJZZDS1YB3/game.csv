"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,500. Would that be something you'd consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still trying to get as close as possible to your target price. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,250, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",10250.0,Alice,7,
