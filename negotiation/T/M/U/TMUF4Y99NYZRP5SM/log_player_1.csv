{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving me room for negotiation if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Highlighting other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Outcome:**

This offer sets a strong starting point.  There's a chance Bob accepts outright. If not, it opens the door for negotiation where I can potentially still secure a price above $1,200,000."
