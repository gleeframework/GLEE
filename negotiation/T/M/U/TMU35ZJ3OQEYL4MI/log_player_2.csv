Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't accept such a significant drop. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  However, considering the true value of this product, I propose a price of $1,600,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you get this asset.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I believe this is a fair compromise, as it's more than what I'm willing to pay elsewhere, and it's a significant decrease from your previous offer."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
