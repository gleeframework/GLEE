"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it would be a significant asset to you.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value of the product to both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't accept such a significant drop. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000, which represents a substantial increase from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product fairly.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  However, considering the true value of this product, I propose a price of $1,600,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you get this asset.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I believe this is a fair compromise, as it's more than what I'm willing to pay elsewhere, and it's a significant decrease from your previous offer.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
