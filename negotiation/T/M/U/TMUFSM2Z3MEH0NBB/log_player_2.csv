"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it provides significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, but Alice is offering it for $130. This is a good deal, but you can likely get it for less.  By rejecting the offer, you can start a negotiation to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $115? "", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $115 is a bit too low for me, I could be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $122 is a good price and closer to your desired price point, you can likely still get a better deal by rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate. You've already shown Alice that you're willing to walk away, which gives you leverage.  Let's see if we can get closer to your target price."
