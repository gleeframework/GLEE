"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
