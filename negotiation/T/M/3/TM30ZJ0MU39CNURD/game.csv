"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This price is still beneficial to you and allows for a comfortable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still represents a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a good middle ground for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
