{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This price is still beneficial to you and allows for a comfortable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still represents a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum price of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you could potentially get the product from John for $1,200,000 if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a good middle ground for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  Let's settle on $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and it's a price that both of us can agree on. I'm confident you'll find this to be a good deal.
