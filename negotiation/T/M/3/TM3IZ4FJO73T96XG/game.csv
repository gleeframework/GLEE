"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12000 for the product. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than you're willing to go, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $11500 for the product. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to offer $11000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving any value on the table. I can offer you a price of $11250, and I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services that will be worth $500 to you. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
