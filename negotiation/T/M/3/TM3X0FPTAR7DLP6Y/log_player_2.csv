"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is significantly closer to your maximum budget of $1,200,000 than Alice's estimated value of $800,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's a clear gap for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price.
* **No need to rush:** You have 10 rounds to reach a deal, so there's no urgency to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Starting with a lower price puts pressure on Alice to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  The counteroffer is well below Alice's asking price, and is a reasonable starting point.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This offer leaves room for back-and-forth negotiation to find a mutually agreeable price within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very confident in the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $850,000 is still closer to your maximum budget than her estimated value.
* **Further negotiation possible:** You have several rounds left, so there's still potential to get a better price. 
* **No immediate need:** You can afford to keep negotiating without having to immediately accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $800,000. This is a fair price considering your estimated value and my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice's Value:**  $800,000 aligns with Alice's estimated value of the product, showing that you're being reasonable and willing to meet her halfway.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  This offer is closer to Alice's previous counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise and move towards a deal.
* **Pressure to Accept:**  By offering close to her value, you're putting pressure on Alice to accept your offer rather than risk losing the deal and potentially receiving a lower price in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up on the extra $20,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $825,000 is a good price for you. It's significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and is within a reasonable range of Alice's estimated value.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  Alice has already indicated this is the lowest she's willing to go, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or her withdrawing the offer altogether.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  You've already rejected several offers, and Alice may become less willing to negotiate in future rounds. It's better to accept this good offer rather than risk having to buy from John at a much higher price."
