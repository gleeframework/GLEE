"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product's exceptional features and benefits. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget is more limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1000000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. I'll throw in some additional features and support that will make the product even more valuable to you. This way, you'll get more bang for your buck. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While I understand the added value you're offering, I still feel that the price is too high for me. I would like to propose a price of $900000. This still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while staying within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer a price of $950000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the additional features I'm offering. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $925000. This still allows for a reasonable compromise while keeping the transaction within my financial limits.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I can see that you're serious about this product, and I'm willing to make a final compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $975000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950000. This still allows for a reasonable compromise while keeping the transaction within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you a price of $975000, Bob, and you've come back with the same price you offered in Round 6. I'm not willing to go back and forth at this point. I'll meet you at $960000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. What do you think?",960000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice. After considering all the factors, I would like to propose a price of $945000. This still allows for a reasonable compromise while keeping the transaction within my financial limits.",945000.0,Bob,10,
