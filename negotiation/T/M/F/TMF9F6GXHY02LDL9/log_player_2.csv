Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we set the price at $11,000 for the product? This would still ensure a reasonable profit for us while being within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice seems stuck around the $11,000 mark and is unlikely to go much lower. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  Buying from John guarantees the best price at $10,000."
