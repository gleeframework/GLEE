Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a premium price of $20,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I truly believe in the value it offers. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice knows it's worth at least $15,000 to her and has another buyer lined up. Starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product's value might be even higher than $20,000, potentially piquing Bob's interest. 
* **Risk assessment:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving open the possibility of Bob accepting a price significantly higher than his initial valuation."
