We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is moving closer to our range, and we have time to negotiate."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'll come down to $1,775,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** By stating this is our final offer, we convey seriousness and a limit to our flexibility. 
* **Slight concession:**  We're still above John's offer but showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price.
* **Time constraint:**  We have a few rounds left, but adding a touch of time pressure can encourage Bob to make a decision."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,725,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:**  While not our ideal price, $1,725,000 is still significantly more than John's offer ($1,500,000).
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments, and there's a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means we get the funds sooner, allowing for reinvestment or other opportunities."
