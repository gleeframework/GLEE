"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $180 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  I'm aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer. Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer allows room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message maintains a friendly tone and suggests my counteroffer is a genuine starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $120? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $120 is better than her initial offer, it's still significantly above my $80 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice is showing willingness to negotiate by coming down in price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can meet somewhere closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $120 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $75?  That would work much better for my budget."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to compromise.
* **Staying Within Budget:** My $75 offer is still comfortably below my $80 limit.
* **Explaining My Constraints:** By mentioning my budget, I'm hoping Alice understands my position better and is more likely to negotiate within that range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $75, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That would be a significant discount from my initial price, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress is good, but not good enough:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $100 is a tempting offer. However, it's still $20 above my ideal price.
* **Leverage Time:**  We still have rounds to go. I'll politely decline and propose a counter-offer closer to my limit, hoping Alice will continue to move towards a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $100 is close, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $80. How about we settle at $85? That's a fair bit closer to your last offer."",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making a final push towards my price limit. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating my willingness to meet her closer to the middle ground. 
* **Urgency:** By framing this as a potential ""settlement,"" I'm suggesting it's a final offer, encouraging Alice to seriously consider it."
