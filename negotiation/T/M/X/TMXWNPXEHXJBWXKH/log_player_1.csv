Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential compromise. It's also significantly higher than John's offer, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It's a good starting point for further negotiation, and it still reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my bottom line that it's worth accepting.  It's a better price than John's offer and still generates a decent profit."
