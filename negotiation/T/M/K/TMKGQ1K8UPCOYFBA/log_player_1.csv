Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it valuable. What do you say to a price of $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($120) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering a price of $100 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value but still allows you to profit significantly. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By stating that the offer is being made to Bob ""first,"" it implies that the product might not be available for long, potentially encouraging him to accept."
