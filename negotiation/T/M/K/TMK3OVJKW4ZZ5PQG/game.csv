"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. Let's find a middle ground.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. ",9500.0,Alice,5,
