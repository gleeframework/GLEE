"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, how about we consider a price of $17,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle.  While I see the value in the product, $17,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we possibly settle around $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,000 is lower than I'd like to go. Could we make it work at $15,500? That's a significant discount from my original offer and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,250?",14250.0,Bob,6,
