"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $120, there's a good chance he'll accept this offer. If he doesn't, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $110.  We still have many rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $102, I'm only $2 away from my minimum and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to $105 to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer,  bringing us closer to a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get a little more, Bob's offer is getting too close to John's offer.  I'm going to sell to John to guarantee a sale and avoid risking further negotiation that could lead to a lower price."
