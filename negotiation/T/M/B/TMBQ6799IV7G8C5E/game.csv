"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm willing to be flexible, I have to be mindful of the true value of this product. Could you consider $1,110,000? This is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure you see a strong return, but I also need to be compensated fairly.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
