"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to consider a price closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $12,500. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we settle on $11,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and a good deal for me. ",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $13,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price than my previous offers.",13000.0,Alice,5,
