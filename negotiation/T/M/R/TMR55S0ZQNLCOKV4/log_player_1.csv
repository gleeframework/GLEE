Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  Let's try to make a deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

Bob seems firmly rooted at $10,000 and is unlikely to budge. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
