"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $2000000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value will far exceed that in the long run.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1000000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This is a significant compromise, but I believe it reflects the product's potential value. Let's see if we can find common ground here.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer the product for $1600000.
