"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below what I know Bob is willing to pay, but still significantly above my minimum. This should give me some room to negotiate while also demonstrating my serious interest in closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a lower price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,200,000.  It's also a decent compromise from my initial offer and gives us both room to negotiate further if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can do better.  We have several rounds remaining, and I'm not in a hurry to settle.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,125,000.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward while staying within a range that I believe is still fair to both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it is tempting to take it, I'm only halfway through the rounds and I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping to get a better offer from Bob before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1110000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $1,110,000.  I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. It's closer to his last offer, but still significantly above my minimum.  I hope this shows him that I'm willing to compromise while also making sure I get a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept, I'm running out of time. I'm only two rounds away from having to decide between accepting Bob's offer or selling to John. I'm going to try one last counteroffer to see if I can push Bob to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000, hoping to meet Bob halfway.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the final round, and I have to make a decision. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,095,000 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than what John is offering and more than my minimum. It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
