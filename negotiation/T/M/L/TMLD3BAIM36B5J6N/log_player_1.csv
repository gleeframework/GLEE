"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This shows I'm confident in the product's worth while also demonstrating willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, given that the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility.  This counteroffer is still a good price for me, and I believe it's within a range Bob is likely to accept, given his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I believe Bob might be willing to go a little higher, especially if he wants to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with this offer.  It's a good compromise and shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but still allows me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only $500 more than what John would pay, it's better than risking the deal falling through completely.  The remaining rounds are limited, and it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer further."
