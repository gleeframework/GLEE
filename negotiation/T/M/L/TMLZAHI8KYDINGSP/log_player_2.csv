"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $850,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if we can get a better price. $850,000 is above my budget, and I have 9 more rounds to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000, but I'm willing to come down to $810,000 to make the deal work. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price.  $810,000 is still a little higher than what I'm hoping for, but it's a good compromise."
