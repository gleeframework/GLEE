}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. He's consistently been below the $1,000,000 mark. Accepting his $950,000 offer means a $250,000 loss compared to selling to John.  It's strategically better to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
