Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $11,000. I believe it offers tremendous value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 is a strategic move. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still represents a ""saving"" and might tempt him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,000, there's some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.  You can always come down a bit, knowing you have John as a backup."
