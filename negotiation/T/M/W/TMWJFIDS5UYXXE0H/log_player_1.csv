"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it's not so high that it seems unreasonable to Bob right off the bat.  I'll see how he reacts and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is a good price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to be flexible, but it's still closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although it's still not my ideal price, it's getting closer, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  It's not worth risking losing this deal altogether just for a few hundred dollars more."
