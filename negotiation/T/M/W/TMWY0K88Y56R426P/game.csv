"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $115 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $105? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $105 isn't quite working for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
