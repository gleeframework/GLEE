"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $90 is a better deal than buying from John for $100, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can offer you a compromise at $92, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $92 is still a better deal than buying from John, Bob is trying to save as much as possible. Rejecting Alice's offer again allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $92 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $88?"", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $88, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $92. How about $90? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is the same as her initial offer. While Bob could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower. Accepting the offer at $90 saves Bob $10 compared to buying from John, and still gives him a good deal considering the product is worth $100 to him.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
