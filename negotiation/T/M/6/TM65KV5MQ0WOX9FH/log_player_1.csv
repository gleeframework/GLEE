This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for potential concessions. The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, based on my current budget and valuation, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. Would you be open to discussing a lower price, perhaps closer to $1800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you ideally want.  You should reject his offer and counter with a price closer to your initial offer.  It shows you're willing to negotiate, but also that you believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we settle at $1,900,000? This price still reflects the significant value of the product and would be a great investment for your business. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I believe we could find a mutually beneficial price closer to $1750000. This would allow me to acquire the product without straining my budget too much. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still not ideal. You should continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still room for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I value your interest, $1,750,000 is still a bit below what I can reasonably accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get the product and me to get a satisfactory price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort in trying to reach an agreement. I'm willing to consider $1800000 as a compromise, which is slightly higher than my initial offer but still within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer is $1,800,000, which is above your minimum of $1,500,000. This is a good deal considering you have a backup option with John who's willing to pay $1,500,000. Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but it's not guaranteed and could risk losing the deal altogether."
