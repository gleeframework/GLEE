"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $2000000. This is a fair price considering its unique value.  I believe it would be a great asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, based on my current budget and valuation, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. Would you be open to discussing a lower price, perhaps closer to $1800000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we settle at $1900000? This price still reflects the significant value of the product and would be a great investment for your business. What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I believe we could find a mutually beneficial price closer to $1750000. This would allow me to acquire the product without straining my budget too much. I look forward to your response.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I value your interest, $1750000 is still a bit below what I can reasonably accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1850000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get the product and me to get a satisfactory price. Let me know what you think.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort in trying to reach an agreement. I'm willing to consider $1800000 as a compromise, which is slightly higher than my initial offer but still within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
