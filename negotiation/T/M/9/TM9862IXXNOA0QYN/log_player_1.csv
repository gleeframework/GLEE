"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, knowing Bob values the product at $150. This leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135,  meeting Bob halfway from his offer of $130. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has stuck with his offer of $130.  While I would prefer more, it's clear he's unlikely to go higher.  At this point, $130 is better than selling to John for $100 and still allows me to make a profit."
