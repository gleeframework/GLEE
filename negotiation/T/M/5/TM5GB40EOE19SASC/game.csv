"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,200,000. This reflects the true worth of what the product offers.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is simply outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product goes far beyond your initial offer.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too much for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my part and a fair price for the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This offer reflects the significant value the product brings and keeps us moving towards a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value I see in the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, your commitment to finding a solution is appreciated. Let's bridge this gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,450,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to reach a price that fits my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's see if we can close the gap.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
