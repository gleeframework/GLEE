"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let you have it for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $140 is getting close to your max, but there's still room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly. It's a starting point for further negotiation, and we can always adjust upwards if Alice completely rejects this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $130, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. Let's try one more time to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

We're pushing our luck a bit here, aiming for the price Alice values the product at.  However, it's a firm but fair offer. If she rejects this, we can always accept her previous offer of $130, which is still a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $130, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice met you halfway, and you're saving $25 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and finalize the purchase."
