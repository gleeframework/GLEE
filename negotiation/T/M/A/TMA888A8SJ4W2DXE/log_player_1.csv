Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable value.  
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  A price of $1,000,000 is closer to my goal than Bob's offer.
* **Encourage counteroffer:** It's likely Bob will counter with a lower price, allowing for further negotiation.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I have a backup option with John, so I'm not desperate to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed offer from John.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is $75,000 higher than Bob's initial offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise but maintains a good portion of my desired profit margin.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing compromise to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Strategic Goal:**  By offering a slightly higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer, I hope to entice him into a new round of negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm still looking to keep the price lower. I would like to propose $875,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has slightly increased his offer to $875,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Bob might not budge further, and I could end up settling for a price much lower than I would like.  However, I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm not yet ready to give up on a better deal.

**Next Steps:**  I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. However, $875,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down a little further to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing my offer by $25,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing fairness and using ""both of us"" to encourage a win-win scenario.
* **Strategic Goal:**  I'm hoping to close the gap in price and get closer to my target value while still maintaining a strong negotiation position. By offering $900,000, I'm making a significant concession, but I'm confident that I can still get a better deal than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $890,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope this meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $890,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made significant concessions and there's a risk that Bob won't budge further.  

At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $1,200,000, securing a guaranteed profit and avoiding the potential for further negotiation that might result in a lower price."
