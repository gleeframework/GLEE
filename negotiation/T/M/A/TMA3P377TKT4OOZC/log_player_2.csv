"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

This is a much higher price than Bob's limit.  It's best to reject and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
``` 

Bob is going to start with a lowball offer, but one that isn't completely unreasonable.  This should give Alice some room to bargain while still keeping the price within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still too high. There's room to negotiate further. Bob should reject and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

Bob is going to raise his offer a bit, showing Alice he's serious about buying but still pushing for a price closer to his limit.  This should keep the negotiation moving towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although the price is getting closer, Bob still has room to bargain.  He can likely get it lower and shouldn't settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

Bob is going to offer a price halfway between his last offer and Alice's offer.  This shows that he's willing to compromise and hopefully will get Alice to meet in the middle."
