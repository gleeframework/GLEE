# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($12,000 < $15,000).**
* **It's cheaper than buying from John ($12,000 < $15,000).**
* **While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, the risk of losing the deal is higher than the potential savings.** 

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John."
