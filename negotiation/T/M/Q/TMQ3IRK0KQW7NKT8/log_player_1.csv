Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize profit while still being appealing to Bob:

* **High but not too high:** $14,000 is significantly less than Bob's perceived value ($15,000), giving him a strong incentive to accept.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob and presenting the price as ""fair"" makes it more palatable. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While this is a strong offer, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, potentially increasing the profit even further."
