Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get out of this product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before accepting."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer.  However, $750,000 is below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated for the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product, and it's still a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
