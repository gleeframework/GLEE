"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it can be a real asset to your business. I'm asking for $900000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get out of this product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer.  However, $750000 is below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated for the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $850000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product, and it's still a good compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
