"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1100000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1050000 is getting closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Given my previous offer and the fact that I'm very close to my limit,  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.  ",950000.0,Bob,6,
