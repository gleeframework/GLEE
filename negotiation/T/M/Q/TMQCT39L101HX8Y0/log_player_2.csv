"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $100. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:**  We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still comfortably above her perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation while signaling we're serious buyers.
* **Polite and Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and respectful tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Clear Counteroffer:**  We clearly state our desired price, avoiding vague language that could prolong the process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate.  Her offer of $95 is still above the midpoint between our previous offer ($85) and her initial offer ($100). There's a good chance we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $90? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price directly in the middle of our previous offer ($85) and her current offer ($95). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" reinforces the idea that we're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Clear and Concise:** We maintain a direct and straightforward approach, clearly stating our desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I can do $92, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Potential Savings:** At this point, Alice is only $7 away from our target price.  The potential savings from further negotiation are minimal.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Alice has indicated that $92 is her lowest price.  Pushing further might lead to her ending the negotiation, forcing us to buy from John at $120.
* **Good Overall Deal:**  $92 is significantly lower than our maximum budget and a decent compromise from both sides."
