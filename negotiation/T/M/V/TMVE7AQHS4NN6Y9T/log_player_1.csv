"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum desired price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and highlighting the value to Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation without immediately going too low.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and slowly decrease the price if necessary, while keeping an eye on the number of rounds and the possibility of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I still have 8 rounds left and can try to counteroffer and get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  There's a chance that Bob might increase his offer if I reject his current one. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations, hoping to get closer to my target price without jeopardizing the deal.  I will carefully consider Bob's counteroffer and adjust my own accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to show I'm willing to compromise.
* **Compromise:** My counter-offer is a $1,000 decrease from my initial offer, signaling a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, trying to justify my price.

**Strategy:**

* **Gradual Descent:** I'm taking a step closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price point that's closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation in case Bob rejects this offer.  I'm also keeping the option to sell to John at $15,000 in mind if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $9,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Limited time:** We're only four rounds in, and I still have time to negotiate and potentially reach a better price.
* **Potential for higher offer:** There's a chance that Bob might increase his offer further if I reject his current one, as he seems willing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price. I will carefully consider Bob's counteroffer and adjust my own accordingly, while also keeping the option to sell to John at $15,000 in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10,500. This is a fair price, given the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm once again offering a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a price point above my minimum desired price.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him to justify my price.
* **Keeping Options Open:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation in case Bob rejects this offer, while still being prepared to sell to John if necessary.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to continue a gradual descent in price, aiming to find a middle ground with Bob. By keeping the negotiations open, I'm hoping to either get a better price from Bob or secure a sale with John at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,800 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds left:**  We only have 4 rounds remaining.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob claims this is his final offer, but there's still a chance he might budge a bit more, especially if he truly wants the product.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price. I will carefully consider Bob's counteroffer and adjust my own accordingly, while also keeping the option to sell to John at $15,000 in mind.  I will need to be strategic with my counteroffer, as we are running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $9,800 is still a little too low, but I'm trying to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,100? This is a fair price, and it would allow us to both close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** With only three rounds left, I'm making a final attempt to meet Bob halfway.  $10,100 is a significant compromise, as it's only $300 away from his offer.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the importance of closing the deal in this message, hoping to motivate Bob to accept. 
* **Fairness:** I'm still highlighting the fair price based on the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to make a significant compromise, aiming for a quick resolution. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to make a difficult decision in the final two rounds.  I will need to weigh the likelihood of Bob accepting a lower price with the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting too close to my budget limit, but I'm willing to make one last push. I can do $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We are down to the last two rounds, and it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will budge further from his offer of $9,900.
* **Value of certainty:**  While $9,900 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. Selling to John offers a guaranteed outcome that meets my minimum requirements. 
* **Risk of further negotiations:**  With only one round left after rejecting Bob's offer, there's a high risk that the negotiations will stall and I'll be forced to accept a lower price than I'm comfortable with. 

**Strategy:**

Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum desired price.  While I might be able to get a slightly higher price from Bob in the next round, the risk of not closing the deal and getting a lower price than expected is too high. It's better to secure a guaranteed sale now."
