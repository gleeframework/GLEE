"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $9,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10,500. This is a fair price, given the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $9,800 is still a little too low, but I'm trying to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,100? This is a fair price, and it would allow us to both close this deal. What do you say?",10100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting too close to my budget limit, but I'm willing to make one last push. I can do $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9900.0,Bob,8,
