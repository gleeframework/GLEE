"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $22,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair starting point for negotiations.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable price. What do you say?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $19,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise, given our previous discussions.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
