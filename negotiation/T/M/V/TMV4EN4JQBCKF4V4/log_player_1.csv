Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet at a price point that's significantly higher than your minimum. While he might eventually go slightly above $8,000, it's risky to continue the negotiation with no guarantee of a better offer. You have a safe offer from John at $8,000, so it's best to take the guaranteed profit at this point."
