"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap. ",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $15,000 again, as that is the maximum I can afford. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
