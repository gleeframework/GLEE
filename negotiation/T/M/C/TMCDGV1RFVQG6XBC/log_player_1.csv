"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000. I know it's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $15,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.
* I have 9 rounds left, so I can afford to be a bit more strategic and attempt to push for a higher price.  
* By rejecting the offer, I keep the negotiation open and have a chance to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap. "", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $15,000 again, as that is the maximum I can afford. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob has made it clear that he is unwilling to go higher than $15,000. 
* I've already counter-offered once, and I'm running out of rounds to negotiate.
* John is offering my minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing me a sale at my floor price. 
* While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of continuing with Bob and getting no deal outweighs the potential gain of a slightly higher price."
