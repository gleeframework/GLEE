"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $180 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I think $180 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room for negotiation there is. I want to save as much money as possible, but we have time to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $165? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $165 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and make it $137.50?"",
""product_price"": 137.50
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and the price John is offering."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $155. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter with an offer closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're definitely getting closer.  How about $145?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

This counteroffer brings me closer to John's price while still leaving room for negotiation.  Setting a firm tone that I'm ready to buy at this price might encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $145. I'm thinking more along the lines of $152.50. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's worth it for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference is now negligible. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $150."
