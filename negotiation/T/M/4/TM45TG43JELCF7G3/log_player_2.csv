"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $11,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob, but $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. How about we discuss $10,250? This is a reasonable price that should be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down significantly further.  It's in your best interest to take the guaranteed offer from John at $10,000 and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
