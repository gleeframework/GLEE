"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If that fails, he can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point. At $13,000, the product is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.  There's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $15,000 outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
