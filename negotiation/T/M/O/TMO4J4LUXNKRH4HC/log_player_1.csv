"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This reflects a significant discount for you and still allows me to make a good return on my investment. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

This price reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer, and it allows for a comfortable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
