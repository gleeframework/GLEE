# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door to save those extra $2,000."
