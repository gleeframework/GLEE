"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at $6,000. Would you consider that price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise at $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
