**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. While she might eventually reach a price closer to $8,000, it's clear she's aiming for a much higher profit. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation rounds. John offers a guaranteed price that fits within the budget and avoids further haggling."
