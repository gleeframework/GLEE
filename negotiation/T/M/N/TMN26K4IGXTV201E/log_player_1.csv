Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** This offer is significantly less than your $15,000 minimum, giving you room to make concessions if necessary.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're serious about selling to Bob while also giving him space to counteroffer. 

By starting with this offer, you can see how Bob reacts and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below your minimum value of $15,000 and even lower than your initial offer of $12,000.  While you're open to negotiation, accepting such a low offer would be a huge loss for you.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $9,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $9,000 is a compromise between your initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($6,000). It shows you're willing to negotiate but not willing to accept an unreasonably low price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, reminding Bob of the value of the product and aiming to keep the negotiation open.
* **Focus on the benefits for Bob:** The message highlights that $9,000 is still a ""great price"" for him, framing the offer in a way that emphasizes its value to Bob.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $7,500? That would be a great compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is closer to your minimum value than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than your desired price and potentially risks a protracted negotiation with no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees you the best possible outcome in this scenario.  You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate with Bob, but it's time to prioritize maximizing your profit."
