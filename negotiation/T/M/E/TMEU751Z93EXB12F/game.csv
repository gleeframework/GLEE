"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? I'm confident you'll find the product worth that price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close a deal at that price.",8250.0,Bob,4,
