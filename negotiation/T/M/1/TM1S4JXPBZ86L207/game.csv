"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value the product holds, and it's a price point that I believe works for both of us. Let me know if this is something you're open to.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your desire to get closer to your initial asking price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can consider it.",800000.0,Bob,4,
