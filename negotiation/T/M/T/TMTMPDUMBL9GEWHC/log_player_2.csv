"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  You can get the product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy."
