``` 

This offer starts at a high price that leaves room for negotiation, but it's still below Bob's maximum value. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a better agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than John's offer, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my final offer. I'd like to see if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my initial asking price, it's higher than John's offer, and it seems like Bob is serious about this price.  Further negotiation might take too much time, and I'm confident that I can make a profit with this deal."
