"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* $950,000 is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but also lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.
* This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate and allows me to assess his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth.  
* I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get closer to my ideal price if I continue negotiations.
* Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer in the next round, keeping the negotiation moving towards a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it above Bob's counteroffer. 
* This shows flexibility while remaining firm on my desire for a higher price.
* $900,000 represents a good compromise and might be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer remains the same, and although it's a decent price, I'm still holding out for a better deal.
* I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get closer to my ideal price with a few more rounds of negotiation.
* Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  This is a significant concession, showing a willingness to compromise while remaining firm on getting more than John's offer.
*  $875,000 is still a good deal for me, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is really unwilling to go higher. 
*  This approach aims to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and potentially secure a deal before the time limit runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount yet.
* There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price.
* By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's last offer was too low, but I'm willing to meet him halfway at $850,000.
* This offer is still significantly higher than John's offer, making it a good deal for me.
*  I'm running out of time, but this counteroffer shows a strong willingness to compromise and hopefully encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* We are down to the last two rounds, and the negotiation hasn't been productive.  Bob keeps offering increasingly lower prices, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
* While I would prefer to get closer to $850,000, the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and ending up with only John's $800,000 offer is too high.
* Therefore, selling to John now guarantees me $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a safe outcome given the current situation."
