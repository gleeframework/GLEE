Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$80 is far too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $110. I believe this is a fair offer considering my minimum value and Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. I've already made multiple concessions, and Bob's counteroffers are only increasing by $5 each time.  It seems like we're stuck in a stalemate.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's not ideal, but it's a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
