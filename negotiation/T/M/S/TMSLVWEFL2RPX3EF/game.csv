"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  I'm open to negotiation but need to see movement on your end. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to close this deal quickly.",975000.0,Bob,4,
