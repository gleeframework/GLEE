"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and allows room to make concessions if needed. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium.  Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject this offer and counter with a lower price in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on a price that's closer to my initial value.  I'm hoping this move will encourage Bob to accept the deal, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already reached round 4, and there's a chance we might not reach an agreement.  It's a risk to keep negotiating.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price. I'll take the safe option and sell to John."
