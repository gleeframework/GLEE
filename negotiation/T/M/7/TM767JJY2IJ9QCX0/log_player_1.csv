Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering the product at $95, which is a fair price that leaves room for negotiation but also gives me a decent profit. I'm confident that Bob will be interested, as the product is worth $100 to him.  This gives me some leverage if he wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum price of $80.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering at $90. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit while remaining attractive to Bob.  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $87.50? That's the lowest I can go, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $87.50 is still above my minimum and  it's likely that Bob won't budge further. Accepting this offer is the best option to maximize my profit in this situation."
