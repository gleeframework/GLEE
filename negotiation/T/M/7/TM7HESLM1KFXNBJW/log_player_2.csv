# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Although $100 is less than the product's worth to you ($120), you know you can get a better deal from John for $80."
