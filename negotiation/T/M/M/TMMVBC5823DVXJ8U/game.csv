"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $90.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a little higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to pay $95, and I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $98. It's still a great value, and I think you'll be happy with the purchase.",98.0,Alice,5,
