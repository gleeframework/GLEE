"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above my budget of $12,000.  There's no point in accepting this offer. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, $12,000 is significantly below my bottom line. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, $16,000 is still above my budget. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go higher than $12,000.  It's my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
