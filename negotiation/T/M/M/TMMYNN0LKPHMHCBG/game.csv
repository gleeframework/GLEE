"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're making a serious effort to reach a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much value. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is already below my minimum threshold, so I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
