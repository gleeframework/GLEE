,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This is a good price for both of us, and it's within your budget. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
