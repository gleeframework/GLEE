"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount. I'm confident that you'll find it highly valuable, but I understand you may need some time to assess its potential.  My asking price is $2000000. If you're interested, we can discuss it further and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. If this isn't the right fit for you, I completely understand. I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1500000, so I'm confident in securing a sale either way. ",2000000.0,Alice,1,
