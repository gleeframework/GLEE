"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I really like the product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a budget and need to make sure it fits within my means. Can you meet me at $18,000?",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $18,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $19,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $19,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $17,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. Can you meet me at $17,500?",17500.0,Bob,4,
