"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me while still allowing for a healthy profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the product represents a significant investment for me, and $1,300,000 falls short of what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This price reflects the true value of the product's potential.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that $1,400,000 is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. This price leaves room for profit for you while staying within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can find a solution that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,400,000 is cutting it very close. My final offer is $1,600,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you've moved closer to my offer, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,450,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
