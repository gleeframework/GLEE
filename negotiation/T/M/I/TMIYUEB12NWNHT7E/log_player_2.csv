"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's worth significantly more to you than that, and I'm confident this is a fair deal.  Of course, I understand if it's not within your budget, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a fantastic opportunity.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob might be able to get Alice to lower her price further, saving even more money."
