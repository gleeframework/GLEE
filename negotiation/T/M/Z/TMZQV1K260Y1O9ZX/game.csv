"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand you have a budget. While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $10,000? This is still a good deal for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and you to get a valuable product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,
