"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
