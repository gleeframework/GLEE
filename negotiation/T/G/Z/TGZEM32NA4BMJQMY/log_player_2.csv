Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $102. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your $80 limit. You've tried to negotiate but it seems Alice is not willing to go any lower. You've already gone through several rounds, and it's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a price you're comfortable with.  It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John."
