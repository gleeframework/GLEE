"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and save you some money. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. How about we meet in the middle at $950000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you compared to what it's worth to me.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still a bit away from your ideal price, but I'm not willing to go above $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $925000 is my maximum. Can you consider this offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
