Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, making it appealing to Bob.  
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win, highlighting the value Bob gets and keeping the tone positive.  

**Strategy:**

By offering a price lower than my minimum, I'm incentivizing Bob to engage in negotiations. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a price that's closer to my ideal. 

**Important:** This is just the first offer. I'll be ready to adjust based on Bob's response, using my knowledge of the product's worth to me and John's offer as a reference point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and save you some money. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'm holding out for a better price, especially considering John is willing to pay my full minimum.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Make a counteroffer:**  I can try to push for a price closer to $1,000,000, potentially even using John's offer as leverage.
* **Gain more information:** By rejecting, I can see if Bob is truly willing to go higher.  

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer, aiming for a price between $900,000 and $1,000,000.  
* If Bob rejects again, I'll assess whether to keep negotiating with him or just sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you compared to what it's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $950,000 is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the ""middle ground"" aspect, making it seem like a fair solution. I'm also subtly reminding him that even at this price, he's getting a good deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Test the waters:** I'm gauging how far Bob is willing to go, trying to get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting his offer immediately, I'm showing that I'm not desperate and have other options (John's offer).

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good result. 
* If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to keep negotiating or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still a bit away from your ideal price, but I'm not willing to go above $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $925000 is my maximum. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's getting closer, the potential for further negotiation seems slim. Given that John is willing to pay my minimum, it makes more sense to accept his offer and secure a guaranteed higher profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and effort, without any guarantee of reaching a better price.
* **Risk aversion:** There's always the risk that Bob will not budge further, leaving me with a lower price or even no deal at all.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price, maximizing my profit and minimizing risk.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John is the most rational decision, as it offers the highest potential return and eliminates uncertainty and potential loss."
