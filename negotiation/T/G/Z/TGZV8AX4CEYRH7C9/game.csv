,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $95?  That's a good middle ground for us both, and I'm sure we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. How about $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.",105.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit above what I'm able to spend right now.  How about $98? It's closer to your last offer, but I'm still staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",98.0,Bob,6,,
