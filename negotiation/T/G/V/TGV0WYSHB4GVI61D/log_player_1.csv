Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's moved closer to my desired price, $875,000 is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $875,000 is still too low. I'm prepared to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob is not willing to budge much higher, and I'm running out of time.  John is a guaranteed sale at a much better price, so it's the most logical option."
