"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is well above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product but I can't go higher than $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product is a significant investment that holds more worth than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects its true value and potential. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's budget of $800,000. Even though this price is lower than her initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate for a better price. It's best to continue the negotiation and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value to me.  I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're at a bit of an impasse.  I'm very motivated to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $937,500? This would be a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $937,500 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000. While it's closer than previous offers, Bob is still not willing to pay that much.  He can continue to negotiate with Alice or choose to buy from John. Since Bob has already rejected Alice's offer, he is likely to continue negotiating with her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $937,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a good middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
