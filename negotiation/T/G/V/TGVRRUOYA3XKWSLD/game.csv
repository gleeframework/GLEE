"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product but I can't go higher than $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product is a significant investment that holds more worth than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects its true value and potential. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value to me.  I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're at a bit of an impasse.  I'm very motivated to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $937,500? This would be a fair compromise.",937500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $937,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a good middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
