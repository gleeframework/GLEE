"Alice, your initial offer of $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $12,000. I believe this is still a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $12,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this price represents a significant compromise and reflects the true value of this product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price that balances my budget and the value of the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
