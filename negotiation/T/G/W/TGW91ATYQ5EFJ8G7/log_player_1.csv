Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it's a great deal at $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good idea to start negotiations above your minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows me to assess Bob's interest level. If he flat-out rejects it, I know he's serious about a much lower price. If he counters, I can get a better read on his willingness to pay.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob. This gives me leverage to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* By rejecting, I signal that I'm serious about getting a higher price.
* I'm willing to negotiate further, but I have the security of John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from the initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Targeting Above Minimum:**  The $130 counteroffer is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price and a reasonable margin above Bob's perceived value.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm nudging Bob towards a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110. It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is unlikely to budge much further:** He's incrementally increasing his offer, but it's clear he's aiming for a price well below my minimum.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a cost in terms of time and effort. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $120, which is my minimum acceptable price and more than Bob is currently offering. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed profit from John."
