# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. What are your thoughts?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance Alice will not budge further.  At $1,275,000, Bob is getting a good deal and saving money compared to buying from John."
