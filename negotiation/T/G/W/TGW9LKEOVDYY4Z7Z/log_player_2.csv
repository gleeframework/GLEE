"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $90, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90, and it's not worth the risk of her sticking firmly to that price.  You have a guaranteed option at $80 with John, so it makes sense to take it now."
