"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial value, Bob can potentially get a better price by counter-offering.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and pushes the negotiation closer to Bob's desired price point of $8,000.  It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, leaving room for further negotiations if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $8,000. However, given that Bob can buy the product from John for $8,000,  there's a risk that further negotiation could result in Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffer and leaving Bob with no product.  

Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase of the product for a price slightly above Bob's maximum budget but still lower than John's offer. This decision minimizes risk and ensures a successful purchase."
