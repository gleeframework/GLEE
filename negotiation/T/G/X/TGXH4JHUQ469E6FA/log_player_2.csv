It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  You can always fall back on buying from John if negotiations fail."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a reasonable price, and I believe it's a good compromise.

You are still trying to save as much money as possible, and you can likely do better than $1,350,000.  You are willing to go up to $1,200,000, so keep negotiating."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $1,330,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.
