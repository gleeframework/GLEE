"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit.  I know the product is worth significantly less to Bob, but I'm hoping to get him to come up a bit. This also gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to that number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but not too much.  I believe $1,600,000 is a fair compromise given Bob's counteroffer. I'm still holding out for a higher price but showing some flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers, but $1,100,000 is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm going to stick to my strategy of trying to get closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm finally going to lower my offer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, but he's also shown he's not willing to go much higher. I'm hoping this will be the deal-breaker."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting increasingly persistent with his low offers, and the time is ticking. Although I'd prefer to make a profit closer to my initial goal, it's getting riskier to keep negotiating.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and it's better to be safe than sorry."
