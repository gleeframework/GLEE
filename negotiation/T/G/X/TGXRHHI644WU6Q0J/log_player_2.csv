"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  As a smart buyer, you want to see if you can get the price lower.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend around $8,500, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than buying from John and is closer to Bob's desired price range.  There's a chance Bob could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and losing the deal altogether is too high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
