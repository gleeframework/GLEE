Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value of the product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this stage. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it.  This reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However,  $825,000 is still a bit out of my range.
