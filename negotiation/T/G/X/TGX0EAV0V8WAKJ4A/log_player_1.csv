"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.  I'll be watching for his response to see if he's willing to even consider this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not going to accept this offer. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. This is a good compromise and shows flexibility in the negotiation. Hopefully, it will be enough to persuade Bob to consider buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a low price. While tempting, selling to John for $120 is the smarter choice. This ensures I reach my minimum acceptable price and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to try one more time to reach a compromise with Bob.  $90 is a fair price considering his initial offer of $75 and my minimum price of $120. If he rejects this, I'll go with John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. I've had several rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely he'll budge.  I'll take the sure thing and sell to John for $120."
