"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  You have no information about the product's value to Alice.  Rejecting and counteroffering gives you the opportunity to potentially get a better price. You also have the safety net of buying from John for the same price if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 33%.  This aggressive move serves several purposes:

* **Sets the Tone:** It shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and not just passively accepting her first offer.
* **Gains Information:**  Alice's reaction (accept or counter) will give you valuable insights into her bottom line. 
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, you have room to make a more moderate counteroffer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your counteroffer, but it's still above your ideal price. You have 7 rounds left and a fallback option with John, so there's no need to rush into a decision.  Rejecting and counteroffering again will give you more information about Alice's flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price while remaining within a reasonable range. It shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but are not willing to pay her initial asking price. 

By moving incrementally closer to her offer, you're also demonstrating a willingness to compromise, which could encourage her to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your desired price, but you're getting closer.  Continuing to reject and counteroffer gives you the best chance of getting a price closer to your target while also learning more about Alice's negotiating strategy.  You still have the backup option of buying from John if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's last offer while still giving you some room for further negotiation. You're demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but not at the expense of your desired price point.  

By remaining firm, you're increasing the pressure on Alice to make a concession in the next round. You also have the advantage of being able to walk away and buy from John if the negotiations fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering a price that is very close to your last counteroffer, and you only have 3 rounds left.  While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price is increasing. Accepting Alice's offer at this point ensures you get the product at a reasonable price, even if it's not your absolute ideal."
