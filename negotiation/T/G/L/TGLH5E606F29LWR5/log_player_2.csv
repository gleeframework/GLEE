# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price of $90. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $90.  This is a good deal, but I can likely get it for less. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  How about $85?  It's still a good price for you, and I'd be happy to take it off your hands."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has lowered her price to $87.50, which is still within my budget of $100 and closer to my desired price.  I'm happy to accept her offer and avoid further negotiation."
