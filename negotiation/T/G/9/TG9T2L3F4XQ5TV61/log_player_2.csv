"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than what the product is worth to you ($100).  It's also above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price point. This is a bold move, but it sets a clear expectation and forces Alice to consider if she's willing to sell for a price close to her cost."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $160 is still higher than what the product is worth to me, although it's closer to my budget.  I'm going to continue to try and negotiate a lower price. While John's offer is tempting, I still have a few rounds left to see if I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price. I'm willing to take a chance on the remaining rounds since John's offer is still available as a fallback."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but only slightly.  I'm showing Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still firm on my desired price point.  This also creates a bit of urgency as we only have four rounds left before I can move on to John."
