Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's value to Bob, he might not be willing to pay his maximum.  
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer. You might need to adjust your asking price to reach an agreement."
