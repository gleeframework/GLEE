"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value it brings. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to move closer to your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a good deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I think that's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.",12500.0,Bob,4,
