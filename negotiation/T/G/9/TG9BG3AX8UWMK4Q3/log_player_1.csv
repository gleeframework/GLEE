"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a high price, but leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a significant profit but also want to avoid losing the deal to John.  I'll be ready to counter-offer if Bob rejects my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still a reasonable starting point for negotiation. Selling to John right now would yield a lower profit than what I believe I can get from Bob with further negotiation.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but staying below my initial asking price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable deal. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. Selling to John right now would be a safe option, but I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll counter-offer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway with my offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while ensuring I still make a significant profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
