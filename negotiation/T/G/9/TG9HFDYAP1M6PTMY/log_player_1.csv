Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a bit above my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I want to see if I can get a better price than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $150 is my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I'd like to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It still gives me a profit but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $160. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and I'm happy to secure a sale for a price higher than John's offer."
