Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Close to Bob's value:** Offering it at $145 is just slightly above Bob's perceived value of $120. While it's unlikely he'll accept immediately, it might make him consider it, especially if the product offers features he needs. 
* **Backup plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150. This allows you to be firm with Bob and not settle for anything less than your desired profit margin."
