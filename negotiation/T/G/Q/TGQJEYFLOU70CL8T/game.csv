"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I think it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
