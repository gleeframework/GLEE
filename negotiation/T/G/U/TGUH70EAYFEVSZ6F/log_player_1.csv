Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since Bob values the product significantly higher than my minimum price and John's offer, I'm starting with a strong offer closer to his perceived value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I'm aiming high, the $12,000 offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit lower, still landing me a great deal. 
* **Clear and concise:** The message is straightforward, highlighting the product's value to Bob and presenting a clear price. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential to counter-offer."
