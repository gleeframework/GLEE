"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $112.50?",112.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to meet in the middle, but $112.50 is still too low for me.  How about we try $118.75? This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and it's getting closer to a deal.",118.75,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest with you, my budget is capped at $120. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to buy right now.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Bob,6,
