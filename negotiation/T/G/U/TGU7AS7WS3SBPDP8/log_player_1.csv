Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $13,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about $12,100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is slightly above my minimum. While I'd prefer more, it's a better deal than selling to John."
