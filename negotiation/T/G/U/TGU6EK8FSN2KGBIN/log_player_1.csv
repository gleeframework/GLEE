Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $13,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not comfortable with that, I'd be willing to meet you at $12,900. I'm trying to stay within my budget.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and while $12,900 is almost my minimum, it's still not ideal. John's offer of $15,000 is much closer to my desired price and ensures I get the best possible outcome. I've learned that sometimes it's better to walk away from a negotiation when it's not going in your favor and pursue other options."
