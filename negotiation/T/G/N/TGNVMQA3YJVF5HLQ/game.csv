"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I understand it might be worth less to you.  I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is too far below my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's the best I can offer right now.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775,000. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $775,000 is still not in the ballpark of what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm running out of time, and I'm determined to make this deal work. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, but this is my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal before it's too late.",800000.0,Alice,7,
