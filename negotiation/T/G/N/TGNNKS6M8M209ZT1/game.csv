,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8200, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $7800 for the product. Can you consider that price?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not quite there, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $8000, which is my minimum price. I think it's a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get close to my limit, Alice. I'd be willing to meet you at $7900. That's as low as I can go, but I'm really interested in making a deal. Can you consider that price?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $7900, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $8100, which is my absolute minimum. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really trying to make a deal, Alice, but $8100 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7800, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",7800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8000. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can throw in a special bonus package worth $200, which will make the total value of the deal $8200. This is my final offer. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus package offer, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $7800. I'm afraid I've reached my limit. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to walk away and consider other options.",7800.0,Bob,10,
