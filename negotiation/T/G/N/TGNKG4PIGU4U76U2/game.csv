I'm not sure if $170 is a good deal for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $145. Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $145. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
