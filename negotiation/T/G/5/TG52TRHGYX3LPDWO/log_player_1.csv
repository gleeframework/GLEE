{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $11,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000, giving you a good profit margin.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  $11,000 is still lower than what Bob values the product at, making it potentially attractive to him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

By starting with this offer, you have a good chance of getting a price close to your desired value while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves a smaller profit margin. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price.  By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and attempt to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is still lower than your initial goal, it's very close to it and a good compromise.  You've already rejected Bob's previous offers, and continuing to push for a higher price might risk losing the sale altogether.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
