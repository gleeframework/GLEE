"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice first. $115 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counteroffer aims to start the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  We're still a bit far from a price I'm fully comfortable with. I'll try to nudge her down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $97?  That's a fair bit closer to my budget."",
 ""product_price"": 97
}
```

We're splitting the difference here again, showing willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a good deal. We're getting close to a price where we might need to consider John's offer if Alice doesn't budge."
