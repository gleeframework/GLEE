"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $110. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $125. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your last offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $115. That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.",115.0,Bob,6,
