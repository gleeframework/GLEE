Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I have a few more rounds to work with, and I think I can still get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $9,000. How about $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I have a few more rounds left, and I want to see if I can get him to budge a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $9,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with something."", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's offers are getting closer, but they're still too low for me.  I've only got a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk ending up with a price that's significantly lower than what John is offering.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal."
