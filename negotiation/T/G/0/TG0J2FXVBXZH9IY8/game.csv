"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $9,000. How about $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $9,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with something.",9000.0,Alice,5,
