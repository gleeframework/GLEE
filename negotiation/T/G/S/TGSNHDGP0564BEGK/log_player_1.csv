Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but leave Bob feeling like he got a good deal.  A price too close to $1,500,000 might scare him off.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to own the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You acknowledge the product's value (""exclusive opportunity"", ""unique value"").
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is a significant profit margin for you while still saving Bob $150,000 compared to his valuation. 
* **Justification:**  You're not just throwing out a number. You frame it as a ""fair deal"" highlighting the ""benefits.""

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a two-way street. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or if you'd rather sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
