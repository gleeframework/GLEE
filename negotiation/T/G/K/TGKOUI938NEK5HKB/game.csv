"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,500 right now.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $10,750.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
