"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to closing this deal.  Let's find a common ground.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be frank, I need to get at least $1,090,000 out of this deal. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny and more for you.  Shall we settle on $1,090,000?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
