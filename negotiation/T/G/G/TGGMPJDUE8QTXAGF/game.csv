"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I've done my research and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to save a bit more money.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more money. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925000. This is a great compromise, considering its value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $910000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.",910000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $920000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $915000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",915000.0,Bob,6,
