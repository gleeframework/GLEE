"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would give us both a fair deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $9,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,700.  Would that be workable for you?",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $9,000? It's just a little more than your last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
