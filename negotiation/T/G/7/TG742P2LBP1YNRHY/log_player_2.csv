"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, but she's offering it for $1,200,000. That's a terrible deal for Bob. Rejecting the offer and starting negotiations is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

This is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, so it's a good starting point for negotiations.  Alice might counter, but hopefully, she'll see the value in closing the deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering the product for $1,000,000, which is still above Bob's maximum value. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  There are still rounds left, and Bob might be able to get the price down a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob is willing to pay a bit more, but only if Alice is serious about making a deal. This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise but is still committed to staying within his budget."
