"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000. I'm confident that you'll see the value in this product and be willing to pay top dollar for it. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1350000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $1375000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit below your target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think it's worth my while. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1380000. It's a small increase, but I believe it's worth it for the value this product will bring to you. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'm going to try to meet you at $1375000 again. I really like the product, but I have to stick to my budget. Can we do that?",1375000.0,Bob,6,
