Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a reason to negotiate, but it's still a significant discount for you. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially go lower if Bob counters, but you have a safety net with John's offer.

Remember, this is just the first step. You'll need to be prepared to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I believe we can reach a better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum value, you have a better option:

* **John's offer:** John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a much better deal for you. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to maintain leverage in the negotiation. You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price, potentially getting a better price than $850,000.

It's more strategic to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price or, in the worst-case scenario, sell to John for your minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $875,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's try to reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still being profitable for you.
* **Mid-point:** $875,000 is the midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a desire for a fair deal.
* **Finality:**  Mentioning that this is a final offer creates a sense of urgency and motivates Bob to consider your proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I believe we can still negotiate further. I am proposing a price of $860,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum:**  Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price ($800,000), but you have room to potentially get a better deal. 
* **John's offer:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is still on the table. It's a significantly higher price than Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can continue to negotiate and try to push for a higher price. 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still worth trying to get closer to your desired price or take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $860,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $870,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 870000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise further but still maintains a decent profit for you.
* **Midpoint again:** $870,000 is the midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a desire for a fair deal.
* **Finality:** Emphasizing that this is the final offer creates urgency and motivates Bob to accept.

This counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a better price than Bob's last offer while still maintaining the option to sell to John if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that $870,000 is slightly above my budget. I would like to propose a final price of $865,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $865,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $865,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalemate:**  Bob's offer is very close to your minimum acceptable price, but there's not much room for further negotiation. It's likely that you'll keep going back and forth with small increments, which is time-consuming and might not lead to a significantly better price.
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is still on the table, which is a much higher price than Bob's offer and well above your minimum desired price.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees you a significant profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

It's time to take the guaranteed profit and sell the product to John. The potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are not worth the risk of losing a much better deal."
