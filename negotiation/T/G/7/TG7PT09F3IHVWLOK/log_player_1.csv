{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to my initial offer, Bob has been firm and consistent in his valuation around $1,200,000. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit ($200,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away in future rounds.  Continuing to negotiate might backfire and lead to a worse outcome."
