"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the chance to buy this product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $105 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $95. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. ",100.0,Alice,5,
