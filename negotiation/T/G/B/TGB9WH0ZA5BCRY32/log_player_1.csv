{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair.  It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

This offer considers the following:

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting at $2,000,000 allows for negotiation room while aiming to maximize potential profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly implies reasons for the high price, even though Bob knows its actual worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and inquisitive (""What do you think?""), signaling a willingness to negotiate.

While we have a backup offer, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome."
