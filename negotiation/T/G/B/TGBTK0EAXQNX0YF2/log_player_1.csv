"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, just under Bob's perceived value, to see if I can get a quick deal. However, I'm aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob. There are still 8 rounds left and I can use that leverage to my advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still closer to my desired price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair middle ground and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and the risk of Bob walking away entirely is increasing.  $12,800 is still significantly better than John's offer and I can move on to other opportunities."
