"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  I'm offering the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let's work towards closing this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1 million. To bridge the gap, I'm offering the product for $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while also allowing me to secure a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
