"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. My initial price is $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. $1,000,000 is still above your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  I'm offering the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let's work towards closing this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is moving in the right direction, but $950,000 is still a bit too high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1 million. To bridge the gap, I'm offering the product for $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while also allowing me to secure a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not willing to go much lower than $975,000, and I am not willing to go higher than $900,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $800,000 to avoid further negotiations that are likely to be fruitless."
