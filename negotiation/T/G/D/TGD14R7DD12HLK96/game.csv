"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my minimum asking price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I believe this aligns more closely with its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop to $11,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my financial situation, I am unable to meet the $11,500 price point. Would you consider lowering your price further to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
