{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my minimum asking price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives him some incentive to negotiate but ensures you're not giving it away for too low.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still leaving room to negotiate if necessary and protect your minimum value.
* **It shows willingness to compromise:**  This creates a positive tone for the negotiation. 

By offering a slightly lower price than your minimum, you encourage Bob to accept, while leaving room for negotiation if he rejects. This allows for a good starting point in this strategic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I believe this aligns more closely with its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $10,000 is a decent amount, it's below my minimum value.  I need to try and secure a better price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  To ensure I get at least my minimum, I will sell the product to John for $15,000."
