"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  How about we settle at $875,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I still think the product is worth more than $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value you'll get from the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this simple - $900,000.  It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you agree.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad you're serious about closing the deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $915,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",915000.0,Alice,7,
