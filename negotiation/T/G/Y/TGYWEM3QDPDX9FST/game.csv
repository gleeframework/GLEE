"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a better price. However, $6000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8500? That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $7250 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $7750. This is a very fair price, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $7750. I'm willing to go up to $7500, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll make the purchase.",7500.0,Bob,6,
