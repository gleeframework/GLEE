Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  Let's make this work!

Alice's offer:

Alice has reached her bottom line and is unlikely to go lower. Accepting the offer at $8,000 gets you the product for a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
