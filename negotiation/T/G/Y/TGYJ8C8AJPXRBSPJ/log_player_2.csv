You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $140.  It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will go lower."

$135 is a good price, and it's closer to your ideal price than John's offer.  Let's take it."
