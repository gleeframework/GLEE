Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a good price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to compromise further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$16,000 is a good price and significantly higher than John's offer. It's getting closer to my desired price, and I'm not sure I can get much more out of Bob at this point.  I'm going to take this deal and avoid risking a lower offer from Bob in the next round."
