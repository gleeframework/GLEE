"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is below my bottom line. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $925,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",925000.0,Alice,3,
