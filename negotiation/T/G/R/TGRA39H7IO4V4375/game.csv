"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12500. I can offer you a compromise at $13500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping to get closer to $12500. How about we split the difference and go with $13000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13750? It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it!",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $13750 is still a bit too high. Let's try $13250. This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $13250, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13750 and $13250, so how about $13500? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",13500.0,Alice,7,
