"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for a price of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This allows me to set the tone for the negotiation and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll counter with a lower price in the next round, but I'm not willing to settle for his initial offer.  I still have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget constraints while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down a bit.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a genuine attempt to reach an agreement and will be more willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal and avoid any further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $900,000 target, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, and I'm not willing to risk that.  Additionally, with John as an alternative buyer, I'm assured of receiving my minimum price."
