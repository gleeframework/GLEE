"Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for a price of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget constraints while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal and avoid any further negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,4,
