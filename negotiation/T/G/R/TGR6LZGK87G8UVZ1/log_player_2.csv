"Round 1

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have budget constraints.  Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your budget constraints.  While $2,300,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  I'm ready to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,500,000? This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $1,500,000, which is her value for the product. She's unlikely to go any lower.  Since you can buy the product for $800,000 from John, continuing the negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a better deal. You maximize your savings by purchasing from John."
