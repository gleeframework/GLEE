"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have budget constraints.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your budget constraints.  While $2,300,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $1,800,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $1,200,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  I'm ready to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,500,000? This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
