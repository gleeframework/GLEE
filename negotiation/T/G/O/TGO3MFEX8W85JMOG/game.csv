"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm intrigued by the product, $2000000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it.  This is my maximum, but I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1000000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1500000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1500000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $1000000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $1500000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, so I'm counteroffering $1400000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
