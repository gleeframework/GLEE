Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but not exorbitantly high. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If not, I'm ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below the value of the product to me. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise, as it's still above my minimum acceptable price, but also closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will show I'm willing to negotiate and will lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $95.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and I'm happy to make the deal.  It's better than selling to John for $100 and saves the time and energy of further negotiation."
