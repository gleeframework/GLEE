"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd save $300,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **Even though you could potentially get a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with John, it's not guaranteed.** There's a risk that you won't be able to negotiate a price lower than $1,200,000 with John.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision to save money and ensure you get the product."
