"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire [product name] at a price that's fair for both of us. This product is worth a great deal to you, and I know you'll find it extremely valuable.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.  My price for the product is $1,000,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000. However, it's still significantly more than Alice's perceived value of the product ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal and might encourage her to lower the price closer to her valuation."
