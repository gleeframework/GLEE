""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a unique chance to acquire an asset that aligns perfectly with your needs."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it at $950,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal (saving $50,000) while still maximizing your potential profit (earning $150,000 over John's offer).

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to strike a balance between:

* **Securing the sale:**  A price too close to $1,000,000 might discourage Bob.
* **Maximizing your gain:** A price too close to $800,000 leaves potential profit on the table."
