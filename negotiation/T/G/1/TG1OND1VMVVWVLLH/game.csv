"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows for a fair profit for me. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise that hopefully allows us to both walk away happy.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession. $10,750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $10,900.  This is my best offer, and I hope you'll accept it. If you don't, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground.  While $10,900 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to go up to $10,800. This is a fair price, and I believe it allows both of us to come to a good agreement.",10800.0,Bob,6,
