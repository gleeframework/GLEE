Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are incrementally increasing and it seems unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the guaranteed offer from John."
