"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,500 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little bit, but $11,500 is still too high for me.  To be honest, I'm working with a maximum budget of $8,000.  If we can make a deal work around that number, I'm ready to buy today. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,4,
