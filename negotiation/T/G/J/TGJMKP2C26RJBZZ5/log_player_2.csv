It's always worth trying to negotiate further.  $950,000 is a good price, but you can potentially save more by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down further."

Alice's offer is still high, but she's shown a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue trying for a lower price."

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying, while still pushing for a price closer to my target."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

While I'd love to continue negotiating, Alice is coming down very slowly.  At this price, I'm saving a significant amount compared to buying from John, and the risk of continuing to negotiate might mean losing the product entirely.  It's time to accept and secure the deal."
