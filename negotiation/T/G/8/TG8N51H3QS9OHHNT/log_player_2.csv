"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500. This is a special offer considering the high quality and the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're offering, but unfortunately, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. I'd be happy to make a counteroffer of $8,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product would be a great asset to me."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $8,750 for the product. This still allows you to acquire a valuable asset while staying within your financial limits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is closer to Bob's target of $8,000 and within his budget.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to another seller increases with each round. Accepting the offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at a reasonable price."
