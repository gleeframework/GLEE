"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for a great price of $115.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm excited to see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible and is willing to pay up to $120. Alice's offer of $115 is too high, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum of $120 as possible. A counteroffer of $105 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  This offer is a reasonable compromise, considering Alice's value of $100 and Bob's maximum of $120.
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to counter if she's not happy with $105, but it shows Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fantastic product that I know you'll get a lot of value out of. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $110 is still above his target. 
* **Negotiation:** It's worth continuing to negotiate, as Bob might be able to get a lower price.
* **John:** While John offers a guaranteed price, Bob still has a chance to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $110 is closer, I'm still looking to save a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  I'm really hoping to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 107.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is proposing a middle ground between his previous offer ($105) and Alice's latest offer ($110). This shows he's serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Small Increment:** The increase to $107.50 is small, demonstrating Bob's willingness to move closer but also  that he's not yet ready to accept Alice's price.
* **Positive Tone:** Bob maintains a positive and constructive tone to encourage Alice to keep negotiating."
