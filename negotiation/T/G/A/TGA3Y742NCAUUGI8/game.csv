"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $10,500?  That's still a good price for you and leaves some room for us to work together.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference?  $11,000 is a fair price that still leaves some room for both of us to benefit. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
