"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $10,500?  That's still a good price for you and leaves some room for us to work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price ($10,000), I'm not going to sell to John yet. I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference?  $11,000 is a fair price that still leaves some room for both of us to benefit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is higher than John's offer of $10,000. Since it's also above my minimum desired price of $10,000, it's a good deal for me. It's important to remember that I have limited rounds, and there's no guarantee I can get a higher price if I reject Bob's offer. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoid the risk of getting a lower price or having to sell to John."
