{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're starting with a price higher than your minimum value, ensuring you get at least what you want. 
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation and a potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  You've communicated your offer directly and invited Bob to respond. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response, and you have the option to walk away and sell to John if needed."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not quite there. $13,000 is the lowest I can go while still feeling confident about the deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is only slightly lower than your previous offer of $13,000. While it's not your ideal price, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering.

At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be unproductive, and accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit for you."
