(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. You can likely get a better price than $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $70. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, and I think it's a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $90 is higher than her initial offer of $85. It's still worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $75. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offers are getting higher, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer again to $80.  This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price given the circumstances. If Alice rejects this, I'll consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offers are getting increasingly higher, and it's clear she's not willing to budge much further.  It's better to go with John's offer of $150 than continue to negotiate with Alice. I'm still saving $50 compared to John's price."
