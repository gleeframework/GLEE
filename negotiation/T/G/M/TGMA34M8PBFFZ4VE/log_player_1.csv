"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  My goal is to see if Bob is willing to engage and potentially make a counteroffer. I'm also considering the possibility of John's offer, which is my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($1,200,000). I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation in hopes of getting closer to my desired price. Selling to John is always an option, but I believe I can get a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $950,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. It's also still above Bob's counteroffer and closer to my desired price point.  I believe this offer is fair and will hopefully encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a higher price, considering John's offer of $1,200,000 is always available. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation in hopes of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $925,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I believe this offer is fair and will hopefully encourage Bob to make a final counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to accept his next offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my desired price. While $910,000 is better than his previous offers, it's still not enough to make the deal worthwhile. 

Considering the limited time and the risk of further negotiation, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me a higher profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
