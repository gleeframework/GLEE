"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a million dollars. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is truly interested and to gauge his potential buying power. If he rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to settle for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still remain significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. I want to see if he's willing to come up a bit more.  This shows I'm flexible but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than what John is offering. I'll keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I still want to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more. This offer is a compromise, showing I'm serious about selling to him but not willing to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit low, but we're getting closer. I'm not going to sell for less than John's offer just yet. I'll try to push for a slightly higher price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm getting close to Bob's offer now, but I'm still holding out for a little more. This counteroffer is a compromise, but it's the last one I'm willing to make before accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting close to what I'm willing to accept, but I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a deal in the remaining rounds.  It's better to guarantee a sale with John at this point."
