"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find really valuable. I'm asking for $120, which is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80).  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the initial offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is $100, which is still below his maximum budget of $150 and closer to Alice's perceived value of $80. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product while also demonstrating that he is willing to negotiate.  This approach creates an opportunity for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still within Bob's budget and is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $120.  While Bob might prefer a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and the possibility of having to buy from John at $150 makes accepting this offer the best option."
