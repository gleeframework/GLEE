"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and still gives me a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500.
