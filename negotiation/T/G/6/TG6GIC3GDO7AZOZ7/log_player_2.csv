# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. Buying from John gets you the product at the best possible price."
