Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, I'm starting with a price closer to my own valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth without directly revealing my minimum price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and the question ""What are your thoughts?"" signal my willingness to negotiate and hear Bob's perspective. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to find a price that Bob perceives as a ""good deal"" while still being significantly higher than his $800,000 valuation.  If Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm prepared to negotiate down slightly. However, I'm secure knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John at my desired minimum."
