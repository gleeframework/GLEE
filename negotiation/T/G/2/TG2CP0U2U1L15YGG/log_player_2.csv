"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and thought of you since it might be right up your alley. I'm offering it to you at $22,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way too high! You'd be massively overpaying. John is offering you a much better deal at $8,000, which is the maximum you're willing to spend."
