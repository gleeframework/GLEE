"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. While buying from John is always an option, it's worth exploring if you can get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save as much as possible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get the price down further. You can potentially still get a better deal by counter-offering. While buying from John is an option, it's still better to see if you can get a lower price from Alice first."

This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while getting me a good price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering you a final counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly firm on her price.  While a further counteroffer could potentially get it down a bit more, it's risky.  If she rejects, you're forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to lock in this price and secure the product. This deal still saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John."
