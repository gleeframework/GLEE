Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name].  I believe it could bring immense value to you, especially considering its potential. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming high initially allows you to potentially secure a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product ($1,200,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a solid backup offer from John ($800,000), ensuring you won't be forced to accept a lowball offer from Bob. 

By starting with a strong offer and leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of getting the best possible price from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
