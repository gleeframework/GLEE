"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal.  He should try to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get the price down closer to his $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, considering your interest.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. $11,500 is still a good deal for him considering his limit of $10,000, and it's better than buying from John for $10,000. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer and he might end up having to buy from John anyway."
