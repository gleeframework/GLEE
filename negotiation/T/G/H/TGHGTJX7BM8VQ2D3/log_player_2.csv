Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $11,250.

``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $11,000. Accepting at $11,250 secures a decent price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through entirely."
