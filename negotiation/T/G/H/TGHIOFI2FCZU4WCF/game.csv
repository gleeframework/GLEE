"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  This is still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $109? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",109.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're on a tight budget, but $109 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $111.  It's a small step up from your offer, and a good compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",111.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to shave off a few more dollars. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I'm really interested in the product and I think we're getting close to a deal.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $108 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $109.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to finalizing this deal. What do you say?",109.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget, and I think we're getting close to a deal. Would you be willing to meet me at $109? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers.",109.0,Bob,8,
