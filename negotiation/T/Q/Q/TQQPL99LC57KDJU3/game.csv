"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I appreciate the value, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. This product is truly top-of-the-line and will bring you a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However,  $9,500 is still less than I'm willing to accept.  Let's make this easy - would you do $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
