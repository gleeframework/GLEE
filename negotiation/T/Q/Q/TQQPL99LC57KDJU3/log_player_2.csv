Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I appreciate the value, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it."",

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. This product is truly top-of-the-line and will bring you a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However,  $9,500 is still less than I'm willing to accept.  Let's make this easy - would you do $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to her lowest acceptable price ($12,000).  Since you can buy the product from John for $10,000, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice. You'll save $2,000 by going with John."
