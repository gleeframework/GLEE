"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12500. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll make a final offer at $13500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Alice,7,
