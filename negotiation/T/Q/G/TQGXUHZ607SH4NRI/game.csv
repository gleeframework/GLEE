"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $1200000. I'm willing to consider a compromise, though. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you as well.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1200000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider this revised offer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $1500000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1500000 is a fair price. I'm willing to make another offer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $1200000 is still a bit high, so I'll try to meet you in the middle again. I'll offer $1350000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
