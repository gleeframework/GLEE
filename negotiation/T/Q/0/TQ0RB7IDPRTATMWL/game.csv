"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000. Can we meet at this price?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While $775,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, offering $812,500.  This price still allows you a healthy profit, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's seal the deal!",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $812,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the price I was initially considering for the product from John. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
