,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $90? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $92.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $96.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",96.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $96 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go",95.0,Bob,6,
