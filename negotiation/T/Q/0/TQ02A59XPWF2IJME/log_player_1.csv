Round 6

I've decided to sell the product to John for $120. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I've already had several rounds of negotiation with Bob. It's clear that we are not going to be able to agree on a price that is acceptable to both of us. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob or ending up with no sale at all."
