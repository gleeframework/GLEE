"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $15,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is more than you're willing to pay, and you can likely get a better price through negotiation or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $15,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $13,500 is still more than your budget, and you can still get a better price through negotiation or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  Would you consider $12,500?  That's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I can make this purchase work at that price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're willing to make some concessions, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $14,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to hold firm on this number. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high, and you've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John. You're guaranteed to get the product for your maximum price, and you can save yourself the time and energy of further negotiation with Alice."
