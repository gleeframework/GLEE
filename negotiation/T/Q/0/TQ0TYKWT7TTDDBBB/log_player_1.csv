Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $15,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $15,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  Would you consider $12,500?  That's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I can make this purchase work at that price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I can see you're willing to make some concessions, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $14,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to hold firm on this number."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
