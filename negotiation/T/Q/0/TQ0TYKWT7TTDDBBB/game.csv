"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $15,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's value.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $15,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  Would you consider $12,500?  That's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I can make this purchase work at that price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're willing to make some concessions, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $14,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to hold firm on this number.",14000.0,Alice,5,
