"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $130. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth at least $150 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $130 is less than your maximum price, there's a good chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one. You can always fall back on buying from John for $150."
