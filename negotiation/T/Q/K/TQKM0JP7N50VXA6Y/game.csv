"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering its value to me.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,300,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product is even higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects both of our positions and feels like a fair deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
