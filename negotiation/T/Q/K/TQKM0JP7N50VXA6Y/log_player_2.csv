"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It is in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,300,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product is even higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects both of our positions and feels like a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget of $1,500,000 and is a good compromise.  Accepting the offer will save Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will only lead to more rounds and not a significantly lower price."
