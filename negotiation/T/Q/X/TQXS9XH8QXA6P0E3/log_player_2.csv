{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counterproposal. Considering your valuation of the product and to facilitate our transaction, I am willing to offer the product at $11,000. This price reflects a compromise while still allowing us both to benefit from the deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your patience and understanding. I'm glad we're making progress. In light of your offer, I would like to suggest a price of $10,750 for the product. This price is reflective of its value and also allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Bob's Target:** $10,750 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $10,500.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or become less willing to negotiate.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If Bob rejects the offer, there's a chance Alice might become firm on her price or even increase it.  There's also the risk of running out of negotiation rounds.

**Overall:** While Bob might be able to squeeze out a bit more, accepting the offer at $10,750 is a good deal considering his goal is to save money. It's better than the $15,000 from John and within Bob's budget."
