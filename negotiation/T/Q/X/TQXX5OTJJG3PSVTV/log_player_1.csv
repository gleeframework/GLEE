{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point that is above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **The message:**  A friendly tone and highlighting the product's value  encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Starting High:** It allows for potential negotiation down to a price that is still profitable for you.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** It keeps the negotiation open without immediately making you appear inflexible. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly approach makes Bob more likely to engage. 

**Remember:** You can adjust the price higher or lower depending on your assessment of the product's potential value to Bob and your desire to quickly close the deal. You can also modify the message to include more details about the product to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still worth exploring if you can get a better price. 

* **Reason for rejecting:**  You can likely get closer to your desired price with some further negotiation.
* **Next step:** You'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to your initial $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a little lower than I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** The message remains friendly, acknowledging Bob's offer while suggesting a middle ground. It also uses the word ""split"" to emphasize that you're being flexible and looking for a mutually agreeable solution.

**Why this strategy is effective:**

* **Shows flexibility:** This shows Bob you are willing to negotiate and makes you seem reasonable.
* **Staying above your minimum:**  $16,000 is still above your minimum value of $12,000, so you're still getting a good deal.
* **Encourages further discussion:** It keeps the negotiation open, giving you a chance to potentially reach a price closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15000?  This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $15,000 is a good price, considering your minimum value of $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away completely, leaving you with John's offer of $12,000. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and it's not guaranteed to yield a significantly better outcome.

**Accepting the offer:**  It's the most reasonable choice at this point, securing a good price and avoiding potential complications."
