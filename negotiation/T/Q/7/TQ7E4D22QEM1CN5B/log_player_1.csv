Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering the value it offers, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but significantly lower than your minimum ($1,200,000).** This creates room for negotiation while leaving a healthy margin for you.
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value for Bob.** This builds rapport and encourages him to consider the offer seriously.

I'll be ready to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far too low.  It's below his own perceived value of $800,000, indicating he's trying to take advantage.  

I need to maintain a strong negotiating position.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still allows for a healthy profit for you, while ensuring I receive a fair price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Rejects Bob's low offer while remaining polite.**  This keeps the negotiation open and shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Offers a price closer to my minimum ($1,200,000).** This demonstrates my firm position and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasizes the product's value and potential benefits for Bob.**  This reinforces the rationale behind my price and encourages him to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  It seems Bob is pushing for a lower price, and I want to see if he's willing to go higher.  Rejecting his offer will give me a chance to send a counter-offer that's more advantageous for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal, and $750,000 is closer to what we're looking for. However, considering the value and potential of this product, I'm only able to go down to $850,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a great opportunity for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Acknowledges Bob's offer but maintains my stance.** This keeps the negotiation friendly and shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Offers a price slightly above Bob's offer, but still significantly lower than my minimum.**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for a price too far below my desired range.
* **Reiterates the value and potential of the product.** This emphasizes the reason for my higher price and encourages Bob to reconsider his position."
