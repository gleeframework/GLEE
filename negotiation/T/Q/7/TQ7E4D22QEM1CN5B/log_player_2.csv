Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still allows for a healthy profit for you, while ensuring I receive a fair price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal, and $750,000 is closer to what we're looking for. However, considering the value and potential of this product, I'm only able to go down to $850,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a great opportunity for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
