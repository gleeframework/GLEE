"Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at no less than $800000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000.  I'm confident this is a price that reflects its potential and would be a valuable addition to your portfolio. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
