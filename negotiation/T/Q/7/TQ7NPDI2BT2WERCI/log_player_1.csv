{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. I'm confident Bob will be motivated to buy since the value to him is higher than my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $13,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  I believe I can push Bob closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
