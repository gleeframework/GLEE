"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly less than what Bob is willing to pay from John.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price. Bob should attempt to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider a price of $850000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also showing my willingness to negotiate. What do you think?

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is comfortable paying. While it is a better price than her initial offer, it's worth attempting to negotiate further. Bob still has room to lower the price before buying from John."
