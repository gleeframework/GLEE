"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While it's tempting to accept, he can get the product for a lower price from John. There's no reason to pay more than his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm really looking to get this product for closer to my budget.  How about we settle on $8,500?  That's still a great price for you and saves me a bit."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to get a good profit on this product. Considering its value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's counteroffer is still too high, and it's clear she's not willing to budge much.  John is offering the product for Bob's maximum price, so there's no reason to risk further negotiation with Alice."
