Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
