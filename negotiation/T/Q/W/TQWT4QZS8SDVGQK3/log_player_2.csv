{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $130 is higher than your maximum budget of $100. 
* You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which is $100. 
* This is a fair price considering the product is only worth $120 to Alice. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, I can always buy the product from John for the same price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $125 is still higher than my maximum budget of $100.
* I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get a better price.
* There's a chance Alice might come down further, and I can always purchase from John for $100 if this fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from $100 to $110. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to negotiate a lower price.
* This price is still within my budget and is a reasonable compromise, considering the product is worth $120 to Alice.
* If Alice rejects this offer, I can still buy the product from John for $100."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $100. 
* I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get a better price. 
* It's possible Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she's already rejected my previous counteroffer. 
* I can always buy from John for $100 if this round fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer again, to $115. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to negotiate a lower price.
* This price is a compromise, considering the product is worth $120 to Alice and my maximum budget is $100.
* If Alice rejects this offer, I can still buy the product from John for $100. However, I believe this price is close enough to her valuation that she might be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $119 is still above my maximum budget of $100.
* We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down much further. 
* There's a high chance that we'll continue to negotiate without reaching an agreement within my budget. 
* To avoid further negotiation and potential delays, I'm going to buy the product from John for $100. This guarantees I get the product at the price I'm comfortable with and ensures I don't waste more time on a potentially fruitless negotiation."
