"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Bob,4,
