"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $110?  ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference and settle at $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
