Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I'll always be able to sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $12,000. While it's tempting to accept, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping he'll see the value in my product and accept this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is too low, even though he is getting closer to my minimum value.  It's better to sell to John for $15,000 and secure the best possible price.  This ensures I meet my minimum value and avoid further negotiation."
