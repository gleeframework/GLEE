Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $80.,90.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $77.50? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $80.",77.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $77.50 is closer, I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. How about $70?",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $75? It's still a good price considering the product's value to you is $80.",75.0,Alice,5,
