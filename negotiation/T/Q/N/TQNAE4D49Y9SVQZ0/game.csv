"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $15,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $17,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $16,000? That's a good compromise and lets us both walk away happy.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $16,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you.",16500.0,Alice,5,
