"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  You'd pay $12,000 from Alice, which is less than the $15,000 you'd pay from John.
* **The product is still worth more to you:** Even at $12,000, the product is worth more to you than it is to Alice. You're still getting a good deal."
