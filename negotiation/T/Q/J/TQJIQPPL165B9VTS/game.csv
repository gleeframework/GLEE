"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price at $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering my budget and the market value. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be upfront â€“ while I value our discussions, $950,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $975,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your decision.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is a compromise on your end, but I'm still not comfortable going above $950,000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $955,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. If this is still not acceptable, I may need to consider purchasing from John for $800,000.",955000.0,Bob,6,
