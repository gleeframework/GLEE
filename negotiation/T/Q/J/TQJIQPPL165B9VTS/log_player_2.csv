Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be upfront â€“ while I value our discussions, $950,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $975,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your decision.
