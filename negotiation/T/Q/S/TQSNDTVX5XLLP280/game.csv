"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering me the product, but $20,000 is far above what I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to consider a price closer to $12,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while also leaving room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 undervalues the product significantly. It's packed with features and benefits that justify a higher price. Could you consider something closer to $17,000? It's a fair offer that reflects the product's true value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.",12000.0,Bob,4,
