# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his budget and there's no reason to accept it right away. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation and he can try to push for a lower price."
