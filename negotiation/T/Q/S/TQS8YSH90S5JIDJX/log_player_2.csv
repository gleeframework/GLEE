"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. $9,000 is over your budget, and you can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
``` 

Starting with a lower counteroffer than your maximum budget is a good strategy. This shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal, and gives you room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but you can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800} 
```

This counteroffer shows you are willing to compromise but still want a good deal. It also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice is now very close to your budget, but you still have a few rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting this offer keeps the possibility of a better deal open, especially since John is offering the product for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7900} 
``` 

You're getting closer to your goal. This offer is still below Alice's last offer, but it's closer to what you're willing to pay. You're showing you're willing to compromise, but also that you're not desperate to buy from her. This strategy might push Alice to accept your offer or come down further in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is the best offer you've gotten from Alice. It matches John's price, and you're in the later rounds. It's unlikely you'll get a better price, so accepting it is the most logical decision."
