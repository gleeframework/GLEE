"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize the potential value of this product, I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm also prepared to explore other options if this isn't acceptable.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your initial offer is lower than I'd hoped, I understand you see the potential value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,700,000?  This accounts for the product's true worth and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,700,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
