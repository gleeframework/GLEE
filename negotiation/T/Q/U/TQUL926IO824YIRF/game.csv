"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90 just yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $130. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it!",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not going to go any lower than $125. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go as high as $115. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll make a serious commitment to purchasing the product.",115.0,Bob,6,
