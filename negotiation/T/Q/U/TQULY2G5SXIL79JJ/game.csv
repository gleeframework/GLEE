"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a valuable asset that could be a game-changer for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not in the range I need to make this deal work.  To keep moving forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to benefit.  Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  I hope we can finalize this agreement soon.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  $1,000,000 is still too low for me. To close this deal, I need to be at $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that this will be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be as fair as possible. I can't go any higher than $975,000.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",975000.0,Bob,8,
