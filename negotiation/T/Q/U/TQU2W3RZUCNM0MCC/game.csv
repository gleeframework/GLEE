"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is simply too low for this product. It's high quality and very sought after.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While I agree the product is great, $9,000 is still a bit above what I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, $9,000 is a significant investment.  Let's try to find a sweet spot. How about $8,250? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects the value of this product.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $7,625?",7625.0,Bob,6,
