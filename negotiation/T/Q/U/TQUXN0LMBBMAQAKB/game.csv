"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $6,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value I know you'll get from it.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. However,  $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,875.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.",7875.0,Alice,5,
