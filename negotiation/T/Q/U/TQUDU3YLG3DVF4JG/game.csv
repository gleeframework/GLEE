,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about $115?  It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit high for me. Can you consider $112? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $112 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'll go down to $113.  This is my final offer.",113.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $113 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $111, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",111.0,Bob,6,
