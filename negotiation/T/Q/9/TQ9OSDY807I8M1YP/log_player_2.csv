"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $22,000 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's well over my budget of $12,000.  I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my budget but still leaves some room for negotiation. $14,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and I believe it's a fair starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $19,000? This reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, $19,000 is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly above my maximum. I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $19,000 is still a bit steep. How about $16,000? This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my goal of staying under $17,000.  I'm offering $16,000, which is a significant discount from her previous offer and a good compromise.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to overpay."
