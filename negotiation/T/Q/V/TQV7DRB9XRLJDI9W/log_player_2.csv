"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product, valued at $15,000 to you. I'm willing to let you have it for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a steal considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:**  While you could get the product from John for $15,000, Alice is offering it for $12,000, which is a significant savings.
* **Your goal is to save money:**  Your objective is to minimize your spending. 
* **You don't know what John's actual worth is:** You only know what John is willing to sell for, not the true value to him. This means the deal with Alice is potentially the best available."
