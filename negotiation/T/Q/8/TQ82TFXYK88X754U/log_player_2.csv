(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $950,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should aim to get the price closer to $900,000 before considering buying from John."
