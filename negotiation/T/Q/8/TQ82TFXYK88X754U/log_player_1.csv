``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also highlights the potential value to Bob, which might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me and the potential for negotiation, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. There's room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Considering its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $925,000?  This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is close to my desired price point and significantly higher than selling to John.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Bob walking away entirely or further lowering his offer is too high. Accepting this offer ensures a good sale and avoids potential loss."
