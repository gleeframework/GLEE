"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's always better to try to negotiate, especially since you have 10 rounds to try.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This establishes a clear negotiation stance and sets the stage for potential compromise. Since I have multiple rounds, I'm aiming to see if Alice is willing to come down significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue pushing for a price closer to my goal, which is to acquire the product for as close to $1,000,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but still firmly within my budget.  By moving closer to her last offer, I'm hoping to encourage her to consider a compromise.  I have multiple rounds left, so I'm not rushing into accepting a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my goal, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  I'm confident that with more rounds, we can reach a price that benefits both of us. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my $1,000,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to Alice and my budget constraints.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to purchase from John at the same price, ensuring I get the product.  This strategy minimizes my risk while still allowing me to potentially save money."
