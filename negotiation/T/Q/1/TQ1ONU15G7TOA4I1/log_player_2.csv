"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.
* It's better to reject and negotiate a lower price. 
* Buying from John at $12,000 is a good fallback option, but it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.
* Offering $11,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* This counteroffer sets a clear expectation and encourages Alice to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $11,000. I'm willing to drop my price to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target of $12,000. 
* There's still room for negotiation to get closer to Bob's target.
* Buying from John at $12,000 remains a viable option, but it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $12,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is pushing for a price closer to his target of $12,000.
* Offering $12,500 shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* This counteroffer emphasizes a fair price for both parties, increasing the chances of Alice accepting."
