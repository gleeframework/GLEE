"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $11,000. I'm willing to drop my price to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $12,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
