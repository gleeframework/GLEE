Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $12,000 by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $11,000. I'm willing to drop my price to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $12,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $12,500 is a good price, and it's more than I would get from John.  I'm happy to close the deal."
