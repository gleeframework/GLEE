"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a great product for a lower price, and I get a quick sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I accept her offer, I'll be paying $9,500, which is more than I'm willing to pay. I can get the same product from John for $8,000, so I'll reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
