Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your prompt response. We understand your position and are committed to finding a mutually beneficial solution. Our latest counteroffer for the product is $975,000. We hope this aligns better with your expectations and brings us closer to closing this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $975,000 is still slightly above John's price, it's a significant saving compared to her previous offers and a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate for a smaller difference carries the risk of Alice raising her price or the negotiation reaching an impasse, leading to you paying the full $1,000,000 to John anyway."
