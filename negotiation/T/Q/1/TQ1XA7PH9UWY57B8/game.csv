,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a good value.",85.0,Alice,5,
