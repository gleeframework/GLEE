"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's value, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and positive, hoping to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $60 is significantly less than my minimum price. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$75 is still below my minimum price of $150. I'm willing to continue negotiating but I'm not going to drop below my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a good value."", ""product_price"": 85}
