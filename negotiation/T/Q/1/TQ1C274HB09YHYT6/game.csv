"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be possible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to consider it. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
