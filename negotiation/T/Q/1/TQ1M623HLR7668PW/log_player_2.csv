"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you and I've priced it at $15,000 to reflect that value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far above his budget, and he has a better option with John.  He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. He should counteroffer again, trying to get closer to his maximum of $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,000 is still pretty far off from what I need, but I'm willing to accept $10,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's final offer of $10,500 is still above his ideal price point. While he could try to negotiate further, it's risky. He has a guaranteed deal with John for $8,000, which is well within his budget and the safest option."
