,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only do $8,500 right now. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $9,000. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to buy. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,000 is still pretty far off from what I need, but I'm willing to accept $10,500. This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
