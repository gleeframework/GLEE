"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate a better price. However, I must consider the product's value and the time and effort I've invested in it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
