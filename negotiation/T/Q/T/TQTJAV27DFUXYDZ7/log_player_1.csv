"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but one that's still lower than my minimum value. This is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I want to leave some room for him to counteroffer without making me feel like I need to go to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's closer to my minimum value. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise but still want to earn as much as possible. This is a good middle ground that hopefully encourages Bob to accept without risking him walking away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating but I'm nearing the point where selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer a bit more, but still staying above my minimum value. This shows Bob I'm serious about closing the deal, but also that I'm not desperate. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway, and if he doesn't, I'm prepared to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum value, and we are approaching the halfway point of the negotiation.  The risk of continuing and ending up with a lower price is not worth it. It's time to move on to John and secure the guaranteed $12,000."
