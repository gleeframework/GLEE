Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to try to negotiate with her or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it reflects your commitment to buying the product while still staying within your budget.  You're hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You're confident you can negotiate a lower price, especially since you have the option of buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice you're serious about buying but still pushing for a lower price. It's a good middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  You're hoping this will encourage Alice to meet you halfway."
