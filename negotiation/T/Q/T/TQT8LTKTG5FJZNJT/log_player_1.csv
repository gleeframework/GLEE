Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and still being attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **You are getting significantly more than your minimum:** You're aiming for a $4000 profit, which is a good deal.
* **Bob is still getting a good deal:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so a $12,000 price means he's saving $3,000. 
* **You're mitigating risk:** If Bob rejects, you still have John lined up for a guaranteed $8,000 sale.

This strategy maximizes your chances of getting the highest possible price while also minimizing the risk of losing out completely."
