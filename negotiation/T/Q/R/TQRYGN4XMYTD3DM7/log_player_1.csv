Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000,  Alice knows it's worth at least $15,000 to her and has a guaranteed buyer at that price.  Therefore, she starts with a strong offer above both of these figures.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $20,000 offer allows space for potential counter-offers from Bob. If Bob is completely uninterested, Alice can always decrease the price slightly. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice's guaranteed sale to John at $15,000 gives her leverage. She doesn't need to undervalue the product out of desperation.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest."
