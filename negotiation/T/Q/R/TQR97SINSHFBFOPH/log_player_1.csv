Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $100."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to sell it for less than our own valuation ($80). We aim to get a price higher than $80 if possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a higher price ($100) allows room for potential negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, bringing the price closer to his valuation while still giving us a profit.
* **Backup Option:** We have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $80 if Bob declines. This reduces our risk of not selling the product at all."
