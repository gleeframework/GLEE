Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is more than your $100 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a $5 buffer between your offer and Bob's potential value. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** You don't want to scare Bob off right away.

This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest while maximizing your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still worth exploring if you can get a bit closer to your desired price.  You can likely squeeze out a few more dollars by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about $108? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $108 is slightly less than what you initially aimed for, it's still a good deal. It's more than you'd get from John, and it's only $2 less than your last counteroffer.  At this point, continuing the negotiation could risk losing the sale altogether. It's best to accept and secure the profit."
