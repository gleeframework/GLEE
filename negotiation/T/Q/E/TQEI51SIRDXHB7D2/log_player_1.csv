Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This represents a significant discount compared to what I would accept from other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so we need to offer a price lower than his valuation but as close as possible to our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While we start with $1,150,000, there's a slight chance Bob might negotiate a bit higher.  
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:**  We have a safety net with John willing to pay $1,200,000. This knowledge empowers us to be firm with Bob.

**The Goal:**  The message aims to convince Bob that the offer is a great deal without revealing our absolute bottom line."
