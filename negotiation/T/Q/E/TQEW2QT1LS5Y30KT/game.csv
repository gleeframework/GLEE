"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
