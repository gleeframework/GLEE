"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $750,000. I've already given you a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go further. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'll offer it to you for $825,000.

It seems we've reached a point of diminishing returns in this negotiation.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $825,000. While I could try another counteroffer, I risk her accepting my $750,000 and losing out on a slightly better deal. At this point, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of her walking away or the continued time investment."
