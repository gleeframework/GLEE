"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but $80 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $110. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! However, $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, so I'll offer you $100. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can make a deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
