You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price, as you could potentially save a significant amount of money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will hopefully signal to Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to pay her full asking price. This creates room for negotiation and hopefully leads to a price we can both agree on."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to take a small risk and see if I can negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
