"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 was a bit steep, but I'm not comfortable with $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I see you're getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not ready to let it go for $8,000. I can do $9,500, and I think it's a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
