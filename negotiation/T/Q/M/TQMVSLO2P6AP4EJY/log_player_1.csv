Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this price?

I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  How about $950,000?  This reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle yet.  I'll try to get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I respect that.  But $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider right now. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still want to try for a higher price.  I have a few rounds left, so I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

It's getting late in the game, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.  Given that I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John, I'm going to take the $800,000 from John.  It's not ideal, but it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
