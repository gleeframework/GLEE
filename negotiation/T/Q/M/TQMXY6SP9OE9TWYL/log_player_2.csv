"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is too high. You can definitely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price before resorting to buying from John."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. It's worth exploring another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target price. I'm confident I can still get a better deal than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand the product is valuable to you, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This offer reflects the product's value to me while also being within my price range.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $950,000 is still under what I hoped for, I'm ready to move to close this deal. How about we settle at $990,000? That's a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is within my budget and represents a significant compromise on her part. It's a good deal for me, considering I can get the product for less than what John is offering.  It's time to close this deal."
