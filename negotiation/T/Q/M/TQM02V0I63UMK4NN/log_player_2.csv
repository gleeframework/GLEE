"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's also more than what the product is worth to Alice ($1,200,000).  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay and also the price I can get from John.  This counteroffer leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a strong starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm still willing to try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since she rejected my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want to get a good deal. I'm assuming Alice might be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still above my maximum budget.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, there's a risk that we'll go back and forth for a while and I'll end up paying more than I'm comfortable with. It's better to cut my losses and go with John's offer, which is within my budget and guarantees a purchase."
