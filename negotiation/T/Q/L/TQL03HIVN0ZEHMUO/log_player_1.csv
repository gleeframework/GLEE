"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's a high price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see Bob's reaction and gauge his interest. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer. 

I'm confident that I can push for a higher price since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and a backup offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, I need to recoup a bit more to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,350,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential it holds for you.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to recoup a bit more, but $1350000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000. How about $1275000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I have more rounds to negotiate and a backup offer from John, so I can afford to be a bit more assertive. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to secure a price closer to $1,350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm open to meeting you halfway, but $1,275,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,312,500. This price allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1312500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about $1275000, and I'll throw in an additional $10000 as a token of good faith? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob is offering an additional $10,000, his price is still below my target.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to try to push for a higher price one more time.  I've rejected four offers so far, and I still have five rounds left to negotiate. This is a critical moment, and I'm going to try to secure a price closer to $1,300,000. If this counteroffer fails, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's be realistic. We're both close to an agreement, but we need to bridge the gap. How about we settle on $1,293,750? It's a compromise that balances both our needs, and we can finally close this deal.  I'm confident you won't regret this decision."", ""product_price"": 1293750}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. I've lowered my price slightly to $1,293,750, which is a compromise.  I've pushed for a higher price in the previous rounds, but I'm aware that time is running out. I only have three rounds remaining before I have to accept John's offer, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable value.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will have to seriously consider selling the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we're close to an agreement, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000, and I'll throw in an additional $5000 as a token of good faith. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell the product to John. I'm running out of time and I've already rejected multiple offers from Bob. While I would have loved to secure a higher price, I can't risk another round of negotiations. John's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value, and I'm not comfortable going lower. This is a safe option that guarantees I'll still get a good return on my investment."
