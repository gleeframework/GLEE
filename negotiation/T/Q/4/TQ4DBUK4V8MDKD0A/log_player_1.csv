"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer that's significantly less than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" for both of us, making it more likely Bob will consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $950,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Space:**  I still have room to negotiate.  I need to find a price that's closer to my desired range while remaining attractive to Bob.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,000,000, giving him a bit more room but still ensuring I get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  How about $1,050,000?  That's still a significant discount from my original offer and leaves some room for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,050,000 is still a significant amount of money for me, and it's likely a good deal for Bob considering his estimated value of $1,500,000.
* **Positive Framing:** The message continues to be friendly and emphasizes the potential for a ""mutually beneficial deal."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it leaves room for profit for you and stays within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** There's still room for a better deal. I can likely push Bob a bit higher with a counteroffer.

**Next Step:** I'll counter with a price just below $1,000,000 to see if I can bridge the gap and secure a more favorable deal than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $995,000. It's a fair price that leaves both of us with a good profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm proposing a price that's almost exactly in the middle between my last offer and Bob's current offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Mutual Profit:** I emphasize the ""good profit margin"" for both of us, reminding Bob that this deal is beneficial to him as well.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and invites Bob to reach a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $995,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. How about $985,000?  It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize this quickly. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $985,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still not enough for me to comfortably accept. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob is showing a strong desire to finalize the deal. 

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $985,000, aiming to meet Bob in the middle and close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $990,000? That's a fair price that gives us both a good profit margin, and we can finalize this quickly.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price right in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Finality:**  I mention ""finalizing this quickly"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the ""good profit margin"" for both of us to remind Bob of the shared value in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're very close to a deal! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go up to $987,500. This is a great price for both of us, and we can finalize this quickly. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Goal:** $987,500 is significantly closer to my minimum price than John's offer of $800,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, there is a high risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and being forced to sell to John.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, there's a good chance that I could secure a price closer to $1,000,000 in the next round. However, there's also a chance that Bob will refuse my counteroffer, and I'll be left with John's offer. 

**Considering the risk of losing out on a better deal, I've decided to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.**"
