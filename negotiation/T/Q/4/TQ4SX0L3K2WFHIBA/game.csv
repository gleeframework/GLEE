"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1800000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1300000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1300000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1650000. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1650000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to go up to $1450000.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still think the product's value is higher than $1450000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1575000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1575000.0,Alice,5,
