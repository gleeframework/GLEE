Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value, but still gives you a profit significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Is polite and inviting:**  It emphasizes the value to Bob and encourages him to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Sets a clear expectation:**  The price is stated upfront to avoid confusion. 

Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to counter Bob's offers if necessary, and don't hesitate to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1200000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a deal that leaves me with so little profit.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a price that is more beneficial for me.  I can still walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This would give you a great deal, and still allow me to make a decent profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is still lower than my initial goal, it's a good compromise.  It's  above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and also a significant profit. 

I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a stalemate or a lower price for me.  There's always a risk that Bob will walk away, but at this point, I'm comfortable taking the deal and closing the sale."
