"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. I think it's a fair price, considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $90 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80. Therefore, rejecting the offer and negotiating a lower price is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to secure a deal within his budget while also demonstrating he's serious about buying the product. Offering $75 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still within the realm of a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $85?  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80. While it's a step closer, it's still not within Bob's comfort zone.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better price.  Rejecting this offer and counteroffering again is the logical next step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my absolute maximum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his budget limit of $80. This offer is a significant concession from his previous offer and shows his willingness to negotiate.  He's also reminding Alice of the potential for a quick deal, as he can simply buy from John for the same price."
