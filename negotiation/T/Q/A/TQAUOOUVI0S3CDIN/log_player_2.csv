"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement today. I am willing to offer the product to you for $14,000. This price takes into account its value and ensures a fair transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints.

This price reflects a compromise between our initial offers, allowing you to acquire the product at a reasonable cost while ensuring a fair return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress towards a mutually agreeable solution. In light of your latest proposal, I would like to suggest a price of $13,250 for the product. This price aims to balance our interests and provides a fair compensation for me, while remaining within your budget. I believe this offer will help us achieve a satisfactory outcome for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Although there are more rounds available, it seems like Alice is not willing to go much lower.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000, ensuring he stays within his budget.  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but it's also a risk that the negotiation could stall or Alice could increase her price again."
