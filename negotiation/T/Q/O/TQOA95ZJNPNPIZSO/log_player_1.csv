Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob accepts, great! If not, we can negotiate. I want to see if he's truly interested and what his budget is."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is a good price, but I'm aiming for higher. I want to see if I can push him further before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still aiming for a good profit. I want to show Bob I'm serious about selling, but I'm not giving in easily.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get more. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll see if I can push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, showing Bob I'm flexible and willing to compromise.  But I'm not going lower than this.  If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call.  While $1,050,000 is only a little more than John's offer, it's still a good profit.  I'm getting concerned that I might not get a better deal from Bob and could end up selling to John for less.  It's time to lock in a decent deal and avoid the risk."
