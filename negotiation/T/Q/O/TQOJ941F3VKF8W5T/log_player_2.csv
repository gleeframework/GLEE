"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds and the option of buying from John for $8,000 as a safety net, so you have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and would allow us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you and the original price I had in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I can continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price of $8,000.  I have 7 rounds left, and the option to buy from John for $8,000, so I'm not in a rush to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $9,500 for the product. This is a significant step towards meeting your needs, while still remaining within my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but $10,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try to get a lower price. I have 5 rounds left and the option to buy from John for $8,000, so I can afford to be a bit more patient.  I'll make another counteroffer, hoping to close the deal at a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm ready to offer you $9,750 for the product. It's a significant step closer to your last offer and represents a fair price for both of us.  I believe this is a good opportunity for us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and Alice is showing a pattern of meeting me halfway but not going below $10,000. While $10,125 is closer to my ideal price, it's still more than I'm comfortable with.  With only three rounds remaining, I don't have much leverage left. It's safer to secure the product from John for $8,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to an even higher price."
