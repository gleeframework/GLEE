"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always better to try to negotiate a better price.  Since Alice's offer is above your budget, rejecting it and making a counteroffer is the most logical move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
``` 
Let's start with a strong offer of $8000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation. Buying from John for $10,000 is the most reliable way to get the product within my budget."
