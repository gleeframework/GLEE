"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet in the middle, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $125. If you're not able to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",125.0,Bob,4,
