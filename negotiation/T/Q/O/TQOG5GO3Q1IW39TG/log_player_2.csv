"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Let's see if you can get her to budge a little more."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,250 is closer, but I'm still aiming to be a little lower.  I'm happy to pay $10,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is a good price, you are still within your budget and can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. You have 5 rounds left, so there's still time to see if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I'm not budging from there. This is my last concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is firm on $11,500, and you've reached a point where further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price. You've already saved a significant amount compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids risking losing the deal entirely."
