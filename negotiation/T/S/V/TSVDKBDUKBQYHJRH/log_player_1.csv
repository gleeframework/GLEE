"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and leaves potential for a profit greater than $200,000.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and persuasive tone in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the product's value to reinforce the price point. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response (or lack thereof) to determine my next move. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing the negotiation. I also need to weigh the risk of losing the deal to John if I'm not careful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer is above my minimum value ($1,000,000), but it's still significantly less than what I initially asked for. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's room for improvement in the negotiation. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob acknowledged the product's value. 
* **Weighing the Risk:** While selling to John guarantees a $1,000,000 profit, I see potential to earn more with Bob. However, I need to be mindful of the limited rounds and avoid getting stuck in a stalemate.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price. I'll need to find a balance between being aggressive and reasonable to avoid pushing Bob away entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, it's still higher than Bob's offer, reflecting the product's worth.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and my need for a reasonable profit to justify the price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and hopeful to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to assess whether I should continue negotiating or consider selling to John. If I continue, I'll need to decide whether to lower my price further or make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob increases. 
* **Potential Profit:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer still guarantees a $50,000 profit, which is better than selling to John and only making $0 profit. 

**Next Steps:**

Since I've accepted Bob's offer, the negotiation is concluded. I'll finalize the sale and move on to other opportunities."
