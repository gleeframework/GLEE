Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so that's the absolute maximum he'd be willing to pay. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering slightly less ($11,500) allows room for Bob to negotiate down a bit, while still securing a price significantly higher than your minimum ($8,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the safety net of John who will buy the product for $8,000, ensuring you don't lose out entirely if Bob rejects the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while giving Bob a sense of getting a (small) deal."
