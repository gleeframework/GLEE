"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. Is this something you'd be interested in?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $90 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $88.  This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $88. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the value you mentioned earlier that the product is worth to you. How about we meet at $95? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to make a deal with you.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",90.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $92.5. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",92.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go up to $91,  but this is my final offer.  I'm sure we can both find this to be a fair deal.",91.0,Bob,8,
