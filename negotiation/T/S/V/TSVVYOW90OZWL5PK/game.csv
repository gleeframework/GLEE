"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, that price point is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
