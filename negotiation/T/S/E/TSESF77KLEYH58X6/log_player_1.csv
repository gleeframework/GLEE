Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value and potential"" Alice provides a reason for the high price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase.
* **Exclusivity:**  Mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and desirability.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This offer assumes Bob is open to negotiation. If Alice knows Bob is very price-sensitive, she might start lower but still above $800,000.
* **Market Information:** If Alice has reason to believe the product is worth significantly more than $800,000 on the open market, she could aim even higher with her initial offer."
