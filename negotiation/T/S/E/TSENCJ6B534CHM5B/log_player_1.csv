It's becoming clear that Bob is very focused on a price point significantly lower than your desired outcome.  At this stage, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from Bob. Accepting his current offer is still a loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  Therefore, the best decision is to cut your losses and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $100."
