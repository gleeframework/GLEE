Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy the product for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.  I need to counter but leave myself room to negotiate.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I recognize the value, $1,350,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is getting close. I need to decide if holding out for more than $1,150,000 is worth the risk of losing the sale.
