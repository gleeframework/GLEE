"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is lower than what you're willing to pay ($120). 
* This means you can save $10 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* While you could buy from John, it's always better to get a lower price if possible."
