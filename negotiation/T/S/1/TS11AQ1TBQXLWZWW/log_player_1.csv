"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Emphasizing value:** My message highlights the product's value and the potential benefit for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message implies that there is room for negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  There are still 9 rounds remaining, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Potential to reach a compromise:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price. This can encourage Bob to make a more favorable counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price, but still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob is getting at this price, reminding him that it's still a good deal.
* **Openness to further negotiation:** The message expresses openness to further negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if he's still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $12,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $11,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate.
* **Potential for better offers:**  While there's a chance I could get a higher price in the remaining rounds, it's also possible that Bob will become less interested in the product as the negotiations drag on.

This offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of selling to John for a lower price."
