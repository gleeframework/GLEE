"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice, getting closer to her $800,000 valuation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a more competitive price."
