"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its exceptional value and quality, we are offering it to you at an introductory price of $950,000. This special offer is valid for the next 24 hours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is still higher than Bob's desired price point.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a significant savings for you and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and are willing to meet you halfway. We're now offering the product at $875,000. This price reflects a significant discount compared to the original asking price while still providing substantial value to you. We hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and there's a chance he can get the price down even further.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards Bob's target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $875,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: After careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer to $862,500. This price is reflective of the product's value and our commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. We hope this proposal is acceptable to you and moves us closer to closing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's target range and only $12,500 more than his initial counteroffer.  There's a strong chance that continuing to negotiate will result in a small price decrease, but it also risks Alice walking away or reaching a stalemate.  

Since Bob has a backup option with John for $1,000,000, accepting the offer secures a much better price while leaving room to potentially haggle with John later if needed."
