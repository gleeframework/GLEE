"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that acknowledges the significant benefits you'll gain.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This price reflects a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
