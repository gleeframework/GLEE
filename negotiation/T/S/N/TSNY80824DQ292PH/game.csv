"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying it for $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. Let's close this deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
