"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying it for $80.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I don't think there's much room for improvement with Bob.  It's better to sell to John for $120 and secure a guaranteed profit."
