"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  However, I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept Bob's offer right away. I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $12,000, hoping to meet Bob halfway. This shows I'm flexible but still value the product at more than his initial offer. I'm trying to find a sweet spot between my minimum and his maximum, and hopefully close the deal within the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm confident we can close the deal now.  Accepting his offer for $11,000 guarantees me a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
