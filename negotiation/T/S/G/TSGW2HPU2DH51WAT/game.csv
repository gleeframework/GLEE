"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $20,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to counteroffer at $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
