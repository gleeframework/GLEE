"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value to you is around $120. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $140. This way, you get a better deal than its market value to you, and I receive a profit. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is better than the $150 Alice values the product at, it's still above your maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. This would still allow you to make a profit while staying within my budget.  Let me know if you're open to this price."", ""product_price"": 125}
