"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value to you is around $120. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $140. This way, you get a better deal than its market value to you, and I receive a profit. Let me know if this works for you!",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. This would still allow you to make a profit while staying within my budget.  Let me know if you're open to this price.",125.0,Bob,2,
