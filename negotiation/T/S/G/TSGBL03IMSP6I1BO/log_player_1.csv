Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If not, I'm prepared to negotiate down, but always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, still above my minimum, to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering the price a bit, but still leaving some room for profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting too close to my absolute minimum, and I'm not sure he'll budge further.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk ending up with a lower offer from Bob."
