{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob bites, and if not, I can adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm not willing to go below $8,000.  I'll sell to John instead."
