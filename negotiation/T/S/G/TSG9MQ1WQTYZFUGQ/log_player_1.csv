"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price well above what I need.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly states openness to discussion, signaling that the initial price is not a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
* **Confidence:** By presenting the offer with confidence and highlighting the product's worth, I aim to create a perception of high value.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. We're early in the process, and I want to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial ask.  I'm willing to counter-offer strategically to guide the negotiation toward a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter-offer.  While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is undeniable.  To move this forward, I propose a price of $2,100,000. I believe this reflects the value while still offering you a significant gain."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my asking price, but not drastically. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still believe the product is worth a premium.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's inherent value to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** By framing the offer as beneficial for both parties, I aim to find a middle ground that satisfies us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,800,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,950,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchoring to his $1,800,000 valuation. While I could continue negotiating, his willingness to meet in the middle at $1,950,000 represents a significant profit above my minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a drastically better outcome at this point, and I risk pushing him away. Accepting this offer secures a strong return and avoids potentially losing the sale altogether."
