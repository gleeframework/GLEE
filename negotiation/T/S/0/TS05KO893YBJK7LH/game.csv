"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. How about we try $950000? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as 950000. How about we meet in the middle at 1025000? I think this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to sell the product for 1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 1015000? This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
