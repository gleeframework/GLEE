Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $90 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. This is my final offer: $115.  I think that's a fair price considering its value.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $100.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $100 guarantees I stay within my budget."
