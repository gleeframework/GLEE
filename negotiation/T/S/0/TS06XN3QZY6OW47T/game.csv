"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and providing your perspective. While I understand your initial offer, the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true worth of what's on the table.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still much higher than I can go.  To be honest, anything over $800,000 and I might as well go with a different seller.  How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear that you have other options, but I'm confident this product offers something unique. I'm willing to make a significant move to close this deal. How about $1,600,000?  This is a very aggressive offer, reflecting my desire to work with you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right that this product is unique and valuable. I do want to work something out with you.  I can't go as high as $1,600,000 but to show I'm serious, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but it's still a long way from reflecting the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but this is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
