Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still very far from a reasonable offer. He's increasing his bids in small increments, while we are making larger concessions.  It's time to hold firm and see if he's serious about moving closer to a price that represents the product's value.  We are still better off selling to John at this point."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but it's still a long way from reflecting the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but this is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Establish a firm stance:** It's time to signal that we're reaching our limit.  ""Final offer"" creates urgency and emphasizes that we're serious about walking away if necessary.
* **Significant, but not too drastic, decrease:** A $200,000 drop is substantial and shows we're negotiating, but it keeps us well above Bob's current offer range. 
* **Introducing the alternative (John):**  While we don't want to reveal our hand entirely,  mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob that he's not our only potential buyer."
