Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but it's still a long way from reflecting the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but this is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.

**Explanation:**

Alice has made it clear she's aiming for a much higher price than you're willing to pay. Her concessions are small and she's stated this is her final offer. It's very unlikely she'll come close to your $800,000 limit.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John, securing the product at your target price."
