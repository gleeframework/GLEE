"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price of $15,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. That's a fair price considering I can buy the same product from John for $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still too much for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500. This is a fair price considering my limit and the fact that I can buy the same product from John for $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. If you're willing to pay that, I think we can make a deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,5,
