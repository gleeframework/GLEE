"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, while still achieving a profit.  It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he has some wiggle room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000, which is what I could get from John.  I'll reject his offer and see if he'll come up with a better one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price.  It's also a significant increase from his previous offer, which might encourage him to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm not confident he'll come up to a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000."
