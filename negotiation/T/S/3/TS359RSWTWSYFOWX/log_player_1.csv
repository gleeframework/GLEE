I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's less than half of my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I believe this price is a fair compromise and might convince Bob to come closer to my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  I'm hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again to $1,100,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not confident that I can get him to go any higher, and I'm not willing to risk losing even more money.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a secure and guaranteed sale."
