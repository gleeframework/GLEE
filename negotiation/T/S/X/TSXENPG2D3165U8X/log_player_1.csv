Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows for potential for a middle ground to be reached without immediately resorting to selling to John.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum of $12,000, ensuring I don't lose out on profit. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly message helps to establish a good rapport with Bob, potentially making him more open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  
* **Exploring the counteroffer option:**  By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which I think is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** My counteroffer of $9,500 is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his range. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning for the price:**  I've included a brief justification for the price, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Keeping the door open:** The message maintains a positive and encouraging tone, allowing for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  Even though I'm accepting his offer, I can still explore selling to John if I can get a better price in the future. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale, rather than risking a further counteroffer that might be even lower."
