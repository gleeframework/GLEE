"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately it's a bit lower than I'm able to accept right now.  I'm willing to come down a little further, and I'd be happy to sell you the product for $1,100,000. This would still give you a healthy profit margin, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
