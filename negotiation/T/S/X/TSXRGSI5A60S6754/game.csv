"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000 to $900000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $850000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $975000 for the product. Can we discuss this further?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must adhere to my budgetary limits. I am unable to agree to the proposed price of $975000. I am willing to pay no more than $925000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",925000.0,Bob,6,
