Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow us both to walk away happy.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000.
