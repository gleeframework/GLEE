"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for a lower price by counteroffering Alice. While buying from John is always an option, you can save $100,000 by negotiating with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It signals your intention to buy the product but also demonstrates your desire for a lower price. This counteroffer should encourage Alice to consider your offer and potentially counter with a price closer to your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is now within your budget and closer to your desired price.  It's better than buying from John for $1,200,000, and there's no guarantee you can negotiate further and get a lower price.  It's likely Alice won't go lower, and you'll end up buying from John anyway.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $150,000."
