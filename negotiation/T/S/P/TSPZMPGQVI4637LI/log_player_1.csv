Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $120, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential worth."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target a price above your minimum:** You know you have a guaranteed $80 from John, so aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting at $120 allows Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum. 
* **Highlight value to Bob:** Emphasize that the product is worth more to him ($150) than your asking price.

This strategy attempts to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
