"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1225000.

"I understand that you're still trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1175000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,7,
