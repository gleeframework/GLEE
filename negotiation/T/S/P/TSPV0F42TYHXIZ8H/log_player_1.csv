Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we agree on $750,000?  I think that's a fair price that considers the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. Moving closer to John's offer makes less sense than trying to negotiate with Bob a bit more."
