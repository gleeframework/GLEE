"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You are trying to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth a premium due to its quality and features. How about we meet halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still trying to save money. While $90 is better than Alice's first offer, you can likely get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
