Alice's offer: The product price will be $993,750.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's maximum price. There are only a few rounds left, and while Bob might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price with Alice, there's a good chance he'll end up paying close to $1 million.  It's time to cut his losses and buy from John for $1,200,000. This guarantees Bob the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which might not lead to a significantly better price."
