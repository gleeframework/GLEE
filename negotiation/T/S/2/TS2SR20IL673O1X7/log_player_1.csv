{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it really useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum:**  It allows you some room to lower the price if needed. 
* **Fair:**  It reflects the value of the product for both parties. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $120. It's important to keep in mind that I have another buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price, so I can afford to be a bit more flexible but not too much. 

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a fair price. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  It demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation but not willing to accept his initial price.
* **It's lower than my previous offer:**  It shows that I'm flexible and willing to find a middle ground.
* **It's still above my minimum:** It ensures that I'm not selling the product for less than what it's worth to me. 

Let's see if Bob accepts my counteroffer or makes another one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  It's tempting to accept since Bob seems keen, but I have a guaranteed sale to John at $120.  I'll counter Bob one more time to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make a final offer of $92. This is a great deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to your price without compromising on my own needs. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 92} 
```

This counteroffer is a final attempt to close the deal:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **It's lower than my previous offer:** It demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **It's close to my minimum:**  It ensures that I'm not selling the product for less than what it's worth to me.

Let's see if Bob accepts my final offer or chooses to walk away!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and my original offer of $85, which would be $88.50. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has shown interest and has been willing to compromise, his final offer of $88.50 is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $120.  I'm not willing to drop my price that low, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John at my desired price.

It's time to move on and sell to John."
