Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a premium price because I know you'll greatly benefit from its unique value. Would you be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for $1,200,000 or more to Bob is unlikely to result in a sale, as it exceeds his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,100,000 represents a significant profit margin for me while still being potentially palatable for Bob, considering he values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer."
