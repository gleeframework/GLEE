"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident in the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $11,200. This is my last offer before considering other options.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,200 is still too high for me. As I mentioned, $10,500 is my final offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
