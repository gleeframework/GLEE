"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $950000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  I'm offering you the product for $1050000. This price still reflects the significant value it holds for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1100000 to $1050000, but I still think that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1025000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
