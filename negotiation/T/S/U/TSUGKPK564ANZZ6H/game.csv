"Bob, I understand you're looking to save, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,125,000?  This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. However, $1,075,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to cover my costs, and gives you a great deal. Let's close this deal, I'm confident you won't regret it.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
