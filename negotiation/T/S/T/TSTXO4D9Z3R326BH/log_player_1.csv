"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer ($1,400,000) that's slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) but well above our minimum ($1,200,000).  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high starting point allows for negotiation while still aiming for a price that significantly benefits us. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob's engagement in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While his message suggests interest, we have plenty of room for negotiation and a guaranteed offer from John. We'll counter in the next round to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is considerably below its true value. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We've come down from our initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The counteroffer ($1,300,000) remains comfortably above our minimum acceptable price and positions us for a potentially strong profit.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price and encourage Bob to move closer to our range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more around $1,200,000. Would that be agreeable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches our absolute minimum price ($1,200,000) and the price John is offering. While we could try to push for more, there's a risk Bob might walk away or drag out negotiations. Accepting now secures us the best possible outcome in a timely manner."
