"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves some room for you to make a profit.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $900,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
