Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product could be beneficial, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This is my final offer, as I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is the most strategically sound option at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** $1,100,000 is still a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital available for other opportunities.  
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There's no guarantee Bob will offer more in subsequent rounds, and continuing negotiations risks losing him entirely.  John's guaranteed offer is tempting, but this offer from Bob is strong."
