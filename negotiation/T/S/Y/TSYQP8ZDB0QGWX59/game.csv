"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm happy to pay up to $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. How about we meet at $10,500? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit too high at $10,500.  I'm firm at $9,800. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.  Let's make it happen!",9800.0,Bob,6,

"I'm almost there, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can make a deal at $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,7,
