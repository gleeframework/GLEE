"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than my maximum budget. This shows a willingness to negotiate but sets a clear limit.
* **Fair Price:** I've chosen a price that's closer to my maximum budget while still acknowledging the product's value to Alice. 
* **Reasoning:** Providing a reason for my offer makes the negotiation more professional and signals that I've considered her perspective."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my initial offer reflects the unique features and potential this product offers, which I believe will be highly beneficial for you.  To move towards a mutually agreeable outcome, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,450,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit outside my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by offering a higher price than my previous counteroffer, but still well below Alice's current offer.
* **Fair Price:** I'm reiterating the idea of a fair price that considers both our interests.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect of reaching an agreement. This helps create a sense of cooperation and encourages Alice to consider my offer."
