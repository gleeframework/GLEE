I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer.  $1,200,000 is still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

While $1,275,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still not where I want to be. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
