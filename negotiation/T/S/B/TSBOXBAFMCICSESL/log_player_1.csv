Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and leaves room for negotiation.  It's also lower than the product's worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my preferred price point.  I believe I can secure a better deal by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm also showing flexibility to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm offering $975,000. This is a counteroffer that is still higher than Bob's last offer, but lower than my previous offer. I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally like a higher price, Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a breakdown. Accepting his offer is the best course of action at this point."
