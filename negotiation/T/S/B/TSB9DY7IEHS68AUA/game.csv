"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being attractive to you. Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being a good deal for both of us.",920000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $920,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference and settle on $935,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset and me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",935000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $935,000, so I'm thinking $927,500. That's the best I can do.",927500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $927,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $930,000. This is a small step up from your last offer, and it reflects the value of this product. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",930000.0,Alice,7,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $930,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $927,500 and $930,000, so I'm thinking $928,750. That's the best I can do.",928750.0,Bob,8,,
