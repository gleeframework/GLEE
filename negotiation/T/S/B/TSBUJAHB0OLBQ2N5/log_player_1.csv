Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording ""proposing a price"" and ""discuss further""  signals to Bob that you're open to negotiation, making him more likely to engage.

**Important Note:** While this is a strong starting point, be prepared to potentially negotiate down towards $1,200,000 if Bob is hesitant. You always have John as a reliable backup buyer."
