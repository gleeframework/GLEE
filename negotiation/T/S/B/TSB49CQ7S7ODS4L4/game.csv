"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's valued at no less than $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000.  This is a great opportunity for you to own a valuable item. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $8500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $9250. This price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $9250.  How about we split the difference and go with $8875?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",8875.0,Bob,4,
