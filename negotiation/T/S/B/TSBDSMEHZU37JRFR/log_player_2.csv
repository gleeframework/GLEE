"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,500. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but the price itself is non-negotiable. I can offer you a 1-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which is a $1,000 value. Would you be interested in that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

While the extra warranty and maintenance package are nice, they're not worth the extra $1,500 to you.  At this point, it's better to just buy from John for $15,000.  You're still getting a product that's worth more to you than you're paying."
