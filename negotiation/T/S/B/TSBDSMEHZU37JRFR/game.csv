"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're enthusiasm.  I'm interested, but I'm going to have to pass on $10,000. I'm hoping to get it closer to $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I can meet you in the middle at $9,000. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  This is really my limit, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,500. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $9,500, but I'm not going any lower. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you, and I do really appreciate the product. But,  $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  I truly hope you'll consider this offer, as I'm not sure I can go any higher.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,500. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but the price itself is non-negotiable. I can offer you a 1-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which is a $1,000 value. Would you be interested in that?",9500.0,Alice,7,
