Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price above your $15,000 baseline. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning you believe the price is fair and reflects the product's worth, you create a starting point for discussion. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While the offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for him to counter-offer. This opens the door for potential negotiation toward a mutually agreeable price that's still profitable for you.

**Important:**  

This strategy assumes you have some time and flexibility. If you need to sell quickly, a lower, less negotiable offer might be more suitable."
