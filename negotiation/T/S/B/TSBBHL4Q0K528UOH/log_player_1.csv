Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. Can you consider this revised price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We are still in the early stages of negotiation. While Bob is moving closer to our desired range, accepting $1,175,000 would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table.  We'll counter with a smaller concession to test his resolve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your persistence is admirable, but we need to find a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to consider $1,200,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We've reduced our concession in this round, signaling that we're reaching the limit of our flexibility.  The message is phrased to convey firmness while still leaving room for Bob to make one final offer above $1,175,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. Can you consider this revised price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we'd ideally like to get closer to $1,200,000, Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It provides a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations or Bob walking away.  Accepting now secures a good deal."
