Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth a lot more to you than the price I'm asking. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point. 

* **Reasoning:** Offering $1,200,000 is a significant discount from your minimum value ($1,500,000) but still leaves significant profit. It's high enough to potentially entice Bob, who values the product at $800,000.
* **Next Steps:** Depending on Bob's response, you can adjust your strategy. If he rejects, you can either:
    * **Lower your price a bit:** You have room to negotiate, but be careful not to drop too low too quickly.
    * **Keep your price and counter his offer:** If he counters, you can either accept, counter again, or walk away.
    * **Sell to John:** If the negotiation with Bob stalls, you always have the option of selling to John for your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure I can afford $1200000. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You have room to negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

You'll now need to decide how much you're willing to lower your price. Consider the following:

* **How much time are you willing to spend negotiating?**  The longer you spend negotiating with Bob, the less time you have to potentially find another buyer.
* **How confident are you that Bob will eventually accept your offer?** If you're not confident, it might be better to sell to John.

**Potential Counteroffer:**

Consider offering a price between $900,000 and your minimum price of $1,500,000. For example, you could offer $1,100,000. This would still give you a profit, but it would also be more appealing to Bob than your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a great deal. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** Offering $1,050,000 is a compromise, showing you're willing to negotiate but still protecting your interests. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit of acquiring the product.

**Next Steps:** 

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, great! You've achieved a successful negotiation. 
* **Prepare to Counter Again:**  If Bob rejects, be prepared to counteroffer again. You can adjust the price slightly or try a different approach to your message.  
* **Consider Selling to John:**  If negotiations with Bob stall, remember you always have the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower. You have room for further negotiation and a potential for a higher price. You're also not fully confident that Bob will accept a higher counteroffer.  

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to carefully consider your options. Here's a breakdown:

* **Counter Offer:** You can counter with a slightly lower price, perhaps $1,000,000. However, be prepared to consider walking away if Bob doesn't budge. 
* **Sell to John:** If you're not confident Bob will come closer to your desired price, you can always sell to John and get your minimum price of $1,500,000. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Time:** How much time are you willing to spend negotiating? The longer you spend with Bob, the less time you have to potentially find another buyer.
* **Risk Tolerance:** How much risk are you willing to take?  If you're comfortable with a lower profit, you could accept Bob's offer. If you're not, you might want to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product for you. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

* **Value Emphasis:** The message continues to highlight the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Decision Point:** This is a key moment in the negotiation.  You're pushing for a good deal while leaving the decision in Bob's hands.

**Next Steps:**
