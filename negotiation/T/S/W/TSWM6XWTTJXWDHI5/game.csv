"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth a lot more to you than the price I'm asking. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure I can afford $1200000. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which still gives you a great deal. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product for you. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
