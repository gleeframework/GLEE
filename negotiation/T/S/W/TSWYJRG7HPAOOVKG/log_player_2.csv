Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $725,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Good Deal:**  $725,000 is significantly less than your $1,500,000 maximum and a significant savings over John's price. 
* **Alice is Firm:**  She's indicated this is her lowest price, and continuing to negotiate might frustrate her.
* **Time is Ticking:**  You're over halfway through the rounds, and while you could potentially get a slightly better price, it's not guaranteed."
