"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120.
* Alice is offering $90, which is a good price, but you can likely get it for less. 
* By rejecting, you open the opportunity for a counteroffer and potential for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $85?  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $92.50 is still above your target of $80.
* You're willing to pay up to $120, but you're aiming to save as much as possible.
* There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer again and potentially reach a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle on $87.50?  That's a good compromise for both of us, and it lets me get the product without breaking the bank."", ""product_price"": 87.5}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $87.50. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $91.25. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's final offer of $91.25 is still a good deal for you.
* You're willing to pay up to $120 and have already negotiated a lower price.
* There's a risk that Alice might not budge further, and buying from John would cost you more. 
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a price you're comfortable with."
