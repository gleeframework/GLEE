Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000, Alice wants to see if she can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but slightly below John's offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate or counter-offer.
* **High Value Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price, potentially swaying Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know Bob's negotiation style or financial constraints.  A very high price might deter him completely.
* **Alternative Strategies:** Alice could use other strategies, like a tiered offer with bonuses to incentivize Bob further."
