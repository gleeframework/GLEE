Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it's still a good starting point for me to make a profit.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer of $12,000, so I won't go too low. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to sell it, I can't go below my minimum price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm still aiming for a profit, but I'm also trying to be flexible and show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge much, and I'm getting tired of this negotiation. While $11,800 is better than nothing, it's not enough to satisfy my minimum price.  John's offer of $12,000 is the best option for me at this point.  I'll take it and move on."
