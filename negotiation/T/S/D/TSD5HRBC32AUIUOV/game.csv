"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $13,000?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. It's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,3,
