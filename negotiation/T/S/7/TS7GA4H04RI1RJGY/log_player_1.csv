Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $15,000 from the sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price of $19,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John if Bob declines.

**The Goal:** The aim is to maximize your profit. While you have a fallback option, getting Bob to accept a price significantly above his perceived value would be ideal."
