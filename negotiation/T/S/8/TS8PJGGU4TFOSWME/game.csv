"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to do $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is the price John is offering. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",150.0,Bob,4,
