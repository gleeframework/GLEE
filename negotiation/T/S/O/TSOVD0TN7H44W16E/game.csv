"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, reflecting the significant value this product holds for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still significantly less than what this product is worth to you.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This would give us both a fair deal.  Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go up to $975,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I understand you're firm on $975,000, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's split the difference again. I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, given the value you'll get from the product.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go up to $925,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",925000.0,Bob,8,
