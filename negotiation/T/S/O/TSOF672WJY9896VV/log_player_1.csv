"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I think this price accurately reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Leaving Room:** While the price is high, it's not unreasonable considering Bob's $1,000,000 valuation. This gives him an incentive to counter-offer rather than walking away.

I'm prepared to negotiate down if needed, but my initial goal is to secure a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message indicates he's motivated and sees the product's value. I'm willing to counter-offer in hopes of closing the deal closer to $900,000.  I'm not ready to settle for his price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is lower than I'm aiming for.  Would you consider $900,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm splitting the difference between his offer and my previous price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Holding Ground:** While I'm open to negotiation, I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower than $900,000. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation collaborative, emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm not quite there yet, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $875,000?  That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $875,000 is a good price, exceeding my minimum by a significant margin.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle demonstrates his commitment to closing the deal. 
* **Time Factor:**  While I have rounds remaining, there's always a risk Bob could walk away. Accepting now secures a substantial profit. 
 
Overall, this offer represents a favorable outcome for both parties and it's prudent to accept."
