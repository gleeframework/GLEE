"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I think this price accurately reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is within your budget, it's still a high price.  There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price, but still leaves room for compromise.  It's important to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is lower than I'm aiming for.  Would you consider $900,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $900,000 is still a bit high.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get it even lower.  While I'm happy to move closer to a deal, I'm not yet ready to accept it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm not quite there yet, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $875,000?  That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's last offer and my previous offer. By meeting in the middle, I show that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm on my desire to pay a lower price."
