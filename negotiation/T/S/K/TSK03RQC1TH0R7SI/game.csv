"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $11,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",11500.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you accept that?",10000.0,Bob,4,,
