Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000), I aim to anchor his perception of the product's worth at a higher point. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial high price provides a buffer for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and I can strategically lower the price while still aiming for a final sale price well above my minimum.
* **Backup Option:**  The fact that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell at any cost. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and any counter-offers he makes."
