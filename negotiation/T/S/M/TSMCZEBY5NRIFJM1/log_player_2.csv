"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, and I believe it presents a fantastic opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $950,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. There are 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in the product and believe a price of $850,000 would be fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable number."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To further explore a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $900,000 is closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation. He can try to get a lower price in the next round by making another counteroffer.  There are still 7 rounds left, so he has time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $875,000. This price would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  Let's work together to finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to find a common ground, Bob. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $890,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests and could lead to a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $890,000 is a very good price, especially considering he's already saved $310,000 from his initial goal. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether, especially since there are only 5 rounds remaining.  There's no guarantee he can get a better offer, and buying from John would cost him significantly more."
