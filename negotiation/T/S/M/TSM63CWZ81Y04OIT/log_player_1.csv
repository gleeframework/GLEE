Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'd like to get even closer to my target. Can you consider $1,350,000?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,300,000. How about $1,350,000?

With only two rounds left, Bob is still not willing to go higher than $1,350,000.  That's below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'm not sure I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next two rounds, so I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
