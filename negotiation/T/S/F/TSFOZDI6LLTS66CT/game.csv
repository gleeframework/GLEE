"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is still a great price for the product and leaves us both with a good profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
