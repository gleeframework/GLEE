"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the investment for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still allows for some negotiation room. It's important to start with a strong offer to demonstrate your commitment to saving money.  $9,500 is a good starting point, as it's closer to your maximum budget and leaves space for Alice to potentially counter with a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is still a great price for the product and leaves us both with a good profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. While it is closer to your target price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you can continue to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $10,000.  That's my absolute maximum, and it would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to go that low."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your final attempt to secure the product at your maximum price. It directly addresses Alice's previous offer and reiterates your commitment to purchasing at $10,000. This approach aims to push Alice towards accepting your final offer."
