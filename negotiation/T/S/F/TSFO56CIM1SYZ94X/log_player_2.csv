"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this incredible product with you, Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is an exceptional value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than what you'd pay John ($1,200,000).  Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000."
