Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value by mentioning you're offering it to Bob *before* going public. This hints at its desirability and could make the price more palatable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob to share his thoughts, opening the door for counter-offers.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net at $12,000, this strategy aims to maximize profit by potentially securing a deal above your minimum acceptable price."
