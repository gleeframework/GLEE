"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the value you've indicated, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This seems fair given both our needs. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob,  I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,150,000, which still reflects the significant value this product offers you.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
