"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $14,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",15000.0,Bob,4,
