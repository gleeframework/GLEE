Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still below my minimum ($1,000,000). This allows for negotiation space while ensuring I don't immediately undervalue my product.
* **Positive message:**  A positive and encouraging message aims to keep Bob engaged and open to negotiation.
* **Room for compromise:** There's room for me to lower the price a bit if necessary, but I have a backup plan with John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer signals that I'm not desperate and willing to compromise, which can lead to a higher counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not accepting his offer but also not rejecting him completely. I'm making a counteroffer closer to his price but still above my minimum.
* **Middle ground:**  Suggesting a middle ground shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still maintaining a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Positive tone:** Keeping the message friendly and focused on a ""fair price"" for both parties helps maintain a good rapport during negotiations."
