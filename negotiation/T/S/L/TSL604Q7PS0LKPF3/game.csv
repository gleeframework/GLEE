"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
