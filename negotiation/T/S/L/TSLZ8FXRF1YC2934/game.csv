"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $800,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Alice,5,
