Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product ($12,000) but lower than my minimum desired price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price. While I'm open to negotiation, $10,500 is simply too low. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12250}
