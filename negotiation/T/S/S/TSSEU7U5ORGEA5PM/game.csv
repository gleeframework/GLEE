"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $110 for it.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about $125?  That's closer to my budget and a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit higher than your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $127. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",127.0,Alice,5,
