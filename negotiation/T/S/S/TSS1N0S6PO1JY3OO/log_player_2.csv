"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $10,000.** 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer.** You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. 
* **Buying from John is your last resort**, and you should only do it if you can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the price, but I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $8,750 is within your budget of $10,000.**
* **This is a better deal than buying from John for $10,000.** 
* **While you could try to counter-offer again, the risk is that Alice could reject your offer and you might end up having to pay the full $10,000 from John.**  It's better to secure a good price within your budget rather than risk a worse outcome."
