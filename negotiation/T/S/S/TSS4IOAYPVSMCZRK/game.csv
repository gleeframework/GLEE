"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  $750,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference at $850,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow both of us to walk away with a win.  I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.
