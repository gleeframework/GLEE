"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $60. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I believe this price is reasonable considering the product's value to Alice ($150) and my own budget of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $80 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can get it for lower with continued negotiation. I'm confident I can secure a better price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $70. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's last offer. I believe this price is fair, considering both our desired outcomes and the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is getting closer to my limit, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation, especially since I have several rounds left.  Additionally, buying from John for $100 is still a viable option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $75. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's last offer. I believe this price is fair, considering both our desired outcomes and the remaining rounds.  I'm approaching my upper limit, but I believe I can still get a better deal than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is getting very close to my budget limit.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice within the remaining rounds is high.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $100, ensuring a deal within my budget."
