"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the value you'll get from it.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted rate.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,200 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,700? I feel this is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",8700.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,700. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9100.0,Alice,7,
