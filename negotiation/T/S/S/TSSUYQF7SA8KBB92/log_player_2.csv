Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,700. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  While you could push for a slightly better price, accepting at $9,100 is a reasonable deal compared to John's $12,000 offer."
