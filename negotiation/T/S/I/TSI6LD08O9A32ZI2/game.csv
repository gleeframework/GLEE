"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but  $600,000 is closer to my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $900,000?  That gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $700,000 is still significantly below what I can accept.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still offers you a great deal and ensures I can make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",850000.0,Alice,5,
