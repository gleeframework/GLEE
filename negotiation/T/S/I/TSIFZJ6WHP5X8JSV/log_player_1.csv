Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to sell ourselves short.  Starting with a price higher than his perceived value gives us room to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value and demand,"" we create a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Alternative Option:**  We implicitly remind Bob that he's not our only option by mentioning ""listing it publicly."" This creates a subtle sense of urgency.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  We don't know how willing Bob is to negotiate. He might outright reject this offer, but it gives us a starting point. 
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:** This message opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, giving us more information to work with."
