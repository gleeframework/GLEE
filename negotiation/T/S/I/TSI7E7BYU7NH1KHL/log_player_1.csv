"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" and ""significant returns,"" you're focusing on its benefits rather than just the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in multi-round bargaining.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will indicate how far apart your valuations are.
2. **Maximize potential profit:** Even if he counters much lower, you have space to work with.
3. **Maintain the option of John:** You haven't committed too low, allowing you to walk away to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and your initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. 

While his offer is low, it indicates interest in the product. You have room to negotiate upwards over the remaining rounds, aiming to reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reject:** You acknowledge Bob's offer to maintain a positive negotiation environment but clearly state it's unacceptable.
* **Significant Drop, But Above Target:**  You've decreased your price by $400,000, showing flexibility. However, the new price is still $300,000 above your minimum acceptable amount, giving you negotiating room.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":**  This framing, even though not a true middle point, encourages Bob to move closer to your price. 
* **Reiterating Value:** You're subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits, justifying the higher price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Signal seriousness but flexibility:** You're serious about selling but willing to negotiate for a win-win.
2. **Move towards a favorable price:** Your counteroffer encourages Bob to raise his offer significantly.
3. **Maintain John Option:**  You're still far enough above your minimum to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the product's value, I have a budget I need to stick to. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, $700,000 is still significantly below your $1,500,000 minimum.  Importantly, his message suggests he's willing to go higher (""significant investment"" and ""fair price"" imply wiggle room). You have six rounds left, giving you time to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your budget constraints are understandable. To be direct, I can't accept anything below $1,500,000 for this. It's a final offer, but it reflects the true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're being transparent with your absolute minimum price, eliminating uncertainty and conveying seriousness. 
* **Justification:** You're re-emphasizing the product's value while positioning your offer as beneficial for both parties.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Presenting it as a ""final offer"" encourages Bob to act decisively.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Elicit Bob's final move:** He either needs to make a substantial jump towards your price or walk away.
2. **Maintain credibility:**  You've been flexible up to this point, so being firm now is believable.
3. **John option remains open:** You're at your walk-away point, minimizing potential losses."
