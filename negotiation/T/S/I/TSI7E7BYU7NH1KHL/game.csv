"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant returns you'll see.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the product's value, I have a budget I need to stick to. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your budget constraints are understandable. To be direct, I can't accept anything below $1,500,000 for this. It's a final offer, but it reflects the true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
