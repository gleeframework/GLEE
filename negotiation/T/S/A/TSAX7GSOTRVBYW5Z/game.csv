"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12000. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
