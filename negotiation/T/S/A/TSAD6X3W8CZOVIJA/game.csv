"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Bob,4,,
