**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's better to reject and try for a lower price. There's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a better deal if I continue the process."
