"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you and my budget.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can offer the product to you for $15,500. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
