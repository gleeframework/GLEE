Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return you'll see on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value"" and ""potential"" aims to shift Bob's focus from the price tag to the potential benefits, justifying the high cost.

By taking this approach, Alice maximizes her chances of either:

1. **Securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value.**
2. **Proceeding with John, her guaranteed buyer, at her desired price.**"
