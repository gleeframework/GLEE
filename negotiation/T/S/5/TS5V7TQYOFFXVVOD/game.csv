"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is too low for me. This product is worth a significant amount more. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
