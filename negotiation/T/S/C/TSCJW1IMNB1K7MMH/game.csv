"Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $130 at this point. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $145. If we can meet in the middle, I think we can make this work.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $155. This is a fair compromise considering the value I'm offering. Let's close this deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
