"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love! I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a high starting price, knowing the product is worth more to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $120 is a good starting point because it allows for some negotiation while still providing me with a decent profit.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than $80 from John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by offering a compromise price.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I emphasize a ""good deal"" for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
