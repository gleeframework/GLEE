"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $85 just wouldn't work for me. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $92.50 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?  I'm very interested in your product and believe we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $90 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm really hoping to get closer to $95.  Is there any wiggle room in your budget? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",95.0,Alice,5,
