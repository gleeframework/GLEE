"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit more than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  It's important to leave some wiggle room for potential counteroffers. I don't want to alienate Bob right away by asking for my full minimum.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob, rather than just focusing on my needs. This helps build a more collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Reasoning:** While Bob is interested, he's clearly trying to negotiate a lower price. I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price point. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $85 just wouldn't work for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a compromise price of $92.50, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85.
* **Empathy:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns to maintain a positive rapport. 
* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum acceptable price. It demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation, but not willing to undervalue my product. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm focusing on finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $92.50 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?  I'm very interested in your product and believe we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'm not willing to sell for less than $120 if I can avoid it.
* **Reasoning:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or John.  I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if Bob will increase his offer further.
* **Next Steps:** I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer and try to find a middle ground or potentially sell to John if things don't work out."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $90 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm really hoping to get closer to $95.  Is there any wiggle room in your budget? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm proposing $95, which is closer to my desired price but still shows flexibility.
* **Reasoning:** Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, and I want to push for a price closer to my desired range. I'm not completely shutting the door on a deal with him.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential value of the product to him to encourage him to reconsider his offer.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and persuasive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
