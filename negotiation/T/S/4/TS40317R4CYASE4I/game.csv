"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this works for you!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with. Let me know if this works for you!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is as close to my minimum price as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is acceptable to you!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
