"Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's something you value highly, and I'm confident it would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for me while still offering you a significant saving compared to what it's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!",11500.0,Alice,1,
