"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's something you value highly, and I'm confident it would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for me while still offering you a significant saving compared to what it's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than your maximum price of $12,000, it's still higher than what John is offering. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for a counter-offer, potentially closer to the $10,000 value it holds for her. Even if she doesn't budge, you're not losing anything by trying to negotiate a better deal before defaulting to John's offer."
