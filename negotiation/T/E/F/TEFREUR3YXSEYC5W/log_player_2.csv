"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is below Bob's limit, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to push for a more favorable deal.  $13,000 is still above Alice's desired selling price, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm hoping to get closer to $14,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $13,500 is very close to Bob's target price of $13,000. It's a good deal considering his alternative is to pay $15,000 from John.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better price, but it also risks Alice walking away or Bob losing time and potentially having to pay more from John. 
* **Saving Money:** While not the lowest possible price, accepting the offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to John's offer."
