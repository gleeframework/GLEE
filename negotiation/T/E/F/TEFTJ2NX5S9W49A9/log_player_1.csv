Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion.
* **John as a Backup:**  The existence of John, willing to pay my minimum, gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Opportunity for a better counteroffer:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to sway him towards a higher price.
* **Negotiation Space:**  Leaving some room for further negotiation can encourage Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Risk of Losing a Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer might lead to further negotiation, but it also risks losing a sale altogether.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could take time and effort, potentially leading to a delay in receiving payment.  Selling to Bob now is a more efficient option."
