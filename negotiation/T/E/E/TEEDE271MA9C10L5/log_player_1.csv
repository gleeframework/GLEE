Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make this a smooth transaction. I propose a price of $925,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A slightly lower initial offer ($925,000) gives Bob the impression of a deal and leaves space for potential counter-offers.
* **Time Value:**  While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, a quicker sale to Bob at a higher price might be more beneficial overall. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, giving Alice a strong chance of securing the best possible outcome."
