"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $14,000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and secure a good price for myself.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the product's worth to emphasize its potential value to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $14,000 is a reasonable starting point that allows for a back-and-forth with Bob. 
* **Maintaining the option of selling to John:** This price is still significantly better than John's offer, giving me the flexibility to walk away if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below my starting offer. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is too low, his message indicates he is genuinely interested and willing to negotiate.  
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially reach a higher price in the next rounds. 
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't eliminate the option of selling to John, giving me a strong fallback position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still gives you a great price, and it's fair considering the product's value. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Keeping the negotiation moving:**  By offering a counteroffer, I'm actively trying to reach an agreement with Bob.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $13,000 is above my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Maintaining John as an option:**  If Bob rejects again, I can still sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Bob will walk away, and I might not get a better offer from him in the remaining rounds.
* **Limited negotiating leverage:** With only 6 rounds left, my bargaining power is diminishing, and it's unlikely I'll be able to significantly increase the price further.
* **John as a safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if needed, providing a safety net. 

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer is the most practical decision considering the current circumstances.  It allows me to secure a sale while minimizing potential losses and leaving the door open to explore alternative options if needed."
