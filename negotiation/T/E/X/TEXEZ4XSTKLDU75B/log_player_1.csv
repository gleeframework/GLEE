"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start high to see if Bob is truly interested and to what extent."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take $900,000,  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see how he responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving room for negotiation.  $1,200,000 is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal!  While it's only $50,000 more than selling to John, it's still a profit and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob by continuing to counteroffer."
