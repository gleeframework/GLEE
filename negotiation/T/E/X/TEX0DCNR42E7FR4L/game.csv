"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's something that could potentially increase your profits by a considerable amount. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the fact that I could easily sell it to another buyer for a lower price. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",900000.0,Alice,1,
