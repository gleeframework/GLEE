"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still within the realm of reason given my own valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to negotiation, which will be crucial for reaching an agreement.
* **Building a Relationship:** I'm being friendly and encouraging dialogue to avoid a quick rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great price for a product of this caliber. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm firmly stating my minimum price point, but using language that avoids sounding inflexible.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify my price.
* **Collaborative Approach:**  I'm emphasizing that I want to find a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1500000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1300000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I believe I can still get a better price through further negotiation.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $1,300,000 is closer, but it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By meeting Bob halfway again, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still holding firm on my bottom line. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""final offer"" and ""other options"" subtly increases pressure on Bob to accept, as he knows I'm willing to walk away.
* **Positive Tone:**  Ending with ""Let's make this happen!"" conveys optimism and encourages Bob to find a way to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're now at Round 6, and the negotiation has stalled. Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've already made significant concessions.  To avoid further delays and ensure I get a price that's fair to me, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
