"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can do better than $90.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I need to make a profit. I can do $88, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.

While I'd prefer to pay less, Alice's offer of $88 is still within my budget and better than buying from John. It's a good deal for me, especially since I know the product is worth $80 to her."
