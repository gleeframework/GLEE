Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true value and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's always best to aim for the highest possible profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, but that doesn't mean that's his absolute ceiling. By starting high at $1,500,000, we test Bob's willingness to pay a premium. 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  Even if Bob negotiates down, we're starting from a position of strength and could still secure a price significantly higher than $1,000,000.
* **Risk assessment:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, we haven't lost anything. We can always return with a lower price, knowing John provides a safety net.
* **Anchoring bias:** By presenting the high price first, we ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. This can make subsequent offers, even if lower, seem more reasonable.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
