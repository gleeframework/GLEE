Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,000,000) to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's unique value to encourage Bob to see its potential worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price further. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup buyer at $800,000, so I'm not pressured to sell below my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counteroffer or move on to John."
