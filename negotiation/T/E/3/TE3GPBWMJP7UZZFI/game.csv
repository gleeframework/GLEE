,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you consider $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to make a good profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle on $125? This would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $128. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product offers. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,5,
