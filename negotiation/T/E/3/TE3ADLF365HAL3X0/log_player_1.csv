Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to acquire a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,500,000 (because John guarantees that price).
* **Creating Value for Bob:** Offering the product for $1,300,000 leaves a potential $500,000 ""on the table"" for Bob. This creates a strong incentive for him to buy, as he stands to gain significantly. 
* **Maximizing Your Gain:** By starting at $1,300,000, you're aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation while leaving room for negotiation if needed.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances the risk with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
