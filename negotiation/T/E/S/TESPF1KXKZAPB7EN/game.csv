"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $18000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $16000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle anytime soon. I'm willing to pay $12000, but I need you to meet me at that price. Can you do that?",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to sell the product for $12000, Bob. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $12000. I can offer you the product for $14000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $13500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious offer of $11000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at $11000.",11000.0,Bob,10,
