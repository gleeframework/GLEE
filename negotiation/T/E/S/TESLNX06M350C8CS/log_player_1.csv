Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  A higher price means more profit for me.
* **John as a safety net:** Since John is willing to pay $1,500,000, I have a safety net. If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed to make a profit.
* **Negotiation leverage:** Offering a higher price might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he agrees. It also creates room for negotiation if he counters with a lower offer.

Let's see if Bob bites!"
