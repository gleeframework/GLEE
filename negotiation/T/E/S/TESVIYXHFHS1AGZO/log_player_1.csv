Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $900,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a valuable product. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's too early to sell to John.  While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my goal of $1,500,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I propose a price of $1,000,000. This is the highest I can go while still making sense for my financial situation. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

$1,000,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not happy with the offer. I want to see if I can push for a bit more before selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $1,000,000 just isn't enough for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? I'm sure we can both walk away from this deal feeling good about it."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and I believe $1,000,000 is the maximum I can afford without compromising my financial stability. I'm sorry, but I can't go above that. I hope we can find a way to meet somewhere in between these figures.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm at $1,000,000. While it's a decent amount, it's still far from my minimum.  I'm losing valuable time and I don't see any indication that Bob will budge further.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed $1,500,000."
