"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It aligns perfectly with your current needs and could potentially lead to substantial growth for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer at the same price.  Rejecting the offer keeps your options open."
