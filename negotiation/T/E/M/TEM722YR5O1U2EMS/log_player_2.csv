"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's starting price is way too high. It's important to negotiate a much lower price to get closer to my $100 limit."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While I agree the product looks great, $200 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $100 for it?"",

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

Alice is coming down, but $150 is still too high. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
