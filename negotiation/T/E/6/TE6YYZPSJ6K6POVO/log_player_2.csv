Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid it's still below the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings to the table.

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still outside my budget. I'll try another counteroffer."

Alice is still too high for my budget.  At this point, John's offer is the best option to ensure I get the product within my budget."
