Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1500000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm very interested, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

This is a significant increase from my initial offer and represents a fair compromise, considering my budget limitations.  I hope we can find common ground here.
