"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground here.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $7,000 is a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above your offer at $7,750. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
