"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is well above my maximum budget of $8,000. It's best to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. It's important to show that I'm serious about buying the product but also demonstrate that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. This sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm not willing to go above my limit of $8,000, so I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm eager to get this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below my maximum of $8,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but am still firm on my price limit. It also puts the pressure on her to make the next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $9,000. I'm counteroffering at $9,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,800 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  While we've made some progress in the negotiation, I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement within my budget in the remaining rounds.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product, it's best to buy it from John for $8,000."
