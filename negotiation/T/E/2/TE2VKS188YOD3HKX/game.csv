"I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable product that I believe you'll really appreciate. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. It's a one-time offer, so I'd love to hear your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider my other options.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000, but I'm willing to make a small concession. I can meet you at $15,500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
