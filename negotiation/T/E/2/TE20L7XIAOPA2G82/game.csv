"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and also fits within your budget.  Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $10,000? This is the absolute lowest I can go, but it's still a good price for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit short on budget, so I was thinking $9,200 would be a sweet spot for me. Can you consider that?",9200.0,Bob,6,
