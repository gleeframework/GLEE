Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, hoping to get a good deal.  It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum, so I'll accept it.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price and having to go through the hassle of a negotiation."
