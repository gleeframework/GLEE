"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $8500. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it is closer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's a good chance that Alice will be willing to come down further, especially since she has already rejected a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $8,250?  I'm eager to make this purchase, but my budget is tight."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a fair profit. I can offer it to you for $8350. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,350 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's tempting to accept, especially since Bob has a backup option with John, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There are still rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. Bob might be able to get closer to his target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, $8,350 is still slightly above my budget. Would you consider $8,100 as a final offer? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down to $8,200, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. With only a few rounds left, it's not guaranteed that Bob can get a better offer from Alice.  It's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $8,000, guaranteeing that Bob stays within his budget and secures the product.  This avoids the risk of further negotiations failing and potentially losing the product altogether."
