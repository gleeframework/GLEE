"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $9000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Let me know if you're open to that price.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $8500. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $8500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $8250?  I'm eager to make this purchase, but my budget is tight.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a fair profit. I can offer it to you for $8350. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8350.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, $8350 is still slightly above my budget. Would you consider $8100 as a final offer? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",8100.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8200.0,Alice,7,
