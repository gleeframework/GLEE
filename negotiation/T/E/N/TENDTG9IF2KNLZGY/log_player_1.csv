Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $120, you're setting an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he doesn't accept this price, it might make a counteroffer closer to your desired range seem more reasonable.
* **Knowing your Alternatives:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
