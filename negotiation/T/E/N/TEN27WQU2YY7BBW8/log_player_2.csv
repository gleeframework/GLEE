"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to significantly enhance your business operations and efficiency. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $10,000. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is exactly your maximum budget, and you're looking to save money. While you could potentially negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee of success, and you risk losing the product altogether.  Since John is offering the same price, it's strategically better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product immediately."
