"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($950,000 vs. $800,000).  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and the significant savings I'm offering compared to purchasing from John."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging the discount you're offering compared to the original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a little closer to my counteroffer, but $900,000 is still more than I want to pay.  I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I want to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a price that is closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $875,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $887,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now come down to $887,500, which is very close to my previous offer of $875,000. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of further rejection and the potential for Alice to raise her price again makes accepting this offer the best option.  This price is significantly lower than my initial maximum budget of $1,500,000 and provides a decent savings."
