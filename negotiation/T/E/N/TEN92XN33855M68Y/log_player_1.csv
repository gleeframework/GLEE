"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'm aware Bob values it at $8,000, so I expect him to counter.  We have 10 rounds, so I can afford to be aggressive.  However, I also have the option to sell to John for $10,000, so I won't risk losing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.  I have 8 rounds left and the option of selling to John, so I'm not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm lowering the price to $9,500, aiming for a compromise. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's within Bob's range of willingness to pay. I'm still keeping the option to sell to John in mind if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer, but $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm going to reject his offer again.  I have 6 rounds left before I have to choose John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm lowering the price again to $9,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm ready to counter again if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John. I'm running out of rounds, but I'm still confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900} 
```

I'm dropping the price to $8,900. This is my final offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm ready to sell to John if he doesn't. I'm losing a significant amount of profit if I sell to John, but I'm running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of rounds and Bob is not budging. I'm not willing to lose more money by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John for $10,000 is the best option at this point. It's a significant loss, but it's better than getting $8,800."
