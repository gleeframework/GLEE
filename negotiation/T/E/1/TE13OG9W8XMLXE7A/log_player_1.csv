Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but well below my minimum value ($150). This gives him some room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Leaving space for negotiation allows for potential counteroffers and a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $150 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John, guaranteeing my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a price closer to $125 or even higher. 
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $150 is always an option, but I want to maximize my profit by continuing negotiations with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $115 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price that considers your budget while still allowing me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($115) and my previous offer ($125). 
* **Appealing to Reason:**  I frame my offer as fair, highlighting the balance between Bob's budget and my profit needs.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm staying above my minimum value of $150, ensuring I'm not selling at a loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $110. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowball Offer:** Bob's offer of $110 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's tempting to continue negotiations, I'm running the risk of losing too much money.
* **Time is Money:** Each negotiation round takes time, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. 
* **Minimizing Loss:**  By selling to John, I ensure a profit, even if it's not the maximum possible.  Continuing with Bob would only increase the chance of getting stuck with a lower price or a longer negotiation process."
