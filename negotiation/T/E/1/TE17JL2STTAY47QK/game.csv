"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is closer to my budget. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than what I'd like to get for the product. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $92. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",92.0,Alice,5,
