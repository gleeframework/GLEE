Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant profit for me and still leaves Bob with a good deal, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to him. 

I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he rejects it.  I'll keep John's offer of $800,000 in mind as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $1,000,000. I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000.  This is a compromise that meets him halfway, and still gives me a significant profit. I believe this offer is fair and reasonable, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my target of $1,000,000,  $925,000 is still a very good price, and it's likely that Bob won't budge further.  It's also worth noting that  continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob completely and being forced to sell to John for a much lower price."
