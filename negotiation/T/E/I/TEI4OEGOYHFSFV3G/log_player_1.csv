"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation but still secure a good profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum threshold of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $75 is getting closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm going to counter with $82. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to move closer to my minimum price while still leaving some room for profit."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

I'm going to counter with $80, which is my minimum price. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob is willing to pay $80 for the product.  Hopefully, he'll accept this offer and we can close the deal."
