"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum price. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves you with a substantial profit margin and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you can't go as low as my previous offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
