Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while ensuring I stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""final_price"": 13000}"
