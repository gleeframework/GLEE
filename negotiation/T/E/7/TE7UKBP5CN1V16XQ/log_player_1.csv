Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd potentially gain $200,000 in value if he buys it. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer it for a price closer to $800,000, aiming closer to his valuation increases the chance of a significant profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Backup Offer:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John."
