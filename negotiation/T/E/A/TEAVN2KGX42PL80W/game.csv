"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad to hear that you're interested in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $8,500, as it's still a bit below my target. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8,750? It's closer to your offer and still within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $8,750 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $9,500? I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to sell the product to you at this point.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I value the product, $9,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is closer to your last offer and still within my budget.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $9,500, but I'll throw in a small sweetener - I'll include a free upgrade that adds significant value to the product. This way, you'll be getting an even better deal than before. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you adding the upgrade, but $9,500 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250, but I need to be sure about the value of the upgrade. Can you provide more details about what it includes and how it will benefit me?  If it's a significant improvement, I'm more open to a price closer to $9,500. If not, we might need to find another solution.",9250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm happy to provide more details about the upgrade. The upgrade includes a premium warranty, priority support, and a complimentary maintenance package that will save you money in the long run. I believe this adds significant value to the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, as I originally proposed. However, I'm willing to throw in an additional concession - I'll give you a 1-year subscription to our premium service, which normally costs $2,000. This way, you'll get the product, the upgrade, and the premium service for a total of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,9,
