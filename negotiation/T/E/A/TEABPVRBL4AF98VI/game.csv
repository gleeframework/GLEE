"I understand that $10,750 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a slight discount, though. How about we meet at $11,200? This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to reach an agreement.",11200.0,Alice,5,
