Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're making a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob rejects, you can adjust the price based on his counteroffer. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still making a deal that Bob is likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a good profit, it's worth trying to push for a higher price. You know the product is worth $150 to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great deal for a product that's worth so much to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$105 is a good price and is still above your minimum of $80.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation with Bob, especially since he's already come close to your desired price. You could continue to haggle, but there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you could potentially lose the deal altogether."
