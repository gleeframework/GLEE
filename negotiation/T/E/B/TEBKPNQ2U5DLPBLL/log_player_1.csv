Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, Bob is willing to pay more. My goal is to capture as much of that potential profit as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for me while still offering Bob a discount compared to his perceived value ($1,500,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, ensuring I don't leave money on the table."
