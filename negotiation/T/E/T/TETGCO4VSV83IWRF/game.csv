"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $115 is a bit above my budget. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still really interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $108. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",108.0,Bob,4,
