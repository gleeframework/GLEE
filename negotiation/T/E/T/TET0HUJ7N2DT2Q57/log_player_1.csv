Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm emphasizing that I'm open to discussion, making it less likely Bob will walk away immediately.
* **Value Proposition:**  While I don't know the product's value to Bob, hinting at its uniqueness could pique his interest. 

This strategy aims to:

* Gauge Bob's initial interest and willingness to negotiate.
* Potentially secure a price closer to my desired range.
* If Bob rejects, I have room to lower the price in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's initial interest suggests he's willing to negotiate. I want to see if I can secure a higher price through further counteroffers. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $8,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired range while still acknowledging his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,500?  This would be a fair price considering the unique value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $8,500 is a compromise, halfway between my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's offer ($7,000). 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the ""unique value"" of the product to subtly remind Bob of its worth.
* **Showing Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate while staying close to my minimum. 

**This strategy aims to:**

* Encourage Bob to accept a price closer to my desired range.
* Keep the negotiation going without immediately resorting to selling to John. 
* Assess Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 aligns with my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further room for negotiation:** While I could try for a slightly higher price, there's a high chance of a stalemate. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower price or a sale to John. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a fair price for the product without risking further negotiation and potential losses."
