"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1500000 for it. This is a fair price considering its potential. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in the product's value,  $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000, which I believe is a fair starting point considering my  maximum purchase limit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  I believe this price is fair considering the product's potential. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $950000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1075000. This price reflects the unique benefits this product offers, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering our previous negotiations. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1075000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1000000, which demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring this product. I believe this price is fair considering our ongoing negotiation and my willingness to meet you halfway. Let's find a solution that allows us both to move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
