"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still above my limit. Let's meet at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
