# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above my desired budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price.  There's still room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still above my limit. Let's meet at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
