"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $180 for the product.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $120, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $80?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $80, which is $100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $100 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to settle at $90?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the product's minimum value for me, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a compromise, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",110.0,Alice,7,
