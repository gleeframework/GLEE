"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. It's a great price, and I think you'll find it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and I pay $1,250,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free premium support package worth $50,000. That's a $50,000 value, absolutely free. So, the total value you'll be getting is $1,300,000. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
