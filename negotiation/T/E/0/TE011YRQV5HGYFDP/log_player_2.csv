Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation when you have a guaranteed option for $1,200,000 with John."
