"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit higher than I'd like. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and shows I'm serious about making this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach at this point.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
