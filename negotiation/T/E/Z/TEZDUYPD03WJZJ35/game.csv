"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to go beyond $1,400,000. I hope this revised offer meets somewhere in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could consider letting it go for $1,475,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
