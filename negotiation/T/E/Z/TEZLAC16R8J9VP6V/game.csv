"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. This amount aligns better with what I am able to spend while still allowing me to acquire a high-quality product. I look forward to your response.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
