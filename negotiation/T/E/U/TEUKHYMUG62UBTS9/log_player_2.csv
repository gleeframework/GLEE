Alice is sticking to her initial offer. While it's tempting to accept, we've already shown her that we're willing to negotiate. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."

```

Alice's offer is still higher than my last counteroffer, but it's getting closer to my range.  I'm going to try one last counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal. We're running out of time, and I don't want to risk ending up with John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm going to increase my bid to $890,000, which is just $20,000 less than Alice's last offer. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal but also still trying to save some money. Hopefully, she accepts."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire. It seems like Alice is not willing to budge further, and I'm not comfortable going any higher. To avoid running out of time and getting stuck with a higher price, I'll buy the product from John. It's not ideal, but it's the best option left to ensure I get the product."
