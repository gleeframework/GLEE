I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum value. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this amount. If not, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer, or move on to John if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll make a counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be a more acceptable price for both of us."
