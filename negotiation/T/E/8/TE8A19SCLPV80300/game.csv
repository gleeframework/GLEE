"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $120. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $120. Would you be willing to come down to $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. It's still a great deal for both of us, considering the value you place on it. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $135? ",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you $140. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
