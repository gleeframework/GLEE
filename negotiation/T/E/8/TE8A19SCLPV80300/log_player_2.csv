"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $170 is significantly higher than his $120 maximum value.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $120. Would you be willing to come down to $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. It's still a great deal for both of us, considering the value you place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $145 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown he's willing to walk away and has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $135? "", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you $140. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $120.  

* While Alice has come down in price, $140 is still above Bob's maximum value.
* He has already shown a willingness to walk away, and John offers a guaranteed price within his budget. 
* Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks getting stuck at a price higher than he's willing to pay, especially as he has a limited number of rounds."
