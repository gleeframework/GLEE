"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This gives you a great deal, and it's still a fair price for me.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little bit.  How about $11,000? That's a pretty significant jump from my last offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,000 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to at least get $12,000 for this. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
