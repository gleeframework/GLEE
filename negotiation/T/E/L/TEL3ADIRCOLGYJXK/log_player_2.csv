# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While the product might be valuable, Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  He can get the same product from John for a price that fits his budget."
