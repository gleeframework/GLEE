{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. You want to save money, so rejecting her offer is the best first step. You can then attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If Alice rejects, we can adjust our counteroffer based on her response."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your target. It's worth continuing the negotiation, as there's potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

We're increasing our counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that we're serious about buying the product, but are still determined to get a good price.  It's also a reasonable compromise, as it's halfway between our last offer and Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still a bit higher than what you'd pay John.  Given that you want to save as much money as possible, buying from John at $1,000,000 is the best option.  There's no guarantee that you'll be able to convince Alice to go lower, and further negotiation could just be a waste of time."
