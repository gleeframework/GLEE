"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I'm also being friendly and positive to build a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can get closer to my target by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to compromise a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value. Thank you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get at least $15,000. I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can push for a higher price. I'm also not too worried about John, as I have a few rounds to potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence. However, $14,000 is still a bit below what I need.  How about $15,500? This is a good middle ground for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of slowly moving towards my minimum price. $15,500 is a significant jump from Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping he'll see the value of the product and be willing to make a final compromise. I'm also reminding him of the value of the product and highlighting that this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and would like to counter with $15,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price given its value, and I hope you'll agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a great deal for me! I've achieved my minimum price of $15,000, and I've managed to secure a sale with Bob. While I could potentially try to get a higher price by continuing the negotiation, there's always the risk that Bob could back out, or that I might not get a better offer.  It's better to secure this deal and move on."
