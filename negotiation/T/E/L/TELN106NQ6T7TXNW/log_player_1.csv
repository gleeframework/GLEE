Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $12,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed backup offer of $12,000 from John. 

By offering $14,000, you are leaving some room for negotiation while ensuring you get a price higher than your minimum. This offer gives Bob a good deal while still allowing you to maximize your profit."
