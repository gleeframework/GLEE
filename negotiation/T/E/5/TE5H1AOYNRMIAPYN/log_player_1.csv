"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This offer is a good starting point, as it's below Bob's value but still gives me a good profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I can still aim for a better price.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one. It shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement and willing to be flexible, but still holding out for a higher price than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than what I aim for. I'll continue to negotiate for a higher price, as I'm not yet satisfied with the current offer. I still have rounds left and there's potential to reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

Since Bob's last offer was $13,000, I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between the two previous offers. This shows that I'm still willing to negotiate but am also firm on my desire to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is only $800 below my minimum acceptable price. With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely I can achieve a better offer from Bob. Accepting his offer is the best strategy to ensure I get a good deal and close the deal."
