"I'm excited to offer you the product for $1,500,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and gives you a fair profit.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a significant profit, and I think you'll find it's worth it to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, while also giving you a considerable profit.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
