"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'd need to be in a much lower price range. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would be a fair deal considering the product's potential.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but that's still higher than I'm comfortable with. To make this work, I'd need to see a price closer to $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $950,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I can tell this product means a lot to you, but that price is still a bit rich for me.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,050,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
