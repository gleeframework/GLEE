Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I can tell this product means a lot to you, but that price is still a bit rich for me.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,050,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob has steadily increased his offer and we're now at a price point that is a good compromise ($1,050,000). While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk Bob will walk away if we push further. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
