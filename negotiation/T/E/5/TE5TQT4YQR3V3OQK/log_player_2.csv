You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth starting a counteroffer to see if we can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135?

While $135 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $135 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm happy to go up to $115, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $115, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle between $135 and $115. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $125 is still more than I'm willing to pay. At this point, it's better to just buy from John for $100."
