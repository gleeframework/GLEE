"Alice, $2,000,000 is way above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $2,000,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a middle ground.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to make a purchase.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
