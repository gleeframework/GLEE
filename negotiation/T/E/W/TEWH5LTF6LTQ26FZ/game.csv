"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible.",10500.0,Bob,4,
