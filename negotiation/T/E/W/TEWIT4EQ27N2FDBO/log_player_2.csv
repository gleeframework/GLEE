"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $11500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you trying to work with me. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $10500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $11,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price. Let's try one more time to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $10900.  That's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and this price is closer to Bob's desired price point. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or him having to buy from John at a higher price is increasing. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that's within his budget and saves him money compared to buying from John."
