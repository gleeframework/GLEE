"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you trying to work with me. However, $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can agree on this.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $10500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $11000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10750. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price. Let's try one more time to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $10900.  That's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
