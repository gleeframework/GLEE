The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is far too high. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

I'm getting closer to my maximum price, but I'm still trying to get a better deal. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer as it's not too far from her last one. We're getting close to the point where it's more worthwhile to buy from John."
