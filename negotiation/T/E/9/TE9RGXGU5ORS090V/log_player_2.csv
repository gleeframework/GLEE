"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to both Bob and Alice, there's no immediate advantage to buying from Alice at this price. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price, potentially saving some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount of 20%. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This initial counteroffer also establishes a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. Buying the product for $11,000 saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, the risk of losing the deal or running out of rounds makes this offer attractive."
