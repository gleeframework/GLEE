"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",105.0,Alice,5,
