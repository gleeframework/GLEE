"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and we're looking to share the value. Our initial offer is $95 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my budget ($100) and Alice's initial ask ($95). This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a low number first, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I expect Alice to counter my offer, and I'm prepared to negotiate upward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. To better align with both our interests, we would like to propose an offer of $75 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice reducing her offer from $95 to $75 is a good sign, indicating she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** $75 is still significantly higher than my initial offer. There's a good chance we can meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Alternative Option:**  While John's offer of $100 is always an option, it's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to pay $68."",
""product_price"": 68
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting $68, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This price point is a significant jump from my previous offer of $60 but still keeps me well below Alice's last offer of $75. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation, so it's a good time to start nudging the price closer to my target range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. We're glad you're willing to meet us halfway. Considering our costs and the value proposition, we would like to suggest an offer of $72 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice is moving in the right direction, the increments are small. This suggests she might be trying to draw out the negotiation.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  We still have a few rounds left, giving us some leverage to push for a better deal. 
* **Target Price:** $72 is still a bit too high. I believe we can get closer to $70, if not lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To show you I'm serious, I can go up to $70.  But that's really as high as I can go."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm conveying that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also setting a clear limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying it's my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a subtle sense of urgency, hoping Alice will be more willing to accept.
* **Acceptable Outcome:**  While $70 isn't my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that still saves me a decent amount compared to John's offer or Alice's initial ask."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand your position and are committed to finding a mutually beneficial solution. We would like to propose an offer of $71 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $71. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $71
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains:** Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield significant savings at this point. Alice is moving in very small increments, and $1 difference is not worth the risk of the deal falling through. 
* **Time Investment:** We've already spent several rounds negotiating.  The time and effort involved in further haggling may not be justified for a small potential saving. 
* **Reasonable Price:** $71 is a fair compromise, saving us $29 compared to John's offer and $24 compared to Alice's initial offer."
