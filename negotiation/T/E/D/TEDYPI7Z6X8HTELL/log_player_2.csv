Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum price, but it's still above your desired range.  You have reached a point where the negotiation might be getting unproductive and you're close to your maximum price. It's wiser to buy from John at this point, as you're guaranteed to get the product for $1,200,000. Further negotiation might result in a lower price from Alice, but it also risks Alice walking away or the price going up again."
