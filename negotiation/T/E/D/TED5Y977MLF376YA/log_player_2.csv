"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always best to try and negotiate. Since the product is worth $15,000 to you, you have some room to bargain. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay full price and open the door for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range that you're willing to pay. This signals your serious intent to buy while also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the bargaining process going and potentially allows for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to increase your offer, showing Alice that you are serious about buying the product. It also leaves some room for further negotiation, as it's still below your maximum value and below Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to your maximum value. While there's still room for negotiation, the potential savings are small. It's more likely that further negotiation would drag the process out without yielding significant gains.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or you needing to buy from John at a higher price."
