"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well within your budget given the value it holds for you. Let's make this happen!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. It's not even close to what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,500,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. ",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,350,000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 still doesn't meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll gain. Let's finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but no more. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to getting this product. While I'm also committed to finding a fair deal, $1,300,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but I won't go any lower. This is a final offer, let's seal the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand this is a final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but no more. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you reconsider?",1320000.0,Bob,8,
