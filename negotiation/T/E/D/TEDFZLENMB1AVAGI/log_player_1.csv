Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  It leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  You're showing that you're confident in the product's value.

By starting with a strong offer, you can hopefully reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly below the $13,500 you offered, and you know the product is worth more to Bob than that. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, given the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? That's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's wise to accept Bob's offer. While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the negotiation process is getting longer and you risk losing the deal entirely. $11,500 is a good price, significantly higher than John's offer and still allows you to make a profit.  It's time to close the deal!"
