"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $10,000 and higher than John's offer. You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product is interesting, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range gives you room to negotiate.  It also lets Alice know you're serious about buying but need a price that works for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down in price, $10,500 is still more than you need to pay.  John is offering the product for $10,000. You should try one more time to negotiate a lower price with Alice, making it clear that John's offer is more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. I do have another offer for $10,000, so I'd be willing to close the deal with you at $9,500. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to go with the other offer."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer:

* **Is firm but fair:**  It shows Alice you're serious about the $10,000 alternative without being overly aggressive.
* **Creates a sense of urgency:**  By mentioning you'll go with the other offer, it encourages Alice to make a decision quickly.
* **Leaves room for a final compromise:** Even if Alice rejects $9,500, she might be willing to settle at $10,000."
