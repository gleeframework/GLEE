"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($11,500 < $12,000).**
* **Buying from Alice saves you $500 compared to buying from John.**

Even though you could get a slightly better deal by negotiating with Alice, accepting her offer is the most rational choice given the information provided. You get the product for less than your maximum budget and save money compared to the alternative."
