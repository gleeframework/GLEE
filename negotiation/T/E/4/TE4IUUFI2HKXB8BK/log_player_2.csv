"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you at a special price of $10,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's below my usual asking price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I will reject Alice's offer because buying from her for $10,000 would be $2,000 more than what I can get from John.
