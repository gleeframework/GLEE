Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested but $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $100?  That's still a good profit for you, and a great deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
