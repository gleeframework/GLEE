"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, while $130 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $120? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
