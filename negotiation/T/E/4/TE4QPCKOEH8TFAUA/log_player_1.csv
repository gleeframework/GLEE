Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to come down a bit,  $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $12750? I think that's a fair compromise considering my initial offer was already lower than your original price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of him walking away or me having to sell to John for less is too high.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and a sale."
