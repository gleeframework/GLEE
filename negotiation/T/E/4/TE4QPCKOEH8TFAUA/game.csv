"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you can meet me halfway.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to come down a bit,  $12000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $12750? I think that's a fair compromise considering my initial offer was already lower than your original price.",12750.0,Bob,4,
