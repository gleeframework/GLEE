Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of significant value."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation increases the likelihood of him accepting while maximizing your potential profit.  
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a high price and ensuring you don't lose him as a buyer, forcing you to settle for your minimum with John."
