"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair starting point for our discussion.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, your offer significantly undervalues its true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which I believe is a more than fair price considering the immense value it offers.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value is high, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we perhaps meet in the middle somewhere around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To show my willingness to find a solution, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,200,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,000,000?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
