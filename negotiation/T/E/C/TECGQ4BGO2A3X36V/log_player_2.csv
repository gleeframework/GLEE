"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start at a price of $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's even more than what the product is worth to her! I'll try to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit too steep for me, Alice.  How about we bring the price down to something more reasonable?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a low offer ($60) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. This strategy aims to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range.
* **Polite but Firm:** My message is polite but clearly signals that Alice's initial offer is unacceptable. I'm aiming for a collaborative negotiation, not a confrontational one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm still a bit above the $60 you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $105 is still more than I want to spend, especially when I have the option to buy from John for $100. I'll try to nudge her closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle right in the middle at $82.50?"",
""product_price"": 82.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Apparent Compromise):** By suggesting $82.50, I'm aiming to create a sense of compromise. This makes it appear like I'm meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($105) and my previous offer ($60). In reality, this is strategically edging closer to my target while seeming reasonable. 
* **Specific Number:** Using a specific number like $82.50 can sometimes make an offer feel more concrete and considered, potentially making Alice more likely to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $82.50. I'll offer you a price of $92.50, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting very close to John's price, but I'll try one more time to see if I can get a slightly better deal. There's no harm in trying before resorting to my backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice! I'm willing to go up a bit. How about $87.50, and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 87.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm showing Alice I'm willing to move, but only slightly, by increasing my offer to $87.50. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying ""and we have a deal,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency. It suggests I'm getting close to my limit and might not be willing to negotiate much further. 
* **Below John's Price:** It's crucial to stay below John's $100 offer. This way, I still have room to negotiate without exceeding my backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $87.50. I'll offer you a price of $90, which is a small step up from our last offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice's offer of $90 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and only slightly above my ideal price. 
* **Time Investment:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better result. It's better to accept a reasonable offer now than risk the price going up again or running out of rounds. 
* **Saving Compared to John:** While John offers the product for $100, securing it for $90 from Alice represents a $10 saving, which is a worthwhile outcome."
