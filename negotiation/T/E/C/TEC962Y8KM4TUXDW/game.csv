"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $50. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer Alice, but I'm still a ways off from that price point.  Would you be willing to consider $65?",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $65 is still a bit too low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $85. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
