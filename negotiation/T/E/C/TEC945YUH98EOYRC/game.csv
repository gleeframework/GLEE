"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.  I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go to $9,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
