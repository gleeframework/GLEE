"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $10,500?  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go above $9,500, and I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $10,000? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay.",10000.0,Bob,4,
