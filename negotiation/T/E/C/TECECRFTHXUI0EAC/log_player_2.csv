"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While Alice is trying to frame it as a good deal, it's still significantly above Bob's target price.  He has leverage by knowing he can secure the product from John for a much lower price, and should use that to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, but it allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's meet in the middle.

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer.  While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above his target. He can still get the product from John for a much lower price, and should continue to use that as leverage to get a better deal from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm going to make this my final offer.  $950,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This price still gives you a substantial value gain, and it's the closest I can come to your offer.  If you're serious about getting this product, I encourage you to accept.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. Even though Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still above his target.  He has a guaranteed way to get the product at a lower price, and it's in his best interest to take advantage of that. Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price lower than what John is offering."
