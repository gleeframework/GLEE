"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $100.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $95 is above my minimum value of $100. Accepting his offer is the best option in this situation as it secures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
