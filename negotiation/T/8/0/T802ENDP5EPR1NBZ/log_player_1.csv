"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the immense benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a strong perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the high initial price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The goal is to secure the highest possible price, and that often involves negotiation. This initial offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value, indicating room for negotiation. While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, there's potential to secure a better deal with Bob with some strategic counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $150,000 shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The counter-offer is still significantly above both Bob's initial offer and his perceived value, aiming for a higher final price.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's ""true value and potential"" reinforces the reasoning for the high price, subtly anchoring it in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and my willingness to purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 exceeds your guaranteed offer from John ($1,200,000), making it a profitable deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield small increments, while risking Bob walking away.  
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate returns, which is generally preferable in business."
