Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product's worth to you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $780,000. I can offer the product to you for $810,000. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final concession. While we could try to push further, there's a risk she'll hold firm, leaving us to choose between her offer and John's less favorable one. At $810,000, we're securing a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
