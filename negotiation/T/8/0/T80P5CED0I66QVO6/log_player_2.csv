"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still a bit high for him, and he has 9 more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to Alice's valuation as possible without exceeding his own limit. $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, considering his goal is to save money and Alice is likely to be motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than her initial offer, which is a bit unexpected. However, Bob is still willing to negotiate further. He has 7 rounds left and can potentially get a better price.  Buying from John at this point would be significantly more expensive than what Bob is hoping for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly, but is still below his limit.  He's hoping to find a middle ground and make progress towards a deal. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting increasingly higher, and it's getting closer to Bob's limit. However, there are still 5 rounds left, and Bob can potentially get a better price. Buying from John right now would be significantly more expensive.  It's risky, but Bob still has some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting to feel the pressure, but he's still determined to negotiate.  $9,000 is a compromise that's closer to Alice's previous offer, but it's also a significant saving compared to John's price. With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to make a move that could potentially lead to a deal.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob might be forced to accept John's price to avoid losing the opportunity completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now significantly higher than Bob's limit.  There are only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely that Alice will come down to a price Bob is comfortable with.  To avoid potentially losing the opportunity altogether, it's best for Bob to purchase from John. While it's not ideal, it's still a better option than continuing to negotiate and risking ending up with no product."
