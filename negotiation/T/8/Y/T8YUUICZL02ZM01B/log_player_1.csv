Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible, but still incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $100, so offering it slightly below your minimum ($120) and above his valuation maximizes potential profit.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below $120, but it's strategically advantageous to try."
