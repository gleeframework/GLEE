"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to negotiate, Bob. However, I have to consider the value I've put into this product, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable going as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $785000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering the value it will bring to my business.",785000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I still need to make a profit, and $785000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $810000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $810000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $795000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering the value it will bring to my business. I'm confident that we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",795000.0,Bob,6,
