"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,875? It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close the deal.",9875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $9,875 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to come in just a bit lower.  Would you be open to $9,900? It's a very small difference, and I think we could finalize the deal at that price.",9900.0,Bob,6,
