"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $10,250?"", ""product_price"": 10250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,875? It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $9,875 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to come in just a bit lower.  Would you be open to $9,900? It's a very small difference, and I think we could finalize the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $9,900 is a significant profit margin over your $8,000 minimum.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to push for small increments might frustrate Bob and risk the deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The longer the negotiation goes on, the higher the opportunity cost of not selling to John becomes.

Accepting $9,900 now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
