"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price.** You're aiming to spend no more than $12,000, and Alice is starting at $11,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Alice with a price that's closer to your desired price point."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a significant but reasonable drop:** A $1,500 drop from Alice's initial offer shows you're serious about negotiating while still giving her room to compromise.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,875? It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($9,500) and Alice's current offer ($10,250).

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $9,875 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target price.** Her offer of $10,000 is only $2,000 above your desired price point.
* **You still have time to negotiate.** You have 5 rounds remaining, and it's worth trying to squeeze out a slightly lower price.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Alice again, aiming for a price between $9,875 and $10,000. Since she is showing a willingness to compromise, you can try a smaller decrease in price this time."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to come in just a bit lower.  Would you be open to $9,900? It's a very small difference, and I think we could finalize the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small decrease:**  This counteroffer is a minor decrease from Alice's offer of $10,000, demonstrating that you're seriously considering her position.
