"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum value ($15,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without me feeling pressured to accept a drastically lower price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and focuses on the value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price with further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is too risky:**  While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, there's a chance I might be able to get a better deal with Bob, especially as I have 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $9,500 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes a ""good deal"" for both of us, highlighting the potential for a win-win situation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  This offer still gives me some room to negotiate further if necessary, but it shows I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short of my target. Can you meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and even below the previous counteroffer of $11,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are still 6 rounds left to negotiate. I believe I can get a higher price with further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is still risky:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, there's a good chance I can get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I don't want to prematurely sell to John and potentially miss out on a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $11,500?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm sticking to my strategy of moving towards Bob's offer but keeping a gap between my offer and his. This creates pressure for him to meet me halfway.
* **Framing for Compromise:** I emphasize ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to view the offer as a positive outcome for both of us.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I reiterate my confidence in the value proposition for Bob, reinforcing the idea that this deal would be beneficial for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable going above $10,500. I think we're getting close, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is still on my side:**  We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I still have the opportunity to get a better deal. 
* **Negotiating for a better price:**  I'm not satisfied with Bob's latest offer, as it's still below my minimum.  I need to keep pushing for a higher price.
* **Risk of selling to John is increasing:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is appealing, it's still risky as I might be able to negotiate a better price with Bob. However, I'm starting to consider this option more seriously since time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go below $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and we're both getting closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to a Firm Price:**  I'm holding firm on my previous offer of $11,000. I've made concessions, and it's time for Bob to make a significant move.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  The message focuses on the ""fairness"" of the price, emphasizing that it's reasonable and that a deal is within reach.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:**  The message remains positive and encourages Bob to reach an agreement. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 3 rounds remaining, the pressure is increasing. I need to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not willing to compromise too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit short. Can we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** Only two rounds remain.  I've already made significant concessions, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price.
* **Risk of Lower Price:** There's a high risk that Bob will continue to push for a lower price. 
* **Guaranteeing My Minimum:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value of $15,000.  It's a safer option than potentially getting a lower offer from Bob.  
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is barely above his original $9,500 offer. This suggests he's not willing to move much further, and further negotiation is unlikely to produce a higher price."
