,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe it's a bit overpriced, and I'd like to discuss further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to drop my price slightly, but I'm proposing $1,350,000.  This price still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the outcome. Let's work together to find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us.  However,  $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm proposing $1,340,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,320,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement. $1,320,000 is just not a price I can accept. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time, but I'm offering $1,330,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're serious about buying this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1330000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,315,000 for the product. I think this is the best we can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1315000.0,Bob,8,
