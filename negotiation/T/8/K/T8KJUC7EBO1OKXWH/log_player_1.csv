"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation in case he counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's perceived value, but closer to my minimum. I'm hoping he'll be willing to compromise and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum of $120, I've already gone through 4 rounds and Bob is getting closer to my asking price.  Accepting his offer is the best option at this point, as it's likely the best deal I'm going to get with Bob, and John's offer is only $10 more.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing both buyers with continued negotiation."
