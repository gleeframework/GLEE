"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $12,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $13,000.  This allows both of us to walk away with a fair deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, I still feel that we can find a price that suits both of us better. I would like to counter with an offer of $12,500 for your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This would be a great deal for both of us, and it's closer to the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
