{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already ahead.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It avoids immediate rejection:** By starting close to your target price, you minimize the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $12,000 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, you're in a strong position:

* **You know the product is worth more to Bob.**  He's already stated he values it at $15,000.
* **You have a backup buyer.**  John is willing to pay your minimum, giving you a safety net.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Show Bob you're serious about getting a better price.**
* **Potentially push Bob to increase his offer.** 
* **Maintain leverage in the negotiation.**

The next round, you'll have the opportunity to make a counteroffer that's more appealing to you than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $12,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $13,000.  This allows both of us to walk away with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Split the difference:** You're offering a compromise that's halfway between your last offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows you're willing to negotiate and come to a reasonable agreement.
* **Maintain leverage:** While you're lowering your price, you're not settling for Bob's initial low offer. You're still leaving room for him to potentially counteroffer again, but you're showing him that you're firm in your value.
* **Highlight the benefit to Bob:** You emphasize that the offer is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than the $15,000 he values the product at.

This counteroffer balances your desire to make a good profit with the potential to finalize the deal with Bob and avoid the uncertainty of going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, I still feel that we can find a price that suits both of us better. I would like to counter with an offer of $12,500 for your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price and the initial price you proposed.  There's still room for a better deal.

* **You have a backup buyer:**  Selling to John guarantees your minimum price, giving you a safety net.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** You know Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more.

By rejecting this offer, you:

* **Show Bob that you're not desperate for a sale.**  You're not willing to settle for the first offer that's close to your minimum.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  You can potentially increase the price by making a counteroffer.
* **Give yourself time to consider your options:**  You can carefully weigh the pros and cons of each potential outcome and make an informed decision.

You can now counteroffer with a price that's closer to your desired price, aiming for a compromise.  Remember, you have John as a backup option, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This would be a great deal for both of us, and it's closer to the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain leverage:**  This offer shows Bob that you're willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of your own financial goals. It keeps the pressure on him to increase his offer.
* **Focus on compromise:**  This is a smaller step than your last counteroffer, suggesting that you're actively searching for a compromise.
* **Emphasize a win-win situation:** You remind Bob that this price is still a great deal for him, highlighting the mutual benefit.

By choosing this counteroffer, you're trying to achieve a balance between getting a good price and concluding the negotiation with Bob.  This offer could be the final one before accepting John's offer, or it could lead to further negotiation with Bob. The key is to keep the leverage and try to close the deal as close to your desired price as possible."
