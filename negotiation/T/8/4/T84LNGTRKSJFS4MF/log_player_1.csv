"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down while still exceeding my minimum target of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $10,000 as I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,800 is getting close to my minimum, I still believe there's potential to get a higher price, especially since I'm approaching the halfway point in the negotiations. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $10,000 as I'm still aiming for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200} 
```

I'm making a smaller concession this time, moving closer to Bob's last offer but still holding out for a higher price. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,600 is only slightly below my minimum,  I'm not desperate. I'm still optimistic that I can get a higher price from Bob, especially since I'm nearing the end of the negotiations. I'm also willing to risk it since selling to John would be a guaranteed $10,000, which I still consider a good outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm offering my minimum price.  I'm confident that Bob will accept, as he's likely to prefer this to a guaranteed rejection in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting risky.  There are only two rounds left, and Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher.  While I'd like to get a better price, I'm not confident that I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John at $10,000 guarantees my minimum target and is the safest option."
