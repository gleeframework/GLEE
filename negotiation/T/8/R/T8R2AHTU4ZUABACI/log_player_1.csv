"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with a question to keep the communication open and invite Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** Bob's offer is still below my desired price of $1,500,000, and I believe there's potential to get closer to that by continuing negotiation.
* **Ten rounds remaining:** I still have plenty of rounds left to bargain with Bob, so it's worth trying to push for a higher price. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm not desperate yet and want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,400,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This would be a win-win for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price relatively high.
* **Reiterating the win-win:** I emphasize that this price benefits both of us. This appeals to Bob's sense of fairness and encourages him to see the value in the deal.
* **Staying open to discussion:**  I end with a question to keep the communication open and invite Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to suggest a price of $1,325,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a significant distance from my $1,500,000 target.
* **Time to negotiate:** I still have 6 rounds remaining and a good amount of leverage.  It's worth pushing for a higher price, especially since Bob seems willing to negotiate.
* **John's offer as a backup:**  John's offer provides a safety net if I can't get a better deal with Bob, but I don't want to settle for significantly less than that yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,362,500?  I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1362500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This reinforces my willingness to compromise and demonstrates a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Focus on fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I keep the message positive and encouraging, hoping to build rapport with Bob and maintain a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest proposal. I've considered your suggestion, and I would like to counter with a price of $1,340,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still close to my target:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still a significant distance from my $1,500,000 target, and I believe we can bridge that gap.
* **Time to leverage:** With only four rounds left, I need to use my remaining leverage to try to push for a higher price.  
* **John's offer as a safety net:** John's offer provides a fallback option, but I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than that yet. I want to see if I can secure a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,340,000 is still a little low for me. Let's try $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and we're getting very close to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm making a small concession by increasing my offer to $1,350,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Emphasizing progress:** I remind Bob that we're ""getting very close to a deal"" to build a sense of momentum and encourage him to accept.
* **Fairness and compromise:** I continue to emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed your proposal carefully and would like to counter with a price of $1,345,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,345,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,345,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are down to the last two rounds, and there's not much room for further negotiation. 
* **Small gap remaining:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, the difference of $55,000 is still substantial, and I don't have the time to try to close that gap.
* **John's offer is secure:** John's offer guarantees me my target price of $1,500,000. There's no risk involved in accepting it.

It's better to secure the guaranteed price with John than to risk losing out on a potentially better deal with Bob."
