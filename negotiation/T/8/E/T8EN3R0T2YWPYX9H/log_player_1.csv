Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  $14,000 is above your $12,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a $1,000 difference between your offer and Bob's perceived value, which provides space for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a strong opening:** This price demonstrates your confidence in the product's value while also inviting Bob to engage in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep the price closer to $12000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? I propose $13000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
