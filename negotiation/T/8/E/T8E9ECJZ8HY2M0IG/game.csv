"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be open to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $95. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $102. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",102.0,Alice,5,
