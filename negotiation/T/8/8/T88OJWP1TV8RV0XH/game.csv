"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! While it's a great product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $95? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about $105? It's a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit short on my original price. How about we go up to $115? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for this amazing product. Plus, I'm willing to throw in a special bonus for you if you agree to this price.",115.0,Alice,5,
