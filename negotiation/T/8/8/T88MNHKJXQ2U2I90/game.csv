"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'll pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $9,250 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's settle on $9,100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it will let us close this deal.",9100.0,Bob,6,
