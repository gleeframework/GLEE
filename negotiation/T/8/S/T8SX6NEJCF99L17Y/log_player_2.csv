"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going down to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  He should counteroffer again and try to negotiate a price closer to his target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than what John is offering. Bob has already made two counteroffers, and Alice is likely not going to budge much more.  It's time to cut his losses and go with the sure thing."
