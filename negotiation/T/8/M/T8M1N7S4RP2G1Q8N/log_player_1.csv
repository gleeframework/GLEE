{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation room while still giving me a profit of $150,000. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product.  I'll see if I can bridge the gap with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, however.  How about $900,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $875,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to justify selling the product to him. I value the product at $1,000,000, and I'm confident I can find another buyer who is willing to pay that amount. It's more important for me to ensure my minimum profit is met than to risk settling for less."
