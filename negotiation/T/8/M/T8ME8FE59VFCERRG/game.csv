"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product. This is a starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing further.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $6,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. This is a more reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a great price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value and my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.
