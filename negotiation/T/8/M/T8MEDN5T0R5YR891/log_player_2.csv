"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since the maximum you are willing to pay is $1,500,000, and John is offering the product for that exact price, there is no benefit to negotiating with Alice. Buying from John immediately saves you time and effort."
