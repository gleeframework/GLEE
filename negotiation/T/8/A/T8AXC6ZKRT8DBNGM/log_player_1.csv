Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without going over, as this maximizes our profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **John as a Backup:** We have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't go below $800,000.

This strategy aims to secure a significant profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
