"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,500 for the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,750 for the product.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. $8,750 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference, how about $8,875? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,
