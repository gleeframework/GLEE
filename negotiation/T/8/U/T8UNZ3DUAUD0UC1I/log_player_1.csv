"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe will be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point, so feel free to share any thoughts you might have."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer considerably above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation while establishing a firm position.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message aims to build rapport and emphasize the product's value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By inviting Bob's thoughts and explicitly mentioning finding a mutually agreeable price, I signal a willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy seeks to maximize my potential profit while leaving space for a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects my maximum budget and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While selling to John is tempting, I believe there's room for negotiation with Bob. It's early in the process, and I'm willing to engage in further rounds to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession from my initial offer to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reiterating the product's value to justify the high price while acknowledging Bob's offer with the phrase ""meet somewhere in the middle.""
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The $1,900,000 counteroffer is still comfortably above my minimum price, allowing for further negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,900,000 is closer to my budget, it's still beyond what I can currently afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000 for the product. This offer reflects a significant price reduction from your initial proposal and represents a fair compromise that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my absolute minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk he might walk away.  Accepting this offer guarantees I achieve my minimum target and avoids the potential loss of the deal."
