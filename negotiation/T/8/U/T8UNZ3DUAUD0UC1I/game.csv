"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe will be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point, so feel free to share any thoughts you might have.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects my maximum budget and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,900,000 is closer to my budget, it's still beyond what I can currently afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000 for the product. This offer reflects a significant price reduction from your initial proposal and represents a fair compromise that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
