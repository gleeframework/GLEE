"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  That's a significant reduction from my original offer and still gives you a great value."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $110, so how about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can get more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $108.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this and move on."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's a bit lower than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $80.  Also,  it seems like Bob is really committed to $107, and I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with John's lower offer."
