"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. This is a unique product, and I believe this price accurately reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this price is still fair considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I initially aimed higher, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,350,000? This recognizes the product's value while finding a compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'm proposing $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that this is your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
