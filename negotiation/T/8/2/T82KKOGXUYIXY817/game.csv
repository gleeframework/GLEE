,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still allows me to make a profit, while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
