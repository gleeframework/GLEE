"I appreciate your willingness to sell, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to me is $12,000.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  That's still a great price for you, given the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13,000 for the product. That's the most I'm willing to pay.",13000.0,Bob,4,
