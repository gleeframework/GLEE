"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to both of us to encourage Bob to see it as a good deal.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The price is high enough to potentially earn a good profit, but also leaves room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Avoiding John:** This offer is attractive enough to Bob that it's unlikely he'll immediately reject it, preventing me from having to resort to selling to John for the lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to sell, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to me is $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer. While it's still above his estimated value, it's not high enough for me to accept. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left, which gives me ample opportunity to counter and try to secure a better price.
* **Avoiding John:** I'm still aiming to maximize my profit and avoid selling to John at a lower price, especially since I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  That's still a great price for you, given the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my last offer and Bob's, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to reconsider.
* **Maintaining Margin:**  This price is still above my minimum threshold, allowing me to make a profit while staying open to negotiation.
* **Remaining Optimistic:** I'm expressing confidence in finding a mutually agreeable price, hoping to avoid further rounds and sell before resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13,000 for the product. That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum goal of $15,000. While it's not ideal, it's a good compromise.
* **Limited Time:** We're already on Round 4, and with each round, the risk of having to sell to John increases.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:**  While $13,000 is close to my minimum, there's still room for counteroffers in the remaining rounds if I choose to reject this offer. However, the risk of reaching the final round and having to accept John's offer is too high.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing out on a better deal in the later rounds."
