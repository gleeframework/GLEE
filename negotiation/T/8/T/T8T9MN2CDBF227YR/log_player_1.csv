This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1,100,000. This is the maximum I can afford at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,150,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose an offer of $1,125,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,125,000, but I'm still a little short of my goal.  Would you consider $1,140,000? This is a compromise that allows us both to move forward.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1140000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Alice. I am willing to offer $1,135,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still being within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,135,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,135,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob won't meet my minimum requirements. It's time to move on and sell the product to John, who is willing to pay my desired price."
