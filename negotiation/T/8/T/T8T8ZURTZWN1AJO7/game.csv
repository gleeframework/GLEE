"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $1,000,000.  This would allow me to make a good profit while giving you a fair price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This price reflects the product's true value and provides a substantial profit for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a more agreeable price. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to proceed with the purchase and giving you a solid return on the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
