Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $9,500. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a substantial discount from my ""walk-away"" price but still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By offering a ""discount,"" I subtly imply there might be other interested buyers, encouraging a quicker decision from Bob."
