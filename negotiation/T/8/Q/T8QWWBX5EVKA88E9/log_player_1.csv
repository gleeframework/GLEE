Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob recognizes the product's value to him ($1,000,000). He saves $400,000 compared to your backup offer, and you make a significant profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob counters with a lower price. You can then decide whether to meet him somewhere in the middle or proceed with selling to John."
