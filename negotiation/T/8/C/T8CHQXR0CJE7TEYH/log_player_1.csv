Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay significantly more than your minimum price. Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and ""limited-time,"" you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, making it more likely he'll engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while keeping your fallback option (selling to John) secure."
