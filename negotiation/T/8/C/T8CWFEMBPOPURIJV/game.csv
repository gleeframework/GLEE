"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me at the moment. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than $600,000.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what you're getting.  What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still too far out for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.  Let me know if this works for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large.  I'm willing to consider $1,700,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end.  Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but that price is still beyond my budget.  I can go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.  Please let me know your decision.",800000.0,Bob,6,
