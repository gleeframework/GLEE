"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay as little as possible, so we start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship, but firm in stating our target price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give us a good idea of how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's still a good price for you, and I can make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a price we might accept, we're still aiming lower. We'll reject this offer and propose something closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're showing willingness to negotiate by increasing our offer, but only slightly. This keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to our desired price.
* **Justification:** We're framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Alice to see it favorably.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're aiming for a price around $75, leaving some room for a potential final negotiation if Alice counters again."
