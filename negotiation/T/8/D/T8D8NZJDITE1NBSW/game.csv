"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $10,000? That's my absolute top end. ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm very keen on this product, and I think $11,000 would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
