"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $14,000 is above his budget and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a better price with Alice before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $10,000.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice since he has a better option."
