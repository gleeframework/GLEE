"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer that's favorable to you. This leaves room for concessions and creates the perception that you're aiming high.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $1,100,000, I'm leaving a significant margin between my asking price and both Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and John's offer ($800,000).
* **Confidence:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is a rational negotiator. If I knew Bob was highly aggressive or easily offended, I might adjust my approach.
* **Information Advantage:**  I have more information than Bob about my minimum acceptable price. I need to use this to my advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both my initial offer and Bob's perceived value of the product. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of undervaluing what I'm selling. 

**Strategy for Next Round:**

In the next round, I will propose a counteroffer closer to $1,000,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to meet Bob somewhere in the middle while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement that benefits us both."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By decreasing my asking price by $75,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Holding Ground:**  However, the counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's initial offer, emphasizing that I'm not willing to settle for a price far below my target.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value. I would like to counter with a price of $975,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but only by $25,000. This suggests he has more room to move, and I'm willing to bet he values the product closer to my initial assessment.  I need to hold firm to secure a price that reflects the product's true worth.

**Strategy for Next Round:**

My next counteroffer will be a smaller concession, aiming for around $1,010,000. This signals that while I'm open to negotiation, I'm also serious about securing a fair price. I'll emphasize the value Bob gains from the deal to incentivize him to meet me closer to my number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I've considered your latest offer carefully. To be candid, while $975,000 is a respectable sum, it doesn't fully reflect the potential this product holds for your business. I'm confident it's worth significantly more to you in the long run. I'm willing to agree on a price of $1,010,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I've reduced my counteroffer by $15,000, signaling that I'm nearing my bottom line.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm adding a level of urgency and encouraging Bob to take this offer seriously. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value *to Bob's specific business*, aiming to reframe his thinking beyond just the immediate price tag.

**Next Steps:**

This is a pivotal moment in the negotiation. Bob's response will reveal how much he truly values the product and how flexible he's willing to be. If he doesn't accept this offer, I may need to seriously consider John's offer to avoid the risk of a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with a price of $990,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1 million, Bob's offer of $990,000 is strong. Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Strong Return:**  $990,000 is a significant profit, well above my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Prolonged negotiations can lead to frustration and potentially stalemate.  It's often better to secure a good deal than risk losing it entirely.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate means I might miss out on other opportunities while this deal remains uncertain.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a very favorable outcome and avoid potential downsides of dragging out the process."
