"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $850,000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,000,000. This price still allows for a significant return on your investment and reflects the value I believe this product holds. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
