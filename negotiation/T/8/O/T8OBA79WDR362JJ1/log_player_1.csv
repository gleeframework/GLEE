Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for your product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still above my budget.
