"Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product for a price of $1500000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I'm confident it will be incredibly valuable to you.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for your product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $800000 is simply too low for this product. Considering its unique potential, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still above my budget. Given the value I see in the product and my financial constraints, I'm prepared to offer $950000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our positions and allows for a successful transaction. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $950000 is still not enough for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm committed to making this deal work, but $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000 for your product.  This is the absolute maximum I can offer while staying within my financial constraints. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.  If we can reach an agreement at this price, we can both move forward.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $1050000 is almost there, but I need to be at $1075000 to make this worthwhile for me. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a price that benefits us both. If you're truly interested in this product, let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
