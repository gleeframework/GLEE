"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire the product for a bit less. Given its value to me and your asking price, I'd like to offer $1,050,000.  This price is still within a profitable range for you, and it allows me to secure the product within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm confident in the value this product brings, and I'm aiming for a price that reflects its potential. Would you consider $1,120,000?  It's a strong offer that allows me to make a fair deal while acknowledging your interest.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand you believe in the product's value, $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
