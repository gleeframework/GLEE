"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the return you stand to gain."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the ""fairness"" of the price to anchor Bob's perception.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, we gather information about Bob's willingness to pay and set the stage for subsequent offers and counteroffers. 

We have a $150,000 buffer from John's offer, allowing us to negotiate strategically without risking a no-deal situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire the product for a bit less. Given its value to me and your asking price, I'd like to offer $1,050,000.  This price is still within a profitable range for you, and it allows me to secure the product within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is tempting, we're still early in the negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Test Bob's resolve:**  We need to gauge how flexible Bob is on price. 
* **Maintain a strong position:** Accepting too early might signal that we're willing to settle for less.

We have ample room to negotiate between Bob's offer and our guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm confident in the value this product brings, and I'm aiming for a price that reflects its potential. Would you consider $1,120,000?  It's a strong offer that allows me to make a fair deal while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer with a $30,000 decrease, demonstrating flexibility but also holding firm on a price above our guaranteed sale.
* **Positive Framing:** We're emphasizing a ""fair deal"" and acknowledging Bob's interest to maintain a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:**  This counteroffer gives Bob room to counter again while keeping us well within a profitable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand you believe in the product's value, $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 represents a solid profit of $100,000 above our guaranteed sale to John. Here's why accepting now makes sense:

* **Strong Profit Margin:** $100,000 is a significant gain, and holding out for more risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's willingness to meet halfway shows he's motivated to buy.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the earnings sooner. 

While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, the risk likely outweighs the potential reward at this point."
