"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This represents a significant discount compared to what you could gain from it, while still providing me with fair compensation for something I value highly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. It's likely she'll return with a lower price, especially since she knows you have John as a backup option."
