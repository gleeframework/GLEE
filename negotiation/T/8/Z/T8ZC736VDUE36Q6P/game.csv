"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
