"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to show I'm willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer and it still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to go up to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, I'm getting closer to the price point where it might become too risky to continue negotiating. $9,200 is a good price for the product and is better than the $8,000 I would get from John."
