"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation and signal that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Strategic Number:** $10,500 is a less common, specific number. This can sometimes make the offer feel more considered and potentially give a psychological edge in negotiations.
* **Polite and Open:** The message maintains a positive and respectful tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
