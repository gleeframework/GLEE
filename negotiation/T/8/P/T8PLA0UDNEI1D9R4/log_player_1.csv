""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers.  While I have a standing offer for $1,500,000, I believe in giving valued contacts a first look. I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below John's offer. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring we don't leave too much money on the table.
* **Justification and Urgency:** Highlighting the standing offer and presenting it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" creates a sense of urgency and justifies the high initial price.
* **Open for negotiation:**  The tone suggests  willingness to negotiate,  encouraging Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere closer to his perceived value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits.
* It's crucial to gauge Bob's reactions and be prepared to adjust the price slightly if needed. 
* It's always better to secure a deal with Bob, even at a slightly lower price, than to risk delays or complications with the guaranteed sale to John."
