"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers.  While I have a standing offer for $1,500,000, I believe in giving valued contacts a first look. I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than her initial asking price, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  There's no need to settle for a higher price."
