{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in great condition and worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to get close to my desired value while leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I need to get closer to my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good deal considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground.  $140 is closer to my minimum and hopefully still attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I'd prefer to sell to him if I could get a better price, I'm not willing to go lower than $150. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
