"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe the product is a good fit for me, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1250000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your position on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings to both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to make one final push on the price. How about $1,275,000? This is my best and final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options, though I believe this product has the potential to be highly beneficial for you.",1275000.0,Alice,5,,
