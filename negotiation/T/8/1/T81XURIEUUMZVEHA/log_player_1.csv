Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $150 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also establishes a perceived higher value for the product.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose anything because I can still sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
