Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point, as it is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation. 
* It's important to remember that Alice is willing to sell for $80, so this offer is within her acceptable range."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price point.
* Offering $95 shows that Bob is willing to negotiate and is serious about buying the product.
* It also leaves room for Alice to potentially counteroffer at $98 or $97, which would still be a better deal for Bob than $105 or $120.
* With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to start closing the gap to avoid having to buy from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is still too high, but it is getting closer to Bob's limit.
* There are still 3 rounds left, which means there's time to see if Bob can get a better price. 
* Bob is likely to have to pay a bit more than he initially hoped, but buying from John for $120 is still worse than accepting Alice's offer. 
* Continuing to negotiate could result in a final price between $105 and $110, which would be a better deal for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* With only two rounds remaining, Bob needs to make a more significant concession to avoid being forced to buy from John.
* Offering $105 is a compromise between Bob's previous offer of $95 and Alice's current offer of $110.
* This demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to meet Alice halfway.
* If Alice rejects this offer, Bob may be forced to accept her next offer or buy from John, as he has only one round left."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This is the final round of negotiations.

* Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to ensure Bob gets the product without exceeding his budget."
