Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,250 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,400. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price of $10,000.  I'm not sure how much more she's willing to budge, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target before buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,400 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,100 for the product. If we can agree on this price, we can close the deal and avoid any further negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,100 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,200. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,200 is still $200 over my ideal price. While we've come close to a deal, there's a risk that we'll continue to haggle back and forth and waste more time. Since I have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes sense to take the sure thing and secure the product at my target price."
