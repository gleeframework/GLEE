"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $10,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $12,000, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250. This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to still make a decent profit while I get the product within my budget.  What do you say?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,250 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,400. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12,000.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,400 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,100 for the product. If we can agree on this price, we can close the deal and avoid any further negotiation.  What do you think?",10100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,100 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,200. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12,000.",10200.0,Alice,7,
