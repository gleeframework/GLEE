"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth in the current market.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be able to fit it into my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
