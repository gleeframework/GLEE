"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully developed and it's worth at least $8,000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it can bring. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
