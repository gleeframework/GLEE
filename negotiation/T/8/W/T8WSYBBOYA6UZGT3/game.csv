"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $9,000 isn't quite meeting my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a reasonable offer for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I hope we can finalize a deal at this point. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,750 for the product.  This price represents a fair compromise and moves us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're getting closer, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. ",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. Given our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This price represents a fair compromise and gets us close to a final agreement. Let's finalize this deal!",10000.0,Bob,8,
