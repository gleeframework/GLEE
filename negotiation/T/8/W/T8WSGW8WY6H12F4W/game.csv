"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as high as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value to me. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to be mindful of my minimum requirements.",9200.0,Alice,5,
