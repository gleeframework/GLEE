"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really committed to buying this product, and I'm wondering if we could find a compromise at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'm offering the product to you for $11,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
