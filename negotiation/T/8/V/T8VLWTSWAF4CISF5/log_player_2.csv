"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's still good for him, but also shows he's serious about buying.  $105 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This counteroffer also gives Bob a chance to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is now closer to Bob's ideal price point. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price within his budget, and prevents the risk of losing the deal."
