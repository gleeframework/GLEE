"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
