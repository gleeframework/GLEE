"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on this valuable product, and I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is a decent offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice is still making a significant profit over her valuation. By rejecting this offer, I might be able to get Alice to lower her price further, getting closer to her $800,000 value."
