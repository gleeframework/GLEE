"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's meet halfway on this, and we can close the deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,000. Can you consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my offer.  However,  $11,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $11,250 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both walk away satisfied.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,100 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  To make this deal work, I need to be at $11,150. This is a small increase, and I believe it represents a fair compromise that will allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",11150.0,Alice,7,
