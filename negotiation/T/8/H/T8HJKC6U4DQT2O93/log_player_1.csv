Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open Ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first step in the negotiation. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and my understanding of his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I could sell to John for $120, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Next round counteroffer:** I'll use the next round to counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This would still give me a good price, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle ground:**  $100 is halfway between my minimum ($120) and Bob's offer ($80). This shows a commitment to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting the ""value of the product"" reinforces its worth and potentially justifies the price.
* **Open ended question:**  Again, asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
