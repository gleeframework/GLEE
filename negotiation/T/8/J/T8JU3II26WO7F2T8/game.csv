,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  Let's make a deal!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $107.50 is still a bit lower than I'd like. Let's try $109. That's closer to my price, but still a good value for you.",109.0,Alice,5,
