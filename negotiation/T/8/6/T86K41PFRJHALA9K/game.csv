"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value this product brings to my business. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
