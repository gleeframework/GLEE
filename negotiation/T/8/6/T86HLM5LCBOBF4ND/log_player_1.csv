Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a price of $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of his budget and is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $875,000 is a significant profit above my minimum and a good compromise."
