"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me and allowing for a reasonable profit for you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $1,100,000 and my valuation of the product is substantial. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This takes into account its true worth and leaves us both with a reasonable outcome.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a valuation for the product, but $1,300,000 is still out of my price range.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,200,000. This reflects a significant commitment from my end, and I believe it's a fair offer given both our respective valuations. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
