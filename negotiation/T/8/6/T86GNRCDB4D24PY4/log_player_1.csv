"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that you place high value on the product.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,400,000, we anchor the negotiation closer to our desired outcome. Even if Bob rejects the offer, his counter-offers might still be closer to $1,200,000 than if we started lower.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit, we also need to be aware of John's standing offer.  If negotiations with Bob stall significantly, we have a good alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me and allowing for a reasonable profit for you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. We have room to negotiate, and John's offer provides a safety net if we can't reach a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $1,100,000 and my valuation of the product is substantial. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This takes into account its true worth and leaves us both with a reasonable outcome."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We reduced our price by $100,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still staying above our minimum.
* **Holding Firm:** While the concession is significant, we're not drastically dropping the price. We want to signal that the product's value is non-negotiable to a certain extent. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We still have the option to sell to John, and we want Bob to be aware that we're not desperate to make a deal at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a valuation for the product, but $1,300,000 is still out of my price range.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,200,000. This reflects a significant commitment from my end, and I believe it's a fair offer given both our respective valuations. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. There's no strategic advantage to rejecting this offer, as we can achieve the same result by selling to John. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to an impasse."
