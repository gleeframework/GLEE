"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still above your ideal price range.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, you open the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Buying from John is not the best option yet.** While John offers a guaranteed price, it's significantly higher than your desired price range. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  A $750,000 offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial $900,000, demonstrating your desire to save money.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer still allows for a potential compromise, as it's above Alice's minimum value of $800,000.
* **Avoids immediate escalation:** Starting with a large jump might risk Alice walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $850,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and a significant improvement from her initial offer.
* **Further negotiation is risky.** While you could try for a lower price, there's a risk Alice will reject and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Accepting secures a good deal.** This offer provides a good balance between saving money and ensuring you get the product."
