Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I believe this gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good profit. 

By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer. If he seems unwilling to negotiate, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe I can still get a better price from him.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm offering $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for profit. By coming down slightly, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.  This counteroffer should hopefully push Bob to reconsider his initial offer and come up slightly to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is significantly closer to my desired price. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial offer,  I believe this is a good compromise. It's a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob or having to sell to John at my minimum."
