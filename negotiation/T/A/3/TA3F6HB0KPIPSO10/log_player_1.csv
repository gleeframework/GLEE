Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at that price, there's no incentive to go lower.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product to justify the high price to Bob."
