"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
