Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to meet you at a price that's closer to what you're comfortable with.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground. I'm willing to make one last offer at $1,000,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
 
This is a strategic move.  We are getting close to Alice's value and giving a final offer. This puts the pressure on Alice, while still leaving us room to go to John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your last offer, but I'm not willing to sell at $1,000,000. I think you know the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to make one last offer to you, and I'll meet you at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

It's clear Alice is not going to budge below $1,100,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get her below this price in just one round.  Buying from John at $1,500,000, while not ideal, is still within our budget and ensures we get the product. It's better to secure the product at this point than risk not getting it at all."
