"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price is still fair considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. I believe this compromise allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This price is fair considering the product's value, and it's closer to what I can comfortably afford.  Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
