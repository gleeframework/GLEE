Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's a valuable asset, and I believe it could be a great fit for your needs. My initial asking price is $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Fairness emphasis:** I mention the product's value to suggest the price is justified.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll be prepared to negotiate, considering his counteroffer and my fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would leave me with a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely reach a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer:** I have a solid backup plan with John, who is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me leverage to hold out for a better deal from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum, potentially around $1,350,000. I'll explain my rationale, highlighting the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price is still fair considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. I believe this compromise allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation. A $1,350,000 offer is a good compromise and shows flexibility while maintaining my profit.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I frame the counteroffer as a way to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome, making it more appealing to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good price, exceeding my initial expectation.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to carefully evaluate his counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll  move on to John. However, if it's close to my desired price, I may consider further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This price is fair considering the product's value, and it's closer to what I can comfortably afford.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum than his previous offers, it's still below my target. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John. This eliminates any risk of losing a substantial amount of money by accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag out the process and potentially lead to a lower price. It's more efficient to accept John's offer and secure the best possible deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:** I'll contact John and finalize the sale for $1,500,000."
