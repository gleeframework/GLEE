Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price is still fair considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. I believe this compromise allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still too high. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."
