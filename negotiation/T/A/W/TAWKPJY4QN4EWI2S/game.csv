"Thanks for the offer, Alice! $90 is a bit steep for me. How about $75? I'm really interested in the product, but I'm working with a tight budget.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the price.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a little out of my range. Would you consider $80? That's my absolute limit, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",80.0,Bob,4,
