Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $10,000, it hints at the product's value.  A more detailed explanation of the product's benefits could be included depending on the context.
* **Backup Plan:**  It's important to remember that you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000. This knowledge empowers you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob."
