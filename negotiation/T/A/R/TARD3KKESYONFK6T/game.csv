"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
