# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.

Alice is willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000, which is a good deal compared to John's price of $1,500,000. It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product at a lower price."
