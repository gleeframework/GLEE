"I appreciate your time and effort in considering my purchase. However, I believe the product's value is not worth $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than that in the current market. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
