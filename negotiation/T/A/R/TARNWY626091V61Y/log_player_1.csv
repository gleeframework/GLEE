"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it to be of significant value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting with a price of $10,000 gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets the tone for a good negotiation and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Leaving Room:** I haven't gone all the way up to the maximum price I'd like to get, leaving room to increase the offer if Bob seems interested.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  While I want to get the best price, I'm also aware that John's $8,000 offer is a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $8000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No room for improvement:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. Bob has shown he's not willing to pay more.
* **John's offer is the same:**  John is also offering $8,000.  
* **Time is valuable:**  Negotiating further could take up more rounds and risk losing the deal entirely.

In this scenario, accepting Bob's offer is the best way to ensure I get my minimum value for the product without risking further delay or a worse outcome."
