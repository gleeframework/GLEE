"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to me than that. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1250000.  This price is fair for both of us, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1350000?  That's a fair compromise, considering the value of this product to both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1350000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to pay $1300000. This price is within my budget and would allow us both to finalize this deal without either of us feeling like we've made a significant sacrifice.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this deal done, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hesitant about $1300000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1325000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1325000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm feeling generous. I'll go up to $1310000. This is the very best I can do while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.  Let's seal the deal at this price.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
