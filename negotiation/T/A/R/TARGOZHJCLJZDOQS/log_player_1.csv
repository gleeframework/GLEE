"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to me than that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1250000.  This price is fair for both of us, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I have 8 rounds left and the option to sell to John, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer. I'll try to counter Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,350,000?  That's a fair compromise, considering the value of this product to both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1350000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to pay $1300000. This price is within my budget and would allow us both to finalize this deal without either of us feeling like we've made a significant sacrifice. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I have 6 rounds left and the option to sell to John, so I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counter Bob again, trying to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this deal done, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hesitant about $1,300,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1325000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm feeling generous. I'll go up to $1310000. This is the very best I can do while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.  Let's seal the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,310,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've already made several concessions and Bob is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  We have only 4 rounds left, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation isn't going anywhere.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing - selling to John.  This will guarantee me the full value of the product and save me further negotiation headaches."
