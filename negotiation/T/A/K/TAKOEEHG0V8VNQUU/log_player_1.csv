Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can secure a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,000 difference gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage rather than immediately rejecting the offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me a clear floor price and helps me hold firm during negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate indicates that we can likely find a middle ground.
* **Maintaining Value:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before selling to John for a lower amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a good compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $9,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, so I'm not losing out on significant value.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not going to go much lower than this. If Bob doesn't accept, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $9,000 is only $1,000 below my ideal price and very close to my previous counteroffer.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'd be forced to sell to John for $10,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation might take more time and effort, and it's not guaranteed to result in a better outcome. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at $9,000 is the most rational decision in this situation."
