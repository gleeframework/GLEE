"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Leaving Room:** The offer is $50,000 below Bob's valuation, giving him an incentive to accept while acknowledging the product's worth to him.
* **Alternative:** I'm aware of John's offer, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob in these 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and accepting it would mean losing out on a substantial profit. While his counter was aggressive, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 

```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we consider $1,075,000?"",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving to $1,075,000, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""true worth and potential"" reinforces its value and provides a reason for my counteroffer. 
* **Time Constraint:** As we progress through the rounds, I need to balance getting closer to an agreement with Bob and the security of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I recognize its value,  $1,075,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $975,000? This offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob is inching upwards, but we're still a ways away from a desirable outcome.  It's time to leverage John's offer to nudge Bob closer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've received another offer for the product at a price very close to what you're proposing. However, I believe in being straightforward and transparent with you. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000 â€“ that's my final offer. It's a significantly discounted price considering the value you'll gain, and I need a decision now."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** By introducing the presence of another offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and competition for Bob.
* **Finality:**  Labeling it as my ""final offer"" signals that I'm serious and unlikely to negotiate further down. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""significantly discounted price"" and the value proposition aims to sway Bob towards accepting.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only five rounds remaining, I need Bob to understand that time is running out for him to secure the product."
