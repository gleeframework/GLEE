"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we consider $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I recognize its value,  $1,075,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $975,000? This offer represents a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I've received another offer for the product at a price very close to what you're proposing. However, I believe in being straightforward and transparent with you. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000 â€“ that's my final offer. It's a significantly discounted price considering the value you'll gain, and I need a decision now.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
