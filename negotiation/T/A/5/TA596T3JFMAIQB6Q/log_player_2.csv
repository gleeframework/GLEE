"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present our premier product, which I believe holds immense value for you, just like it does for me. This extraordinary item is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I am extending this opportunity to acquire it at a special introductory price of $950,000.

This offer represents an exceptional chance to secure a high-quality asset at a discount. Please consider this proposal carefully, as it may not be available at such favorable terms for long.

Should you decide to proceed, please let me know, and we can arrange for the transaction immediately. If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
Alice

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and buying from John would cost you the full $1,000,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves you money."
