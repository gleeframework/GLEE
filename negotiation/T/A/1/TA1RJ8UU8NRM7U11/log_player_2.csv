"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for this product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me."", 
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Significantly Below Their Ask:** By offering $600,000 against their $1,800,000, we signal that we're serious but find their initial price unrealistic. 
* **Not Insultingly Low:** While low, $600,000 isn't so low as to offend Alice and completely derail the negotiation. It leaves room for her to counter.
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the safety net of John's offer at $800,000 if Alice completely rejects our approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a generous offer considering its potential value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down from her initial offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than both our target price ($800,000) and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move her price suggests there's room for further negotiation. We need to show we're also willing to negotiate but won't accept an unreasonable price.
* **Next Offer Strategy:** We'll need to increase our offer in the next round, but we should do so gradually to continue pushing the price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while recognizing its fair value."", 
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're raising our offer by $100,000, showing Alice that we're willing to move towards her price but at a measured pace. 
* **Justification:** By saying it's ""outside my budget"" we're subtly reinforcing the idea that there's a limit to what we can afford.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This keeps us in the negotiation while putting pressure on Alice to significantly lower her asking price if she wants to make a deal. 
* **John as Backup:** It's important to remember that we can always walk away and buy from John if Alice remains unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm willing to make a further compromise and lower the price to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by declaring this her ""final offer"" to try and pressure you. Don't let it sway you too much; she might be willing to negotiate further.
* **Still Too High:**  $1,300,000 is still significantly above your target and John's offer. While she's coming down, it's not enough.
* **Time to Push Back:**  You've been incrementally increasing your offer, but Alice's concessions have been smaller.  You need to signal that her price needs to come down more substantially. 
* **Consider John:** With the gap still large and half the rounds gone, the option of buying from John is becoming increasingly attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but to be completely honest, $1,300,000 is just not feasible for me. If you're truly serious about selling, I could go as high as $800,000. However, I need you to understand that this is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  It's a fair offer given the market and the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** The time for incremental increases is over. We're now at the point where we need to be direct with Alice about our limit.
* **Justification:**  By saying ""not feasible"" and ""absolute maximum,"" we're emphasizing that this isn't a negotiation tactic â€“ it's a real budget constraint.
* **Matching John's Offer:** By offering our maximum of $800,000, we're essentially making our decision for Alice. She can either accept our offer or risk losing the sale.
* **Slight Psychological Edge:** While we're matching John's offer, we're framing it as our ""maximum"" to subtly suggest there's no more room for negotiation, even though there technically is. 

**Important Note:** At this point, we've reached our walk-away price. If Alice rejects this offer, we should strongly consider buying from John to avoid the risk of a stalemate or a higher price in the remaining rounds."
