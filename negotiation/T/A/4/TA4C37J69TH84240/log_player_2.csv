(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less from John.  There's no need to risk losing the chance to buy from John by accepting a price higher than you're willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's still worth holding out for a better price. You can get the product for cheaper from John, so rejecting this offer and continuing negotiations is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

You are willing to pay $800,000 for the product, so $850,000 is a reasonable counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

``` 

It's still worth holding out for a better price. You can get the product for cheaper from John, so rejecting this offer and continuing negotiations is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

You're getting closer to your target price, so a counteroffer of $875,000 is a good next step.  This shows you are serious about buying but still want a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is not budging from her price, and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  You've already come close to your limit, and John is offering the product for your maximum price. It's time to stop negotiating with Alice and go with the secure option of buying from John."
