"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $885,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product.",885000.0,Alice,5,
