"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am interested in purchasing the product for $125. Please let me know if this is possible.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our previous offers. I hope this proposal works for you.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to find common ground here.  I'm willing to go down to $140, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll be selling to John for $150.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $140 is still slightly higher than what I am comfortable paying. I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations.",130.0,Bob,6,
