"That's a great price, but unfortunately, it's a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 right now. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $10000, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm really hoping to make this work, but I can only go up to $9000. If that's not acceptable, I might have to look elsewhere.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $9500, and that's the lowest I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $9250. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go above $9500. I can meet you halfway between $9250 and $9500, so I'm willing to do $9375. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9375.0,Alice,7,
