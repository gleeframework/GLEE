Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I'm confident in its desirability."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal.""
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning a limited-time offer and another potential buyer, you create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Justifying the Price:** While you don't want to reveal your minimum price, vaguely mentioning the product's value helps justify the asking price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Great! You've secured a price higher than your minimum and even higher than John's offer.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have room to negotiate down towards $15,000, still ensuring a profit.
* **Bob rejects:** You can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. 

Remember, negotiation is about finding a mutually beneficial agreement. While you want the best price, you also want to make a deal!"
