"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  This price still gives you a significant advantage over your initial assessment, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value it brings to your business. Let's reach a deal before we run out of time.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not at a comfortable price. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,025,000. Can we discuss further?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,040,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to reach a more agreeable price point. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1040000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,040,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,020,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",1020000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,020,000 is still a bit short of my target.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,030,000. We've come a long way, and this final compromise will ensure a successful deal for both of us.  Let's close this out and move forward.",1030000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,030,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,015,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1015000.0,Bob,10,
