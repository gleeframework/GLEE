{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so he might be willing to pay a little more.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to sell for at least $120, so you have room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob counters, you can adjust your price up or down depending on his counteroffer and your desire to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product and think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still far below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price, or at least see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident this is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  That would be a fair price for both of us and a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  You have a guaranteed $120 with John, so it makes sense to keep negotiating with Bob to see if you can get closer to that number or even push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $92.50, which is a fair compromise considering we're both looking for a good deal.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
