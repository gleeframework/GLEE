"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product and think this is a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident this is still a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  That would be a fair price for both of us and a good deal for me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $92.50, which is a fair compromise considering we're both looking for a good deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",92.5,Alice,5,
