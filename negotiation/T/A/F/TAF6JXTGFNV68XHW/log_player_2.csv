"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price.  You can still get the product for cheaper from John, so there's no risk in negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product and think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident this is still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you can get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  That would be a fair price for both of us and a good deal for me."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $92.50, which is a fair compromise considering we're both looking for a good deal.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $92.5 is tempting, it's still more than you can get from John. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
