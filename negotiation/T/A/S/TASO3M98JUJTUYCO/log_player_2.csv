"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to benefit from its high-quality features. I am offering it to you for $110. This is a special introductory price, and I hope you'll find it attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my maximum price, but I can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still a reasonable price for both of us. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $107 for the product. This price still offers you a good deal while allowing me to maintain a reasonable margin. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, I can still try to push for a lower price. I have 7 rounds remaining and still have the option to buy from John. I'll try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $107 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to go up to $106. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 106}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm only going up by $1, but this shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to compromise.  It also leaves room for her to come down just a bit if she wants to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to lower my price to $106.50. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin, while providing you with a fair deal. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $0.50 higher than my last counteroffer. I've already made it clear I'm willing to pay $106, so accepting this offer is a good deal. It saves me $13.50 compared to buying from John, and I still have 5 rounds left in case I need to make another deal later."
