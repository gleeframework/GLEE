"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $107 for the product. This price still offers you a good deal while allowing me to maintain a reasonable margin. I hope this proposal works for you.",107.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $107 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to go up to $106. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to lower my price to $106.50. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin, while providing you with a fair deal. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",106.5,Alice,5,
