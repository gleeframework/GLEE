{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

This offer starts with a high price, allowing room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product to you, making it seem like a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than $10,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $13000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a great deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $13,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my target.  It's also better than selling to John for $10,000."
