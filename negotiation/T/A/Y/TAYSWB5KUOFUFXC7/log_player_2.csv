"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which is valued at $15,000 by you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I'm offering it to you for a special introductory price of $12,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to own a product that truly exceeds your expectations. Please let me know if you're interested in securing this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. You know it's only worth $15,000 to you, max.
* While $12,000 is less than $15,000, there's a good chance you can get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can consider John's offer."
