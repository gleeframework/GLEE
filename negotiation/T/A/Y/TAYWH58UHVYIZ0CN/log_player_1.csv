Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" Alice provides a soft justification for the high price without revealing her own minimum.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone remains open and invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the lines of communication open.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net at $1,200,000, Alice's goal is to maximize profit. Aiming higher with Bob first is a strategic move."
