"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm starting with a price of $100, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get more than $80, it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. Bob's offer is a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for the same price.  I want to avoid further negotiation rounds, especially as I have a chance to earn my minimum with this offer."
