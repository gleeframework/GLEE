"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than what John is offering. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can proceed to buy from John at a lower price, saving $350,000."
