"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $750,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still a bit far apart. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're not quite ready to accept $800,000 yet. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $815,000. This is the lowest price we're willing to accept, and we believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",815000.0,Alice,5,
