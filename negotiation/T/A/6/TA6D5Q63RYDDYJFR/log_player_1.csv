Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential"" you subtly reinforce that the product is worth a significant amount.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John. If he counters, you know he's seriously interested."
