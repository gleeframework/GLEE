"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than $1,100,000. How about we aim for $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you consider $1,220,000?",1220000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $1,220,000, but I still think I can do a bit better. How about we aim for $1,280,000? It's a fair compromise that gets me closer to my target price.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
