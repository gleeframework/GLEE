"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's still a good value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is closer to your offer and allows me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
