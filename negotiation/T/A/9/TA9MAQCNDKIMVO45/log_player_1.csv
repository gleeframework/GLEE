I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $10,000 to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a little more to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is still a reasonable price, considering the value of the product and my desire to make a profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to come up a bit."
