"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe will be a significant benefit to your operations. I'm confident the product's worth to you is substantial, and I'm prepared to offer it at a price that reflects its value. Please consider my offer of $950,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing you to secure a valuable asset while ensuring I receive a favorable return. Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is too high. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, which is your maximum limit. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with her or proceeding to buy from John."
