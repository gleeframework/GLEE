Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is within my budget, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a way to make this deal work.
