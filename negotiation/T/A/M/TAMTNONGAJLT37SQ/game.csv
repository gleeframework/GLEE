"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth a significant investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is within my budget, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, I know the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept anything below $1,100,000.  This is a very fair offer considering its potential value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
