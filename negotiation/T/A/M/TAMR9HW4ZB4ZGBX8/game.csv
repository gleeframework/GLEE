"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you given the value you place on the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both place on this product. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $900,000. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",950000.0,Alice,5,
