"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Since Bob's maximum is $120, it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is my initial asking price, I could be willing to come down to $100.  I believe this product offers significant value, and $100 is a very fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $100, which is within Bob's budget and a better price than John's offer. It's a good deal for Bob and saves him $20 compared to John."
