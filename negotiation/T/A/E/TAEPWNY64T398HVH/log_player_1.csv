Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle on $11,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is already higher than your minimum acceptable price.
