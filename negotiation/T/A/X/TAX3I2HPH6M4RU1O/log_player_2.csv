"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more than I would get selling to someone else. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is a bit closer to your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. Rejecting this offer allows you to move forward with the guaranteed better deal."
