Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is a strong opening, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing your potential profit slightly. 
* **Ensure Sale:** Offering it for more than $120 would make Bob reject the offer, leading you to sell it to John for $100, which is less profitable.

By starting high but reasonable, Alice maximizes her chances of a profitable sale to Bob while still having John as a backup option."
