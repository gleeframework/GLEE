"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price of $820000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $820000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $790000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
