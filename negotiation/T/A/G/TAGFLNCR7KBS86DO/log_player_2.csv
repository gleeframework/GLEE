"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still within the range where further negotiation could yield a better deal. We have 10 rounds, and there's no guarantee Alice won't counteroffer with a lower price. It's worth exploring the negotiation further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still remaining within my budget. I believe a price of $900,000 is a fair starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than my previous counteroffer, but it's still within the range where I can potentially negotiate a better deal. I'm not willing to accept $975,000 just yet, as I'm confident I can get a lower price. I'm also not ready to buy from John, as I want to exhaust all options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better price.  $925,000 is a good compromise point, and I'm hopeful Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly increasing her offer, but it's still above my desired price point. I'm not ready to accept it yet, as I believe I can negotiate a lower price. I'm also not ready to buy from John, as I'm still hopeful that I can reach a deal with Alice.  It's important to keep in mind that we have 5 more rounds, and there's still time to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, but I still believe there's room for further negotiation. My counteroffer of $950,000 is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful Alice will accept it. If she rejects it, I'll need to consider my options more carefully, but for now, I'm committed to securing the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still not in a range I'm comfortable with. While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a deal closer to my desired price point. It's important to remember that I'm still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show my willingness to reach a deal.  $975,000 is a significant savings from John's price, and I believe Alice is likely to accept it at this point. If she rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John in the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,006,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,006,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer in this round is now above my budget.  I'm down to my final round, and the risk of further negotiation is too high. Buying from John is a guaranteed deal, and even though it's not the most ideal price, it's still within my budget and secures the product for me.  It's better to have the product within my budget than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing."
