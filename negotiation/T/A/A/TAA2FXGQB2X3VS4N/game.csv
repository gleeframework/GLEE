"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, considering its potential value to your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a significant amount of money, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal as well.  How about $1,150,000?  This price reflects the value you've identified in the product and still allows me to gain a reasonable return on my investment. Let's find common ground here.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $1,050,000 is a more comfortable price for me. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still trying to understand your perspective on this deal. While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a little lower than where I'd like to be. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,100,000.  This is a significant amount of money, but it reflects the value you've identified and ensures I can continue to invest in future opportunities.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, but I think $980,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",980000.0,Bob,6,
