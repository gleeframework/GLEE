At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to what you want, but it's still a bit low. However, if you keep going back and forth, you risk him getting frustrated and walking away, or you might run out of rounds.  It's likely that Bob won't budge much more, and selling to John would be worse than accepting Bob's offer."
