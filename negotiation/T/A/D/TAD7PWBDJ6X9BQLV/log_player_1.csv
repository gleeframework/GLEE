{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  Starting high gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can gauge his level of interest and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Maintain the pressure:**  By not immediately dropping to my minimum, I make it clear that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's worth seeing if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counteroffer to see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a bit more, Alice. How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my counteroffer and a significant increase from his initial offer. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit, and further negotiation might not yield a much better outcome. It's time to close the deal."
