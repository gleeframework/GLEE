"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential profit. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm not afraid to aim high.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,800,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for more. I believe the product's value justifies a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, but it still reflects my belief in the product's value. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I still think I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still within a reasonable range. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a price that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While Bob's offer is my minimum price, I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a higher price.  I've already made several concessions, and it's unlikely Bob will budge further.  Selling to John ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoid further negotiation risk."
