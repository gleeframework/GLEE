"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product, given its value to me. Let me know if you're open to that price.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8500. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you while also being fair to me.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm happy to meet you at $8250, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8250. I'm willing to meet you at $8500, but I'm also considering other options. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",8250.0,Alice,5,
