{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You're aware that the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($40) while still ensuring Bob gets it for less than its worth to him. This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
