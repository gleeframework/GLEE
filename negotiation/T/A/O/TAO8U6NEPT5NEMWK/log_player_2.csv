"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation of the product, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he's starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This aggressive approach might push Alice to negotiate further.  This price is still within Bob's budget and offers a substantial savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above what he'd ideally pay.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to counter and potentially secure a price closer to his target. He has multiple rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price. This price is the same as what John is willing to sell the product for. By offering this price, Bob is signaling that he is serious about buying the product but is also unwilling to go any higher. This might push Alice to accept the offer, as it's still above her minimum acceptable price.  If Alice rejects, Bob can still choose to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $25,000 more than what John is selling for.  This is a small enough price difference that it makes sense for Bob to accept and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  If Bob rejects, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and he could end up buying from John for the same price anyway.  This is a reasonable compromise to secure the product without risking further negotiation."
