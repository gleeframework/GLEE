Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $8,000 for the product, so anything less is unacceptable.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so I have room to negotiate.
* **First Offer:** Starting with $12,000 is a good middle ground. It gives Bob a good deal while still giving me a significant profit.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John allows me to be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while ensuring I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $10,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly less than the $12,000 I initially offered.
* **Potential for More:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, and there's still room for me to get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John for $8,000 would be a loss compared to what I believe I can get from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Midpoint:** This offer is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a desire to reach a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Balancing Profit:** This price still yields a decent profit for me while giving Bob a better price than my initial offer.

This counteroffer aims to find common ground with Bob, encouraging him to accept and secure a sale while still getting a profitable price for myself."
