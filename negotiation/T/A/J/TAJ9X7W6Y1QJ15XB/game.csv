"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $800,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its worth.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. How about we try $900,000? I think that's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to move my offer up to $700,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product could be worthwhile.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to move up to $700,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make a slightly smaller adjustment to my original offer. How about we try $850,000? I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a little rich for me. I'd be willing to go to $750,000. This would be me stretching my budget, so I hope you can see I'm serious about purchasing the product.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to my original offer. How about we try $825,000? I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sensing some stubbornness on your end. I want to be upfront â€“ if we can't settle on $800,000, I'm going to have to walk.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",800000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your frustration, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to my original offer. How about we try $875,000? I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,9,
