"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with.  While I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This would still give you a good price and get us closer to a deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $825,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $875,000? This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let me know if you're interested.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
