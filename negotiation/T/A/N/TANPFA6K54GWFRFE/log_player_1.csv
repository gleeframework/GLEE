{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but above Bob's estimated value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll also be monitoring the negotiations closely to see if I need to move closer to John's offer if Bob becomes too difficult to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to drop that low. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find some middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with.  While I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This would still give you a good price and get us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm trying to be flexible, I'm not willing to sell at a price that undervalues the product for me. I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer to see if we can reach a more agreeable number."

{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $825,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $875,000? This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and it seems like we are at an impasse. It's not worth continuing the negotiation and potentially losing more time. Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum desired price, and it's a more efficient solution at this point."
