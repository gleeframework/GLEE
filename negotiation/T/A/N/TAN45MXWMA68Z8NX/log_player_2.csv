"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $130. This is a good deal, but you can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $125. This is a reasonable compromise, as it's halfway between Alice's offer and my desired price.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's still more than she values the product at."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly from the first round, but it's still above my desired price.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get her closer to $125.  I'm still hesitant to buy from John at $150, as I believe I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $130. This is a compromise, as I'm meeting Alice halfway from her last offer. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as it's still within my budget and likely more than she values the product at. I'm trying to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the same as her previous offer, which I rejected.  I'm not willing to pay $135 for the product, but I still believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. It's still better for me to try and get a lower price from Alice than to buy from John at $150. I have enough rounds left to try and reach an agreement with Alice that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly to $132. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also trying to push her closer to my desired price point. I'm hopeful that she will accept this offer, as it's still more than she values the product at and is closer to the middle ground.  I believe I can still get a better deal with Alice than going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $134. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $134
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $134, which is very close to my last offer of $132.  I've reached a point where I'm willing to accept the offer and buy the product. It's a good deal for me, as I'm still saving money compared to buying from John. While I'd love to get it for my target price of $125, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
