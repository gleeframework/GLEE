Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, something truly special. It's worth a lot to me, at least $1,000,000, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,500,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $1500000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This shows a good-faith effort from my end, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that. However, $900,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant concession.
