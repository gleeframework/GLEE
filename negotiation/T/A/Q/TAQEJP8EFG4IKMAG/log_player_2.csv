"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, something truly special. It's worth a lot to me, at least $1000000, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1500000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. It's best to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $1,500,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. While it's closer, I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This shows a good-faith effort from my end, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that. However, $900000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is a significant concession.  This is a final offer, and I'm ready to move on if it's not acceptable.  What's your decision? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above my budget, even though it's a lower price than her initial offers.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance she'll reject any lower counteroffer, and I'm already 5 rounds in.  It's better to secure the product from John at a known price of $800,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
