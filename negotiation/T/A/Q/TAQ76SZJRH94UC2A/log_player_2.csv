"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above my budget and what I think the product is worth. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you consider that?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to save as much money as possible, so I'm aiming for a price significantly lower than my $10,000 maximum. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  I've left room to increase my offer in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, the product is worth a lot to me. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good, but $12,000 is still closer to her value than mine. I think there's room for her to move further down in price. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:** I'm now offering my maximum price.  It's important to be clear about my limit to avoid dragging out the negotiation unnecessarily.
* **Seeking a Win-Win:**  I'm emphasizing that this price would be fair for both of us, hoping to encourage Alice to accept.
* **Backup Option:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely take John's offer to avoid the risk of the price going higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $10,000, Bob, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money. How about we meet at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to push for the highest price possible. While $11,500 is tempting, I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm sticking to my $10,000 limit and will see if she's willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is truly my limit. I understand this might not be your ideal price, but I hope you'll consider it. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm reiterating that $10,000 is my absolute maximum. Making it clear this is a final offer may encourage Alice to accept rather than risk losing the sale.
* **Polite but Firm:**  I want to maintain a good relationship with Alice, even if we don't reach an agreement. I'm being firm about my limit while expressing appreciation for her time.
* **John as Backup:** If Alice rejects this final offer, I'll likely buy from John for $10,000. There's no point in going back and forth further, as it's unlikely Alice will drop her price significantly enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $10,000, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make one more attempt to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still holding at a price above my absolute limit. It's clear she's not willing to meet me at $10,000. It's time to exercise my backup option and buy from John. This ensures I get the product at the best possible price for me."
