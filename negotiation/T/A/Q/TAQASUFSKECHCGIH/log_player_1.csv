"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I think we can work towards an even better deal. How about considering $850,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the value of the product to me."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $860,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000. I'll continue to see if I can get a better deal from Bob, but I won't settle for anything significantly lower than my minimum."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, $865,000 is still too far below my minimum price. I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000. I'll make one last counteroffer to Bob, but if he doesn't come closer to my target, I'll move on to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $866,000 is getting closer, we're running out of time, and it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I've reached the point where I'm not comfortable continuing to negotiate, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price than I'm willing to accept. I've decided to move on to John and sell the product to him for $1,000,000."
