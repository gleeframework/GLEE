Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how Alice should approach this offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000 (her safety net with John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to be made if Alice can find the right price.

**The Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,150,000 to you. This is a limited-time offer before I open it to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Why This Might Work**

* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,150,000 sets a strong initial point.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of his higher valuation.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing out.
* **Win-Win:** While the price is closer to Bob's valuation, it still gives Alice a significant profit above her minimum.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer. Alice needs to decide how low she's willing to go, keeping in mind her guaranteed sale to John.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, Alice might consider a slightly lower price for future opportunities."
