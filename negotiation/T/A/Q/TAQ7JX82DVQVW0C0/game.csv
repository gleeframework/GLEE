"Alice, $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for being open about your budget, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price that should be within your budget, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. Let's make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to both of us, considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I still can't go above $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on this product. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
