"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! I think it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high.  How about $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to meeting your budget, Bob. But I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  It's a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment. How about we meet at $10,875? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it's a compromise that works for me.",10875.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $10,875 is tempting, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. That's the best I can do.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're going in circles, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $10,800, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",10800.0,Alice,9,
