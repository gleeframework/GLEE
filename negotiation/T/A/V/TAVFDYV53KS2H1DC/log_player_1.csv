Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly justified the price, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies that the product is worth a significant amount.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is conversational (""What do you think?"") which invites Bob to engage in a dialogue and potentially negotiate the price.

It's important to note that this is just an opening offer.  Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her strategy accordingly."
