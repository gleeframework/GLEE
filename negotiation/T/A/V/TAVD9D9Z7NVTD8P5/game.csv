"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about $975,000? ",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. I'm willing to make another slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000, which is still a great deal considering its true value to you is $1,200,000.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to offer you $990,000 as a final attempt to reach a deal. This is a very fair price considering its actual value. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
