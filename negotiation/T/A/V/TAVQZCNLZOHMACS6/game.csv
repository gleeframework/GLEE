"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm hoping we can work out a deal for $925000.",925000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I believe the product's value justifies my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $975000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to benefit from this deal. ",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $912500. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",912500.0,Bob,4,
