Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.  I'll see if I can get a better counteroffer from Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,300,000? This would allow us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Bob is still too low. I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is just not going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000? This is the absolute lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Bob is not budging on his price, and I'm at a point where I need to make a decision. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below $1,250,000.  John is offering a much better price, so I'm going to take his offer."
