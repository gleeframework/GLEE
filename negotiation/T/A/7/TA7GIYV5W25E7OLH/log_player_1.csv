Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $120. It's a steal at this price! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm aiming for a price above Bob's value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Room for Counteroffers:** A $120 offer allows for several rounds of counteroffers without me having to immediately go down to my minimum.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $150 gives me a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $100 for this product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While $100 is a far cry from my ideal price, it's a better starting point than completely rejecting the deal. I can likely get more with a counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as an option for $150 allows me to take some risks during negotiation without feeling pressured to accept a price I'm not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price, but still maintaining a price above his offer and significantly above my minimum.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing my offer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Closing the Gap:**  A $115 counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and increases the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your price, Alice. I understand your position, but I can't go above $105 for this product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $105 is a better offer than before, it's still only slightly above Bob's initial offer.  It's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation for a price that's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum and a much better outcome than the current offer from Bob.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing valuable time and could potentially lead to an even lower offer from him. 

It's crucial to prioritize my minimum acceptable price and the certainty of a good deal with John."
