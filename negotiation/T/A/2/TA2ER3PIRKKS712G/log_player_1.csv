"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $2,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it will be worth every penny for you. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob's value for the product is unknown. This establishes a strong initial position and allows for negotiation room.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's unique qualities and potential benefits for Bob helps justify the price.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  Inviting further discussion encourages negotiation and keeps the lines of communication open. 

**Note:** This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. This gives me an opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 allows me to take a more assertive stance in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to secure a deal that's beneficial for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, but it still allows for a substantial return for you. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm offering a compromise by dropping the price from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, but justifying it by emphasizing the product's exceptional value and potential.
* **Firm but Fair:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and allows for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing that both parties can benefit from a deal at this price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but $1750000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While closer, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out:**  We are already in round 4, meaning I have limited rounds left to secure a deal. 
* **John's offer is a safe alternative:** I can't risk accepting a price lower than my minimum. John's offer provides a guaranteed minimum value for the product.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round with a price closer to my minimum, but I'll need to be cautious as I don't want to risk losing too much time and potentially ending up with John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still too low for this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, but this is my final offer.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final offer, as I want to secure a price closer to my minimum.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm dropping the price slightly from $1,750,000 to $1,550,000 to show flexibility but still maintain a comfortable margin.
* **Emphasis on Closure:**  I'm using strong language like ""final offer"" and ""close this deal"" to signal a deadline and urgency. 
* **Fair Deal:**  I'm reiterating that this price is fair and mutually beneficial to encourage acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully assess Bob's response to this final offer.  If he accepts, I've secured a good price.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider John's offer as I'm running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1450000, but I really think that's the maximum I can go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited time:**  We are in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds to reach an agreement.  
* **John's offer is a safe alternative:** I need to prioritize securing a price that meets my minimum. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum. I'll need to be strategic and try to close the deal quickly, as time is running out."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,450,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Considering its unique capabilities and potential, I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $1,500,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and it's the price John is willing to pay.  Let's make this deal happen, or I'll have to move forward with John."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  This is my final offer, emphasizing my firm stance and limited negotiation room.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I'm using John's offer as a strong motivator, highlighting that I have an alternative that meets my minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only three rounds left, I need to push for a decision.  
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value and potential to justify my price.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but I really think that's the maximum I can go. Can you consider this price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in Round 8, leaving only 2 rounds to close a deal.  
* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:** $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer guarantees my minimum:**  Selling to John at $1,500,000 ensures I get my minimum acceptable price. 

**I've made multiple concessions and have reached my limit.  It's not worth risking losing more time and potentially ending up with a price lower than my minimum.  John's offer is a safe and guaranteed alternative.**"
