{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm indicating a willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll be watching closely to see if Bob accepts or rejects my offer.
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter-counteroffer, always keeping my minimum price of $150 and John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I know I can sell the product to John for $150, which is a much better outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price would allow me to make a ""fair profit"", making it seem like a reasonable compromise.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm using an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and hopefully get Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll be closely watching Bob's response to this offer. 
* If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I want to make another counteroffer or simply accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John's offer remains the better option:**  Selling to John for $150 is a more profitable choice.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price very close to my minimum or slightly higher. 
* If he rejects, I will immediately accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $130 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to go down to $145, which is my absolute lowest price.  If you're not able to go higher than that, I'll have to accept another offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final counteroffer:** This is my last attempt to get a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing finality:** I'm using phrases like ""absolute lowest price"" and ""have to accept another offer"" to emphasize the urgency and the limited room for further negotiation.
* **Direct question:** I'm posing a direct question to get a clear response from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I will immediately accept John's offer of $150."
