"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $10000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest.  While $10000 is a good starting point,  I'm confident the product's value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $12000,  considering your initial offer. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to fairly compensate for the product's quality.  Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
