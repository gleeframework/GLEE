Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest.  While $10000 is a good starting point,  I'm confident the product's value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $12000,  considering your initial offer. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to fairly compensate for the product's quality.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
