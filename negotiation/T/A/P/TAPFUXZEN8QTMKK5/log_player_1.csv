"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth. How about $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price, and I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob or sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $7,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price reflects the true value of the product, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
