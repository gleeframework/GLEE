"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $19,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",19000.0,Bob,4,
