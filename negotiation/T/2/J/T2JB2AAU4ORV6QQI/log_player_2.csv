"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is well above his maximum budget, and he can get a better deal from John.  It's also a good starting point for negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. This is my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll need to look at other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,500,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum limit. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price, and he still has the option of buying from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This is my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,400,000 is getting closer to his budget, he still has room to negotiate and it's worth trying to get a lower price. He should continue to counter-offer and see if he can get Alice to come down further. However, if the negotiations fail, he can still buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to compromise.  However, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects our respective needs, and I'm confident we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000 for this product.  This is a great price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal and move on! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $1,375,000 is a good price, considering he has a safety net of buying from John for $1,000,000.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and risking another counteroffer could lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away. It's a good deal for Bob, and he should take it."
