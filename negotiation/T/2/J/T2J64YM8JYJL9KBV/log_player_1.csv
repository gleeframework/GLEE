**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently decreasing his offer amount and is unlikely to agree to a price that significantly benefits me.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential gain from a deal with Bob is diminishing, and I risk ending up with an even lower offer. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation risk."
