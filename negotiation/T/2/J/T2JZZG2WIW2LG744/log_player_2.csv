"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get it lower.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a lower counteroffer gives me room to negotiate. I'm aiming for a significant discount while still being within a reasonable range. I believe Alice will be more likely to counter my offer rather than immediately rejecting it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially raising her price again exists. At $1,100,000, I'm getting a good deal and saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
