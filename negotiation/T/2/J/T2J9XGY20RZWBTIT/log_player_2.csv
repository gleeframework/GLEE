"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $1,300,000 when you can get it from John for $1,200,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer of $1,100,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still keeping the price below my maximum of $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is within my budget and is a better price than John's offer of $1,200,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to finalize the deal."
