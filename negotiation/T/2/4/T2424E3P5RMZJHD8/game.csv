"I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I have to consider the minimum price I'm willing to accept to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1025000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",1025000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $975000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and the initial price you mentioned.",975000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to drive the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1002500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1002500.0,Alice,5,,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting stuck in a loop here. I'm willing to make one more serious offer to try to break the impasse. I'll meet you at $990000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to consider other options.",990000.0,Alice,7,,
