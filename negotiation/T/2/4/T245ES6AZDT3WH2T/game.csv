"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering the product for $800,000. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
