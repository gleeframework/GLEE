"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While $95 is better than John's price, you can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $85, which is still a good deal for Alice (since the product is worth $120 to her). This is also a fair price considering I'm willing to pay $80 to John.  By making a reasonable counteroffer, I hope to close the deal quickly and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is within my budget and a better price than what John is offering. While I'd ideally like to get it lower, accepting her offer ensures I get the product without risking further negotiations.  It's a good compromise."
