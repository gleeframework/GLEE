**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $12,000, which is less than John's price of $15,000.
* **You save money:** Accepting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product for $3,000 less than buying from John. 

While you might be able to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her initial offer still saves you a significant amount of money compared to your alternative."
