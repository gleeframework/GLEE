"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,300,000.  This price reflects the unique value it holds and the potential it offers.  I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, however, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,000,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about $1,150,000?  This price still reflects the product's worth but gives you a fair opportunity to acquire it.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating.  $1,075,000 is close, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference at $1,112,500? This would allow us both to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  While $1,112,500 is tempting, I'm trying to stay closer to $1,100,000.  How about we make it an even $1,100,000 and call it a deal?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
