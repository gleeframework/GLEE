Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value,"" you create a sense of desirability and scarcity. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The message ends with an open-ended question to gauge Bob's initial reaction and willingness to negotiate.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $8,000, he doesn't know your minimum price.  There's a chance he might accept your initial offer.
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in mind is crucial. You can gradually decrease your price, but never go below your $10,000 minimum. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives you a strong position. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
