Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my asking price of $1,050,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Higher Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is closer to Bob's valuation, it leaves some room for potential negotiation if needed.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  Offering a price closer to John's offer ($800,000) would be too low and leave potential profit on the table. Conversely, starting too high (close to $1,200,000) risks Bob rejecting the offer outright.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price that maximizes your profit while acknowledging his higher perceived value of the product."
