Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $865000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $870000 and $865000, which is $867500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $867,500 is a great price for Bob. It's only $7,500 above his target price of $860,000.  Considering the limited rounds remaining, it's more beneficial to accept this offer and close the deal, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's higher price of $800,000."
