"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $850000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $875000 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. I'm prepared to offer $860000. It's a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to finding a price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $860000. I'm willing to meet you at $870000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",870000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm at $870000. Let's find a middle ground. I'm ready to offer $865000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you say?",865000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $865000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $870000 and $865000, which is $867500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",867500.0,Alice,7,
