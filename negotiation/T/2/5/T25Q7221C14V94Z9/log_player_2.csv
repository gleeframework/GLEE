"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you placed on the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for Bob considering his value of $15,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge and he'll end up having to pay John $15,000. Accepting the offer secures a good price for Bob without risking a higher price later."
