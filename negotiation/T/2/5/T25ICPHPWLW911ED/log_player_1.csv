Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to Bob's valuation.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110.  This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, while also making sure I get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $105 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than selling to John for $80, and further negotiation might not lead to a much better outcome."
