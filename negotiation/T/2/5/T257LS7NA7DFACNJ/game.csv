"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues it considerably. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this time.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's split the difference. How about $1,275,000, and we close the deal?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
