"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We want to anchor the negotiation high, closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation signals that we're open to finding a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Professional Tone:** The message is framed positively and professionally, emphasizing the product's value without being overly aggressive.

This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option of negotiating down or accepting John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both our starting price and Bob's perceived value. We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. Selling to John at this point would be leaving a potential $200,000+ on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues it considerably. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims for a compromise, suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Strong but Flexible:** We're still holding firm on the product's value while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate a fair deal.
* **Time Consideration:**  We are still early in the negotiation, giving us space to maneuver before considering John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated to buy. We're still leaving a potential $50,000+ on the table if we accept.  We'll push a bit further, but need to carefully consider our next move as we are getting closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's split the difference. How about $1,275,000, and we close the deal?"",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tone:** This counteroffer signals that we are getting close to our bottom line. The language is direct and suggests finality, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** This shows continued willingness to compromise, but with a smaller concession than before.
* **Time Pressure:** We're moving closer to the halfway point in negotiations. This offer should prompt Bob to seriously consider his options.

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of closing the deal before needing to rely on John's offer."
