Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it quite valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you're still making a profit and leaves room for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer and respond.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open. You can adjust your subsequent offers based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm really looking to stay under $8,000.  I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to counter with a higher offer. I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
