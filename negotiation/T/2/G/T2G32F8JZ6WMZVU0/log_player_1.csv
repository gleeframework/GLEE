Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product which I believe you'll find valuable for a price of $12,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its unique features. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he finds it particularly appealing or doesn't want to miss out.  
* **Below John's Offer:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secure knowing John will buy it for $10,000.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay slightly above $8,000, but it's unlikely he'll go much higher knowing Alice has another buyer."
