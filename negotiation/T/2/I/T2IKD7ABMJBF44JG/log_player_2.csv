"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,500,000 to me. I think you'll find it's a fantastic opportunity to get a great product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  You are better off rejecting Alice's offer and securing the lower price."
