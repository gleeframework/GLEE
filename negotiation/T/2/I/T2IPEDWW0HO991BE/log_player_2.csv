{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try and negotiate, especially since you know you have a fallback option with John.  By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $100 sets the stage for negotiation. This price is still within your budget and leaves room for potential compromise. By offering a lower price, you demonstrate your intention to bargain and potentially save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a good compromise. It's better than my initial counteroffer and still saves me $10 compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product and saves me time and effort in further negotiation."
