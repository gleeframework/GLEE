"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let you have it for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $150, and Alice's offer of $115 is significantly lower than that.
* **Saving Money:**  While Bob could try to get a lower price, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting this offer saves Bob $35 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away entirely or not budging on the price.  Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product for a reasonable price."
