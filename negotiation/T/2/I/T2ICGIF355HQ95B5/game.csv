"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I want to be fair. However, $120 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept.  Would you consider $145? That's a significant compromise on my end.",145.0,Alice,5,
