"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $950,000. I'd be willing to pay $920,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Bob,4,
