"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Since you're willing to pay up to $150, there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's initial offer.  Rejecting allows you to explore if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $125, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  It also gives her some room to counter without immediately reaching my maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my target, it's still above my ideal price. I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if I can get it lower. It's not worth paying more than I have to, especially since I have more rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $135. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal.  This is also a good compromise point, potentially allowing Alice to accept without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $137.5 is very close to my target price of $135. I've already rejected several offers and we're nearing the halfway point in negotiations.  There's a risk of further negotiation going back and forth without a clear outcome, and I might end up paying more if I keep rejecting.  It's a good deal, and accepting minimizes the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
