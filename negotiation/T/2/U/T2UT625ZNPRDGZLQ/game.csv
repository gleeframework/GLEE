"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows us both to have a successful deal.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
