"Alice,  $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in your product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit below where I need to be. Considering your interest and the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the potential benefits to you.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the potential value for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we keep working together.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Given the potential value of this product for you, I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,000,000 is still below my minimum.  However, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and allows us to finalize this transaction. Let's close the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to finalize this deal at a lower price. I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,8,
