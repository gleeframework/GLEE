"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can see the potential value this product can bring to your business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's better to continue negotiating to try to get a lower price, or to simply purchase from John to avoid further negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's more advantageous for Bob to simply purchase the product from John, as it will save him $100,000.  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and the risk of a longer negotiation process isn't worth the potential savings."
