"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1200000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the potential value to my business.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can see the potential value this product can bring to your business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
