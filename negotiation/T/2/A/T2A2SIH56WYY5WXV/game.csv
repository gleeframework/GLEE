"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in the product, and allows for a fair and mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring your product and hopefully we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
