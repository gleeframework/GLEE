"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  I'm also leaving some room for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my desired profit margin. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm reducing my price from the initial offer, but not by too much. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. It's risky to accept at this point, as I might be able to get closer to $12,000 or $13,000 in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to make a small counteroffer, raising the price by $500. Bob is clearly willing to go above $10,000, so I'm hoping this small increase will encourage him to close the deal. I want to see if we can reach a compromise without jeopardizing my chance to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are stagnating and we're nearing the end of our rounds.  I don't want to risk getting stuck at a price that is far below my desired profit margin. Selling to John at $15,000 is the best course of action to guarantee a significant profit."
