"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item that will bring you a lot of benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $8,500 is still more than I'd like to spend.  How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $8,500, which is $7,750. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it in the long run.",7750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position Alice, and I'm willing to keep talking.  Would you consider $7,600?",7600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob! I can see that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $7,700, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle again and see if we can get a deal done.",7700.0,Alice,7,
