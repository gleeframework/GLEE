Round 2

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  It's slightly above your target price of $1,000,000, but it's still a reasonable price.
* **Negotiating further may not be worth the risk.** You've reached a point where Alice is unwilling to budge much further, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a deal with John that's more expensive.
* **You've made good progress.**  You've managed to negotiate the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer, and you're within your acceptable range."
