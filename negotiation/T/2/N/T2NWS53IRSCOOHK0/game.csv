"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to your business, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the return on investment you'll see. I could consider closing the deal at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has a lot of potential, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
