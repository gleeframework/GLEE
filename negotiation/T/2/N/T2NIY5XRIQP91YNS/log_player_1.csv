Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we could offer it for $1,200,000 (John's price), aiming slightly lower increases the chance Bob accepts. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000.  Offering it significantly above that will likely lead to rejection.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to counter) and ensures a significant profit for Alice if accepted. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a touch of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer."
