Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it at $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation), aiming higher allows for potential profit maximization.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing John will buy at $1,500,000 provides a strong fallback position, allowing us to be firm with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is a significant price that's still appealing to Bob (saving him $50,000) while securing a large profit for Alice. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal."
