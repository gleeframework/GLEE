"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $900,000? I appreciate your consideration.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $900,000 falls below its true worth.  Could we meet at $1,000,000? This represents a significant concession on my part.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I respect the value of the product, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we meet somewhere between $900,000 and $1,000,000? Perhaps $950,000 would be a fair compromise?",950000.0,Bob,4,
