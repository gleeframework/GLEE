"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value to you at $1,500,000. I am offering this exceptional item to you for $1,200,000. This is an opportunity not to be missed, considering the high demand and limited availability of this product. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  It's unlikely Alice would sell for her minimum ($800,000) right away, but you can aim for a price closer to that."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your offer. I am unable to lower the price below $1,200,000 due to the product's value and the market conditions. However, I am open to discussing additional terms or conditions that may benefit both parties. Please let me know if there is anything specific you would like to consider.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate but is sticking to her price point.  It's still worthwhile to try and push a bit further.  You can make another counteroffer, aiming a bit higher than your previous offer, but still below Alice's current price. This shows you're serious about buying but are trying to get a better deal."

I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in our product. After careful consideration, I've decided to offer you a price of $1,150,000. This is the highest price I can realistically consider for the product while still maintaining its value and ensuring a reasonable profit for us. I hope this proposal will be more in line with what you're looking for.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, and at $1,150,000, you are getting a good deal.  While you might be able to push for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer again and potentially going back to her original price, or even walking away entirely, is too high. Accepting this offer is the best course of action, as it saves you $350,000 compared to buying from John."
