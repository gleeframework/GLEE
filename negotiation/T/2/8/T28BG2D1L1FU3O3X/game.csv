"Alice,  $18000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 for it.  This is my absolute maximum, so I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your absolute maximum, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still out of my range. I'm going to offer $9500.  This is a significant increase from my last offer and really pushes my budget, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11000. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings, and I think you'll be happy with the compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting really close to my limit here, but I'm willing to go to $10000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can agree on it.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're making a serious effort to reach a deal, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11500. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
