"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
