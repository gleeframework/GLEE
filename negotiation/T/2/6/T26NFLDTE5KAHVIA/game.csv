"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $875000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the market demand.",875000.0,Alice,3,
