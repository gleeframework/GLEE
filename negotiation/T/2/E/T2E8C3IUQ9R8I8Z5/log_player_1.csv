"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit. I'm confident the product is valuable to Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate but want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value.  I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and with only 6 rounds remaining, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting. I'm happy to accept this offer and secure a good deal."
