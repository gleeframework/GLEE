"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you!  It's valued at no less than $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to make a sale, $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $8,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a reasonable profit while still getting you a great deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
