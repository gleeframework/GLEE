"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested in the product,  $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you think it's a good deal for both of us. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from our initial discussion.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I am too. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14000.  However,  $13000 is the highest I can go at this point. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I need to make a bit more than that to justify the value of the product. How about we compromise at $13500? It's still a fair price, and I'm willing to make it work.",13500.0,Alice,5,
