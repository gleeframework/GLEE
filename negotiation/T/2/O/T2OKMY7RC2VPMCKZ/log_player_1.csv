"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate. The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to start a positive conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable value, there's still potential to earn more.  Rejecting allows us to continue negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Bob for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm confident the product is worth more.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,500? "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm getting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is a good offer, we're still in early rounds and there's room to negotiate further. Rejecting allows us to explore a potential higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference this time?  $11,500 would be a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  I'm going to offer $11250. This is my final offer, I'm afraid I can't go any higher.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

We've reached round 6 and Bob's offer is only $250 less than our previous counteroffer. This is close to our desired price, and with only 4 rounds remaining, there's a risk of losing a sale. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of ending up with only John's $10,000 offer."
