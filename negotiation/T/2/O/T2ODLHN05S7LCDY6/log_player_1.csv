Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counter-offer.  I understand your budget constraints, however the value of this product is significant.  I could come down to $1,400,000, which I believe is a very competitive offer."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. However, given my financial situation, I am unable to meet at $1,400,000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,375,000 for the product. This amount allows me to stay within my budget while still acknowledging the value of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly signaling this is his ceiling. Accepting $1,375,000 is a significant profit over my minimum, and avoids the risk of continued negotiation."
