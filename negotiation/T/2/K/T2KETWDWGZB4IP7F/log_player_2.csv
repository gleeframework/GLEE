{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is far too expensive at $1,200,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $700,000. This is well below Alice's initial price and closer to my maximum budget. It's a strong starting point for negotiation."

While $900,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate further."

``` 
While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still going to reject it. I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a final offer and if Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is only $25,000 less than John's price.  It's not worth risking another round of negotiation when I can get a guaranteed deal with John."
