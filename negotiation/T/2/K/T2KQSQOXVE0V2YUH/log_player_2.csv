"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:**  $1,200,000 is less than $1,500,000.
* **You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000:**  This means you can afford Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John."
