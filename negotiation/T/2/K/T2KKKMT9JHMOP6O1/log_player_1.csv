``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him a small incentive to accept. It's also below my minimum, leaving room for negotiation if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, well below my minimum.  I will counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $10,500 to make this work.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I understand the product's value, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll counteroffer once more to try and reach a more agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
