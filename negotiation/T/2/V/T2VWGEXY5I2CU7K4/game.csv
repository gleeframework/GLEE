"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's less than what it's worth to you and more than what I would get from selling it elsewhere. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,1,
