{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum. I believe it's a good starting point and allows me to see if Bob is serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to sell for that price just yet. I'll counteroffer, aiming to find a price closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm unable to meet at $9,000. Would you consider $8,500 as a fair price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, Bob's offer of $8,500 is still a significant profit for me. It's higher than John's offer, and it seems like Bob is serious about buying. It's time to close the deal."
