"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is a strong starting point.  It's a fair price that leaves room for negotiation, but still secures a profit for me. I'm confident Bob will see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I want to sell the product, $10,000 is unacceptable. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is my absolute minimum.  This is still a great price considering what it's worth to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still losing a good chunk of profit. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I can't go any lower than $12,000. This is a fair price considering what the product is worth to you, and it also covers my minimum acceptable profit.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
