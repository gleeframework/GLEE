Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  Knowing the product is worth $100 to Bob, starting at $95 aims to capture a significant portion of the value he places on it while still leaving you room to potentially go lower. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer is significantly above your $80 minimum, ensuring a profitable sale if Bob accepts.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the initial offer and countering with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below both your initial asking price and the product's value to him.  Here's why rejecting and countering is the stronger move:

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob offering $70 after you started at $95 indicates there's room for negotiation. He's clearly interested in the product but trying to get a better deal. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to accept a low offer.
* **Signal Value:** Rejecting Bob's low offer signals that you value the product and are serious about getting a fair price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can propose a counteroffer closer to your desired range, aiming for a win-win outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $70 is significantly below the value of this product.  I could come down to $87, which I think is a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 87
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your initial offer ($95) and Bob's counteroffer ($70). It signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price point.
* **Strategic Justification:** By mentioning the ""value of this product,"" you subtly remind Bob that it's worth more than his offer.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** $87 is still a comfortable margin above your minimum acceptable price ($80) and keeps the negotiation alive to potentially reach an even better agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $70 is quite low. How about we split the difference and do $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 now matches your minimum acceptable price and what John is offering.  Here's why it makes sense to accept:

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** You're securing your desired profit margin.
* **Avoiding Further Risk:**  Continuing negotiation could lead to Bob lowering his offer or reaching an impasse, potentially forcing you to sell to John anyway.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now avoids a protracted negotiation, allowing you to move on to other opportunities or potential buyers. 

While there might be a slim chance of getting a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of losing the sale entirely outweighs the potential reward at this point."
