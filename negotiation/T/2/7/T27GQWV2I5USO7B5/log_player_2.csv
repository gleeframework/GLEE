"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to accept Alice's offer immediately.  Rejecting and counteroffering gives Bob a chance to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $850,000 is a reasonable starting point, significantly lower than Alice's offer but still potentially profitable for Alice.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves space for Alice to counter back. 
* **Keeping the negotiation alive:**  Bob needs to ensure Alice is willing to continue the negotiation, so a too-low counteroffer might be rejected outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer:**  Alice is trying to increase the price, which is not a good sign for Bob. 
* **Still better than John:**  Alice's offer is still lower than John's price, so it's worth continuing the negotiation.
* **Counteroffering strategy:**  Rejecting and counteroffering allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate but staying below Alice's latest offer.
* **Fair compromise:**  $875,000 is a potential middle ground, which might be acceptable to both parties.
* **Keeping Alice engaged:**  A moderate counteroffer helps keep the negotiation going and avoids immediate rejection."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is increasing:**  Alice keeps raising her price, making it less appealing for Bob.
* **Risk of stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate where Alice might keep raising the price until it's no longer beneficial for Bob.
* **John's offer still available:**  Buying from John at $1,000,000 is still a possibility and a guaranteed outcome, whereas Alice's negotiation is getting riskier.

**Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting Alice's offer and sending a counteroffer could potentially lower the price, but the risk of Alice ending the negotiation is increasing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic increase:**  Bob needs to slightly increase his offer to show Alice that he is willing to negotiate but not willing to be bullied. Increasing to $885,000 is a small increment from the previous offer, but it could be enough to convince Alice to come down.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  This counteroffer is still significantly less than John's price, but it's high enough to keep the negotiation alive while minimizing the risk of a deadlock.
* **Pressure tactic:**  By not accepting Alice's offer and counteroffering, Bob is putting pressure on Alice to find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting too high:** Alice is continuously increasing her price, making it less advantageous for Bob. The negotiation is becoming a losing battle. 
* **Risk of losing more time:** Further negotiation with Alice is becoming risky. She might continue raising the price, making the deal even worse for Bob.
* **John's offer is a safe option:**  At this point, buying from John at $1,000,000 is a guaranteed deal and a better choice than continuing with Alice. The risk of losing more time and ending up with a worse deal is too high. 

**Conclusion:** 
Bob should take the guaranteed deal from John to avoid further potential losses and risks associated with continuing the negotiation with Alice."
