"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize potential profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the product's worth to Bob, making the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While $95 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin and the value the product holds for Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation, especially since Bob has already shown interest.  
* **No Time Pressure:** We are still early in the negotiation process, and I have plenty of rounds to improve the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by dropping the price from $120 to $105, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Middle Ground:** This offer aims to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I think $100 would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob has moved closer to my desired price point, and $100 is a significant improvement over his previous offer of $95.
* **Minimizing Risk:** With 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  Accepting this offer ensures a profit that's considerably higher than selling to John.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  While I might prefer a slightly higher price, $100 represents a fair compromise and a good outcome considering the potential for Bob to reject further offers."
