{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for you.
* **The message** is friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation open and positive.
* **This offer allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob**, giving you the opportunity to work towards a price closer to your minimum of $15,000.

Remember, this is just a starting point. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Selling to John for $15,000 is the most profitable option, but I want to see if I can push Bob higher before I commit. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your business,  $9,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000** is a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired price.  It's a significant step closer to my target while still showing some flexibility.
* **The message** remains friendly and positive, acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing willingness to negotiate further. 
* **This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise.** If he's serious about purchasing the product, he might be willing to meet me halfway.

I'm still prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am unable to meet the price of $11,000. I am still interested in purchasing the product, so I am proposing $10,000 as my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offers, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to budge significantly on his price. 

Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price, it's more advantageous to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
