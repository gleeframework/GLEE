Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product while also being mindful of your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $1,150,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a final offer, as I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's close this deal.
