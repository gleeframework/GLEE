"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing the price further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests it's generally advantageous to start with a strong offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the product's worth $1,500,000 to Alice, the initial offer provides space for concessions and counteroffers.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** Bob's response to this high starting price will provide valuable insight into his level of interest and flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a more agreeable price. My counteroffer for the product is $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant move in the right direction, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. By rejecting this offer, Alice signals that she's looking for a price closer to her initial ask. There's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us. To move things along, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the product's true value and the benefits it offers. "",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice lowers her price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but the concession is relatively small, keeping the price significantly above Bob's offer.
* **Justification:** Alice subtly reinforces the product's value, aiming to justify the higher price point.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and encourages Bob to make further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to Alice's minimum, she still has some negotiating power. There are several rounds left, and she's willing to risk a lower counter-offer from Bob to see if she can get closer to $1,800,000.  She's balancing the potential profit against the risk of Bob walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground here. I've given your latest proposal some thought, and I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,825,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting a price directly in the middle of their last two offers, Alice demonstrates a willingness to compromise and creates an appearance of fairness.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is still comfortably above Alice's minimum price, maximizing her potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** With half the rounds gone, Alice subtly introduces a sense of urgency to encourage Bob towards a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to propose a final offer of $1,775,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, increasing the likelihood that he won't budge much higher. 
* **Profitable Deal:**  $1,775,000 is a significant profit above Alice's minimum. Accepting ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows Alice to utilize the funds sooner rather than risking further negotiation for a potentially insignificant gain."
