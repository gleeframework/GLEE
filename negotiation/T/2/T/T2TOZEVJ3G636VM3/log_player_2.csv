"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, $120 is still more than your maximum budget of $80. John offers you a better deal at $80, allowing you to stay within your budget."
