"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it allows room for negotiation and leaves a good potential profit margin. It's important to gauge Bob's interest before jumping to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price.  It's worth exploring if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement before taking the safe option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm moving down from my initial offer, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. I believe $17,000 is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. Even if we don't reach an agreement, the information we gain from this back-and-forth might help us with a better counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm dropping my price again, but this time to my absolute minimum.  I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but I won't go any lower. Hopefully, this will push Bob to accept the offer or make a counteroffer closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I want to see if Bob will move closer to my $15,000 floor before selling to John. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This is my final counteroffer before considering selling to John. I'm dropping the price slightly again to show my willingness to compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
