"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $950000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $875000? I believe this might bring us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $925000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $900000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $925000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I've done my best to accommodate your needs. Unfortunately, I cannot meet the $925000 price point. My final offer is $910000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement that works for both of us.",910000.0,Bob,6,
