"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $12000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  How about we split the difference? I'm happy to come down to $15000.  This gives us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with what this product can do for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $13500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to come up in price.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $14250. This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",14250.0,Alice,5,
