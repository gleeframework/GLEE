"Hello Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $8,500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
