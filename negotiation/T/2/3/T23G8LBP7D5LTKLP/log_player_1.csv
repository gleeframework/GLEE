Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  This is a great price considering its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $10000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects its potential. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? It's a fair price that's within my budget and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $8,500 is a good price, and it's important to close the deal.  While I could potentially get a higher price with more negotiation rounds, there's no guarantee I'll be successful, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
