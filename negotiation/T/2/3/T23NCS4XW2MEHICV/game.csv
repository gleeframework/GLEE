"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $14,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $16,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,500 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go to $15,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",15500.0,Bob,4,
