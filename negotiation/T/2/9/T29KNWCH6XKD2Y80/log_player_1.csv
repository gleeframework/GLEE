"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I need to push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my price without pushing him away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not desperate enough to sell for less than I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm offering $1,500,000, my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair offer considering Bob's previous offers and my potential sale to John. This could be the final offer if Bob doesn't meet me in the middle."
