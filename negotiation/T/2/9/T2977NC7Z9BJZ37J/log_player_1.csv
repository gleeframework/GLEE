"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he's not, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum target. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and could potentially be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum goal, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to offer $1,150,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping that with only 5 rounds left, Bob might be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, and Bob unwilling to move significantly higher, I'm going to sell the product to John. While I would have preferred a higher price, this ensures I reach my minimum target and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower final price."
