Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially gets Bob to think about how much he truly wants the product.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not asking for my absolute minimum ($100). This allows Bob to feel like he can negotiate and potentially come to a price that feels fair to both of us. 
* **John as Backup:** The fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $100 acts as a safety net. If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I know I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Close:** While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum of $100, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Opportunity to Negotiate Further:** I believe I can get a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.  I'm confident that Bob values the product and is willing to pay closer to my minimum.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I'm not in a desperate position. I can always sell to John for $100 if this negotiation falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $98. This is my final offer before I move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price to $98, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. This keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Final Offer:** I'm establishing a sense of urgency by stating that this is my final offer. This might encourage Bob to accept rather than risk losing the product.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum price of $100, ensuring I get a fair price. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I reiterate my ability to sell to John, reminding Bob that the clock is ticking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my request. I am willing to pay $96 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $96 is only $4 below my minimum of $100.  
* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, and further negotiation could risk losing the sale. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is $4 higher, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a better outcome. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively safe sale, especially considering the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
