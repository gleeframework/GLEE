Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. I think that's the lowest price I can reasonably accept for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her $13,500 offer.  It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
