"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you my product for $115. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product but $115 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $105 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to consider your offer at $110, as it is closer to the value I place on the product. I look forward to your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is within Bob's budget of $120 and only $5 more than his last offer. This is a reasonable compromise that allows Bob to save some money compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better price, so accepting the offer is the most sensible option at this point."
