"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand $22,000 is a significant jump from your offer, so let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $18,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide excellent value at that price.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but $18,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $12,000?  I'm serious about buying this, but I need to stick to my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
