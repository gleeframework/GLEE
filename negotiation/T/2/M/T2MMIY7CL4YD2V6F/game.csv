"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
