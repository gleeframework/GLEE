"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for something worth at least $100 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price above what the product is worth to me ($100) and a bit higher than what it's worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than his initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm not giving up on getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price that's still beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is halfway between my initial offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $90. It's still above my minimum price of $100, but it shows flexibility and willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  $95 is closer to my minimum price of $100, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  John is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still committed to finding a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is my absolute minimum, but it's still a great deal for a product worth this much.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

I'm offering $100. This is my minimum price, but it's a fair price considering the value of the product. It shows flexibility and demonstrates my willingness to close the deal, hopefully leading Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to consider a price of $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but his offers are still below my desired price. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob is high. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $100, ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal."
