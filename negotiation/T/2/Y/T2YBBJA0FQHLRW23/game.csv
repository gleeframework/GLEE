"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I can get out of the product for my business. Can you consider this offer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value this product can bring to your business. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't go lower than $1100000. This still represents a substantial saving for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1050000. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
