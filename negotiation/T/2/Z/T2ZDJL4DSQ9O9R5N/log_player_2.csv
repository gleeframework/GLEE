"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above his ideal price point.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but it's still significantly higher than Alice's desired price. This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. If she rejects, he can continue to lower the price incrementally in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his $10,000 target.  He has time and rounds left, so he should continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally lowering his offer, showing his willingness to compromise.  He's hoping to find a price point where Alice is willing to meet him in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While $11,200 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's getting very close. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's likely that further negotiation will only yield small price decreases.  It's a good time for Bob to accept and secure the product, saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
