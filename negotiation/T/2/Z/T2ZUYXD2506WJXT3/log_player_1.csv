Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin above my minimum price of $150, but it's not too high that it would immediately deter Bob from considering a purchase. I'll be ready to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I will make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still a decent profit for me, but it's also closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't go too far below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's still a profit for me.  I don't want to risk losing a sale by continuing to negotiate and possibly ending up selling to John for the lower price of $150.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
