"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great return on investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider my costs and the value I've attached to the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $9,000. How about we discuss $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,000 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but $11,500 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to offer $10,250. This is a fair offer considering your original asking price and the value I place on the product.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm not willing to give up much more. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This would be a win-win for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11,250? I think this is as low as I can go and still make this deal worthwhile for me.",11250.0,Alice,9,
