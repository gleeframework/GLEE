Round 9
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

It's getting too risky to continue. Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** This is Round 9 out of 10. If we reject this offer, there's a chance we won't reach a deal with Alice and will be forced to buy from John at the much higher price of $15,000. 
* **Alice is unlikely to budge much:**  Alice has consistently stayed above $11,000. While we could try for one more counteroffer, it's unlikely she'll drop significantly below $11,250.
* **Saving some money is better than none:** Accepting $11,250 isn't ideal, but it's significantly less than John's $15,000 price. 

It's better to secure a reasonable deal now than risk losing out completely."
