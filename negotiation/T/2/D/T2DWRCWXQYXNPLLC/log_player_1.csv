"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $14,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'm rejecting his offer to try and get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to what I think the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but with only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Selling to John at $12,000 ensures I meet my minimum and avoids potentially losing the deal altogether."
