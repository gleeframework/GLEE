"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're looking for the best price, so it's wise to see if you can get Alice to lower her price further.  You can counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $100 on this product. Would you be willing to come down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $108. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still only willing to pay $100, and Alice is getting closer to that price. Keep negotiating to see if you can get her to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for $100.  Would you consider $102?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets me closer to my goal."", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you the product for $109. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where Alice is unlikely to drop her price any further. While $109 is close to your goal, you can get the product for $100 from John.  It's better to secure the product at the price you're comfortable with rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
