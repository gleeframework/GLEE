"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping for something a little more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is a concern, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $700,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my current budget. How about $675,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $685,000. This is as close to your target as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",685000.0,Alice,5,
