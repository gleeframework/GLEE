{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than your guaranteed minimum value ($1,000,000), leaving room for negotiation. 
* This offer is **bold** and shows confidence in the product's value. 
* It's likely that Bob will counter-offer, giving you an opportunity to negotiate a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic starting point, and the actual negotiation process would involve factors like:

* **Bob's estimated value for the product.** If you have any information about Bob's potential needs, you could adjust your offer accordingly.
* **Your willingness to compromise.** If you're desperate for a sale, you might be more inclined to accept a lower offer. 
* **Market conditions.** The current market for similar products could influence your pricing strategy."
