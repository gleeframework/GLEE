Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product but still lower than your minimum price.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring you get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum price of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $90. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $87.50 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  Negotiating further might take too much time and effort, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.  It's better to sell to John and avoid the risk of not getting a satisfactory price from Bob."
