"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8500.  It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,6,
