"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still too much for me. Let's keep working towards a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your previous offer, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
