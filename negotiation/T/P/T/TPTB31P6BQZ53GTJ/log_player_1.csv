``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price gives me room to negotiate down if necessary without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fantastic deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of value."

* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John's offer guarantees me my desired price, and I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob.
