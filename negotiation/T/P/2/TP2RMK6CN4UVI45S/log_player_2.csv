"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within his budget, it's still above his ideal price of $1,200,000. It's worth exploring if he can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant step closer to your desired price point. I believe this offer is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a price that's closer to my minimum value. Let's try $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still above Bob's desired price of $1,200,000. Bob is trying to get the best possible deal and should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price that's too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,325,000 and $1,350,000, which is $1,337,500. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,337,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $1,337,500 is still above his budget. Bob should continue to negotiate, as he still has rounds left and could potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,337,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,312,500.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it shows my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1312500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,312,500 is sufficient. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. Let's try $1,325,000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a 2-year warranty and dedicated support. I believe this package is worth considering, and I'm confident we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering additional perks with her latest offer, the price of $1,325,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Given that he has limited rounds remaining and Alice is showing a reluctance to budge much further, it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob won't be able to negotiate a price below $1,300,000.  Buying the product from John for $1,200,000 is the most cost-effective option at this point."
