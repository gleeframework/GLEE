"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, the value this product brings is significant, and I can't let it go for anything less than $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $980,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",980000.0,Bob,4,
