"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe is an excellent match for your needs. Considering its value and quality, we propose a price of $900,000 for this exclusive opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $850,000.  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your offer, we've decided to counter with a price of $875,000. This reflects our commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution while maintaining the value of our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within Bob's budget. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject a lower offer and the negotiation could drag on.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a price that is close to Bob's ideal target, and he avoids any potential risks associated with further negotiation."
