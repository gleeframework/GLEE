""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's good to know his initial valuation, accepting would mean a significant loss. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was already reflective of the potential I see in your hands.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest. I believe it's a fair compromise considering our differing perspectives on the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable range, but it's still considerably below my minimum. I need to incentivize him to move significantly closer to my price point, or I'll take John's offer soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This offer takes into account your increased investment while ensuring the value of the product is recognized."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects both our needs and the value we see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Explanation:

While Bob is showing more flexibility, he's still significantly below my $1,500,000 baseline. It's unlikely he'll bridge that gap in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob not meeting it.  It's time to move on to a guaranteed sale."
