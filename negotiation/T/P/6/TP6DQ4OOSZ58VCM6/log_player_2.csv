{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify that price.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was already reflective of the potential I see in your hands.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,900,000 is still way too high. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest. I believe it's a fair compromise considering our differing perspectives on the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This offer takes into account your increased investment while ensuring the value of the product is recognized.

While Alice is getting closer, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
