"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was already reflective of the potential I see in your hands.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of this product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest. I believe it's a fair compromise considering our differing perspectives on the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This offer takes into account your increased investment while ensuring the value of the product is recognized.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects both our needs and the value we see in this product.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
