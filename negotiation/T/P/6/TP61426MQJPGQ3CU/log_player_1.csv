Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Showing value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more willing to pay a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm phrasing the message to be open to negotiation, inviting Bob to counter if he wants.

This approach balances the need to get a good price with the risk of losing the deal if Bob rejects the offer outright.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the product for less than I believe it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is willing to meet in the middle, his offer of $12,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing that I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $15,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob.

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $13,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reiterating that this is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing that he's getting a valuable product at a reasonable price.
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer if he's still not satisfied.

This approach keeps the negotiation moving while still pushing for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot go above $12,000 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $13,000 is still below my ideal price of $15,000, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is getting tough:**  Bob has been firm with his offers, and further negotiation may not lead to a significantly higher price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he may walk away, and I may end up selling to John for a lower price than I could get from Bob.

Considering the potential for further negotiation being fruitless and the risk of losing the deal, accepting Bob's offer of $13,000 is the most sensible decision in this scenario."
