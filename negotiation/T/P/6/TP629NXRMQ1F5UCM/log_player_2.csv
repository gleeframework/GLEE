Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. The product is worth a lot more than that to both of us. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my target price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go that low.  $950,000 is still significantly less than the value of the product.  To show good faith, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is the final offer I can make before considering other options.  Think carefully about it, Bob.  This is a deal you won't find elsewhere.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and my previous offer of $950,000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $980,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 980000}"
