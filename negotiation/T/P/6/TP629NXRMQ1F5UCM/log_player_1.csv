"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my earnings.  I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum target.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price. I'm also confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I have more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. The product is worth a lot more than that to both of us. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to both of us to strengthen my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my target.  However, with only 6 rounds left, the pressure is increasing to close the deal.  I will counteroffer again, but I'll have to be more flexible in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go that low.  $950,000 is still significantly less than the value of the product.  To show good faith, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is the final offer I can make before considering other options.  Think carefully about it, Bob.  This is a deal you won't find elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,000,000, which is my minimum target price. I'm emphasizing the finality of this offer and the limited opportunity to secure this valuable product.  I want to create urgency and nudge Bob towards acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and my previous offer of $950,000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $980,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it is still below my minimum target, and there are only 4 rounds left.  It's risky to keep negotiating with Bob, as I might not be able to secure a higher price within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a good outcome and minimizes the risk of a further decrease in price."
