"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to start by rejecting the initial offer, even if it seems attractive.  This allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  A 25% reduction from Alice's initial price is a significant offer, showing you're serious about negotiating but not being unreasonable.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message clearly states your position and proposed price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The ending leaves the door open for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $900000, and I believe this is still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Let's try $800,000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Bridge the Gap:**  The counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's last price while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  The message reinforces that you're serious about a fair deal but not willing to overpay.
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value keeps Alice aware of its potential, but emphasizes that price is still a key factor."
