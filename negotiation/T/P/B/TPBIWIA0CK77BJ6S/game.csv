,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $750000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $900000, and I believe this is still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  While $900000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Let's try $800000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range.",800000.0,Bob,4,
