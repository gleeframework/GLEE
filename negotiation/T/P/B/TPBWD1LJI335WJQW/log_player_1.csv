Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still below my preferred price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price point by sending him a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $13,500 for the product. It's in top condition and represents a significant value for you.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $13,000 for the product. I'm close to my budget, but I really like the product and think it's worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer.  $13,000 is a good price, and I'd rather sell it to him than take the lower price from John."
