Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 represent potential deals where both you and Bob benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase.
* **Price:**  $1,450,000 gives you a strong profit margin while leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He may counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower. Always remember your bottom line of $1,500,000 from John."
