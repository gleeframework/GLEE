"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product at a price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $1450000. I believe this price is fair considering its worth to you and allows for some room for negotiation.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is unfortunately below what I can accept, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still allows for a good margin for me and leaves room for further discussion. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer! $1300000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference at $1325000. This would give you a great deal, while also allowing me to meet my minimum price. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1300000, but I'd like to add a condition: if you're willing to sell the product for $1300000, I'd like to request a small concession on the warranty. Can we discuss the warranty terms?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
