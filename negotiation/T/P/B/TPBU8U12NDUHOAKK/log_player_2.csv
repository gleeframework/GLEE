"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I buy from her, I'll be paying $9,000, which is more than I'm willing to spend. I'll look for a better deal.
