"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can potentially save $50,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  While Alice might be willing to negotiate, Bob has a strong position as he can walk away and buy from John for $1,000,000.  

By rejecting, Bob initiates a negotiation process that could lead to a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still in a good position.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, and Alice's offer is still above his target price of $850,000.  By rejecting, Bob can try to push Alice further down."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $890,000, which is a compromise from my last offer.  This price is fair considering the value of the product to you and allows me to meet my minimum requirements. Let's close this deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is within Bob's budget and closer to his target price of $850,000.  While there's still a potential to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price makes accepting the offer the most logical choice."
