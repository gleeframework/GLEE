# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which I believe will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still $200,000 more than the product is worth to her. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,300,000. This price still reflects a significant discount from the product's true value, while also acknowledging the value it brings to your business.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  While it's closer to my target, I can still try to negotiate a lower price."

I believe this is a good opportunity for us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering $1,250,000. This price is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth while also being reasonable for you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,250,000. This is still more than I'd like, but it's getting closer to my target.  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk Alice backing out entirely, or I might end up having to pay John's higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product and saves me $250,000 compared to John's price."
