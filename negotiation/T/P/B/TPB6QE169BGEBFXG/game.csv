"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product, recognizing its value to both of us. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,300,000. This price still reflects a significant discount from the product's true value, while also acknowledging the value it brings to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay at this moment. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise, recognizing the product's value while allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. I believe this is a good opportunity for us both to reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering $1,250,000. This price is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth while also being reasonable for you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
