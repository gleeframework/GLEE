"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This allows us both to benefit greatly from this transaction."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Mutually Beneficial Framing:** Emphasizing the mutual benefits of the deal might make Bob more receptive. 
* **Alternative Option:** While I have John as a backup, it's not ideal to settle for his offer immediately. I'll use it strategically if negotiations with Bob don't progress well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to what I could gain. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially since I have the fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but your offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession, But Above Minimum:**  I've made a substantial concession to signal flexibility, but I'm still well above my $1,000,000 floor and closer to the product's actual worth to Bob.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the value proposition again reinforces why a higher price is justified.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By staying firm, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell at any cost, encouraging Bob to move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious about purchasing this product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. I can offer up to $925,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below John's offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than what John is offering. I'll use John's offer as leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $1,000,000 for this product right now. I value our conversation and believe we can still make a deal, but it needs to be closer to that figure. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing John's Offer:** I'm making Bob aware of my alternative without completely walking away from the negotiation. This introduces a sense of urgency and demonstrates that my price floor is real.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting this as my final offer, I'm putting the ball in Bob's court.  This can push him to make a decision quickly and potentially accept a price higher than he initially planned. 
* **Small Concession, Still Profitable:**  I've made a small concession to show flexibility but remain above my minimum and John's offer, ensuring a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the position you're in, and I respect that. However, $1,025,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I can offer a final price of $975,000. This is a fair offer, considering the market value and my own budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has presented his ""final offer,"" which is still below John's standing offer.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer at this point.  

Here's why it's time to switch to John:

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of him dropping out entirely, leaving me with a lower offer than John's. The potential gain from squeezing Bob further is minimal compared to the security of John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Every round spent negotiating with Bob is an opportunity cost. I could be finalizing the deal with John and moving on to other business.
* **Stronger Position:** By walking away from Bob, I demonstrate my confidence and the value of the product. This puts me in a stronger position for future negotiations, should John's deal fall through unexpectedly."
