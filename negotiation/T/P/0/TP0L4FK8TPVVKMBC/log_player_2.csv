Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but your offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its worth to both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $1,000,000 for this product right now. I value our conversation and believe we can still make a deal, but it needs to be closer to that figure. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tricky situation. Alice is playing hardball and introducing another buyer to create pressure. Let's analyze:

* **Alice's Position:** Her 'final offer' suggests she might be getting impatient. However, her willingness to drop to $1,025,000 shows she still wants to make a deal. 
* **Your Position:** You're getting closer to your limit. While John offers a safety net, you can likely get the product cheaper from Alice if you play your cards right.

**Strategy:**

Since we still have rounds to spare, let's push Alice a little further but show that you're serious. 

**Round 5 Decision:**  {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to walk away but are still open to negotiation. This keeps the door open for a potentially better counteroffer from Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the position you're in, and I respect that. However, $1,025,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I can offer a final price of $975,000. This is a fair offer, considering the market value and my own budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  You acknowledge Alice's position but stand firm on your budget.
* **""Final Price"":**  This creates a sense of urgency and signals that you're close to your limit.
* **Justification:** You provide a reason for your offer (""market value and my own budget"") to make it seem more reasonable. 

This counteroffer strikes a balance between standing your ground and still trying to secure a deal with Alice."
