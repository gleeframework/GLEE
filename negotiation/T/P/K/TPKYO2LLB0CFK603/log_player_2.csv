"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the goal is to save money, and you have 10 rounds to negotiate, it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  There's no downside to rejecting the initial offer and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (12.5%) shows Alice you're serious about negotiating.  This also gives you room to compromise in future rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and you're already saving $500 compared to John's price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal without risking further negotiation that could lead to a stalemate or Alice getting more stubborn."
