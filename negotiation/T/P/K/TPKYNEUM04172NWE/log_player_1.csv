Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but we can still try to nudge Bob a little higher.  We're currently $100,000 away from our guaranteed sale with John, and another round of negotiation might bridge that gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with that price. I can do $1,450,000. That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While we're still slightly below John's offer, Bob has drawn a firm line at $1,450,000. It's unlikely we can push him much further without risking the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and avoids the potential for a stalemate."
