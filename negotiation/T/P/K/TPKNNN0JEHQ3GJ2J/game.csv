"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a truly unique opportunity with immense potential. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  I think that's a fair starting point for this negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing the value this product holds for you. This price still allows me to make a decent return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but we're still quite a ways apart. I can go up to $700,000. That's a strong offer, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still not quite on the same page. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, acknowledging your position. This represents a significant compromise on my part.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement before we run out of time.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Do you think we can make this work?",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still below what I consider a fair price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal before time runs out.",800000.0,Alice,7,
