"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you at a very reasonable price. What do you say to $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll choose option 1. Since Alice's offer of $100 is lower than the $120 that John is willing to sell it for, I'll accept her offer.
