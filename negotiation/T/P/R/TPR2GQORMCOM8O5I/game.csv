"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. It's been incredibly valuable to me, but I believe it holds even greater potential in your hands. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. Given your expertise and the product's potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. This would still represent a significant profit for you, while allowing me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand you're looking for a competitive price. While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, the true value of this product goes beyond that. It represents a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will yield substantial returns for you. To meet you closer to the middle ground, I propose a revised price of $1,325,000.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I can see you're serious about this purchase, and I value that. While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,290,000. This is a very competitive offer, considering the unique benefits the product offers.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. $1,290,000 is a good price, but I'm still hoping for a little more wiggle room. I'm willing to go to $1,275,000. This would allow me to acquire the product within my budget, and I'm confident it will still be a profitable transaction for you. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
