"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Alice a chance to counter.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge Alice's willingness to move on price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000 if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Alice moved from her initial offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate. There's still a significant gap between her offer ($900,000) and our target price (under $1,200,000, ideally much lower).
* **Don't Reveal Your Hand:**  Alice is trying to anchor the negotiation around her perceived value of the product to you ($1,200,000). Don't let her dictate the terms. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Continue to make counteroffers, slowly moving towards a more agreeable price, but be prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $800,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Move:**  We're now getting closer to Alice's estimated value of the product ($800,000). This offer puts a bit more pressure on her while still leaving some room for us to negotiate upwards slightly.
* **Maintaining Decisiveness:**  By being clear about our price target, we show Alice that we're serious but still open to a deal.
* **Walk-Away Option:**  We're still below our absolute maximum, so we have the flexibility to walk away if Alice doesn't budge significantly."
