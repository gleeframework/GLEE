"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. ",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is a fair price considering the value I've attached to this product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's the most I'm willing to spend on this product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. However, I'm willing to be flexible and meet you at $9,000, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,5,
