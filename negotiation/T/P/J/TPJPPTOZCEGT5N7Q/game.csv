"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you consider $5,000? I think that would be a fair deal.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  Considering the value this product offers, I'd be willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still give you a good deal, and would be more in line with what I need to receive for it.  Let me know your thoughts!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm trying to keep my budget closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at that price?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500. This price is fair considering the value the product offers you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,5,
