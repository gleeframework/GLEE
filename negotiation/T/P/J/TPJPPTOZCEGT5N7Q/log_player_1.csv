Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By not going too low initially, I can allow for some back-and-forth negotiation and potentially achieve a higher price.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup at $15,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you consider $5,000? I think that would be a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and even below what I believe the product is worth to him. Accepting would result in a huge loss.
* **Potential for counteroffers:** Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, he's still interested in the product. This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **John as a backup:** I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so I can afford to be patient and hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  Considering the value this product offers, I'd be willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still give you a good deal, and would be more in line with what I need to receive for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial $5,000. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, hoping to encourage him to see the value in paying more.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I still have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm trying to keep my budget closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below value:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, $7,000 is still below my target price and significantly less than what I believe the product is worth to him.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob has clearly indicated his willingness to negotiate. We are getting closer to an agreement, but there's still room for me to push for a higher price.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so I can afford to be patient and hold out for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500. This price is fair considering the value the product offers you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm reducing my price further to show flexibility and encourage Bob to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to justify my asking price. 
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""Let's make this happen!"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **John is still a backup:** I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I can still sell to John."
