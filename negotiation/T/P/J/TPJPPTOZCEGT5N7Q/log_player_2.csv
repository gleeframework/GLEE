Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  Considering the value this product offers, I'd be willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still give you a good deal, and would be more in line with what I need to receive for it.  Let me know your thoughts!

Alice's offer:

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower than $8,500, and you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  You've successfully negotiated Alice down, but it's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
