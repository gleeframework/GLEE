Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, Bob values the product significantly higher. My goal is to capture as much of that value as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This gives him a significant incentive to buy while still leaving me with a considerable profit margin.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, I secure a significant profit. If he rejects it, I still have my backup plan with John."
