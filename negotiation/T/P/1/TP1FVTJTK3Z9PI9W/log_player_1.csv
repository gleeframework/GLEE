Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, I want to see if I can get closer to the product's true value to me.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,000 is a significant discount from my guaranteed price, making it an attractive offer for Bob. It leaves room for negotiation but still ensures a profit above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly eliminates the need to find another buyer, which has its own value.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
