"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. I think it's a fair deal considering what you'll gain from it.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price seems a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,500 is closer, but I was hoping for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly interested in the value this product offers. $9,750 is still a significant gap from my bottom line. To be frank, I have another interested buyer, but I'd rather see this go to someone who truly recognizes its value.  How about $10,250?  This is my final offer.",10250.0,Alice,5,
