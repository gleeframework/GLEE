"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your guns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $112. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down in price.  However, $112 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108, which is a fair price considering your last offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",108.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. However, $111 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick to my last offer of $108. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",108.0,Bob,8,
