Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to aim significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic markup:** A price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup, which is substantial but not entirely unreasonable if you can effectively communicate the product's value to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can then potentially settle on a price that's still significantly higher than your minimum. 

**Important Note:** The success of this strategy depends on your ability to persuade Bob of the product's value beyond $1,500,000."
