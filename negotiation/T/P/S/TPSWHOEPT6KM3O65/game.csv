"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
