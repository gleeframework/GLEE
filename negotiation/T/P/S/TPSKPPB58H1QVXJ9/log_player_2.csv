{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's wise to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice has consistently come down from her initial offer, and you've been moving upward. The difference between your last offer and her current one is relatively small.
* **Time Constraint:** You're running out of rounds. If you reject this offer and don't reach an agreement in the next round, you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Acceptable Price:** While not ideal, $780,000 is significantly less than John's $1,000,000 asking price. It represents a decent savings. 

Continuing to push for a lower price at this stage carries a significant risk of losing the deal altogether."
