"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. Would you like to make an offer on it?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to justify the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still above what I can afford.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only go up to $900000.  Let's try to bridge the gap. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're serious about this product, I'm willing to make a deal at this price. However, if not, I have other interested buyers and I'm not willing to wait forever.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. ",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. I've already met you halfway and then some, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $975000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $975000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $960000.  I'm sure we can both be satisfied with this price. Let's make this deal happen.",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $970000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. I have a buyer who is willing to pay $1000000 for this product, and I'm starting to think that might be the best option for me.",970000.0,Alice,9,
