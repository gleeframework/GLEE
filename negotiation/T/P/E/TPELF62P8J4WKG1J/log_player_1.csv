Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but not too far out of range to risk him immediately rejecting the offer.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below the product's worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,500?  That gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500. This is still above my minimum price, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still ensuring I get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for a bit lower.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is a good compromise. While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
