"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $850,000 is tempting, it doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This still provides you with a substantial value and allows me to achieve my goals. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be open to $925,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal. I'll counter with a price that is closer to $1,000,000.  I have some leverage here as I know the product is worth more to Bob than to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $950,000? This price acknowledges the value of the product for you and allows me to make a good profit. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}
