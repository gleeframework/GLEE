"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value, your initial price is significantly higher than I'm prepared to pay. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this.  While I understand your initial offer, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your price, but it's still a big leap from my initial offer.  To be realistic, I can't go higher than $1,000,000 at this point.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal.  While $1,000,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to consider offers in that range.  To meet you halfway, how about we settle on $1,300,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
