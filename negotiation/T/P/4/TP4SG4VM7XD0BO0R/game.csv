"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I'm sure will be a great addition to your business. I believe this price is fair considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm proposing $1,300,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $1,250,000 still doesn't reflect the full value of this product to you.  Let's be realistic.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise and a good opportunity for us to close this deal. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me.  However, $1,350,000 is still slightly out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair and mutually beneficial price.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
