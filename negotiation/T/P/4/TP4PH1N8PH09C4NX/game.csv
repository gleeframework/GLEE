"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $700000. I'm willing to compromise, though.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $795000? I think this is the best compromise we can reach. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go below $795000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $790000. Take it or leave it.",790000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're willing to make one last offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $790000. I'm willing to meet you at $775000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options.",775000.0,Bob,8,
