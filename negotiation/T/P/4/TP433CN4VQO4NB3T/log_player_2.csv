Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It also acknowledges Alice's value for the product.  We'll see how she responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is getting close to your upper limit of $1,000,000. It is now more advantageous to accept her offer and secure the product rather than risk a further counteroffer that might lead to a deal breaking or being forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good compromise that balances potential savings with the risk of losing the opportunity."
