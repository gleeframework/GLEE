Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for a price of $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can use that as your safety net. Offering the product to Bob at a significantly higher price ($15,000) allows you to test his willingness to pay a premium. 

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts your offer, and you make a $5,000 profit over your minimum.
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects your offer, and you sell it to John for your guaranteed $10,000. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while minimizing risk."
