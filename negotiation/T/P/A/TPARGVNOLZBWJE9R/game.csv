"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'm willing to go slightly above that, to $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
