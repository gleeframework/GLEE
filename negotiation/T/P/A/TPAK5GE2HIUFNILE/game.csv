"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! The product looks great, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. $9,200 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Could you do $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $8,500, which would be $8,850. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",8850.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,850 is close, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Would you consider $8,600?",8600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to a tight budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8750.0,Alice,7,
