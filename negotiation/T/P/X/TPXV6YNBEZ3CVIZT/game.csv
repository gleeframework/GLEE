"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product is valuable, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
