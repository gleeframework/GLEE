Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. This can make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice. Bob might counter-offer, but the starting point makes it more likely the final price will be above Alice's minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value to Bob specifically (""someone with your expertise""), making the higher price seem more justifiable. 
* **Backup Option:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has the security of John's offer at $800,000."
