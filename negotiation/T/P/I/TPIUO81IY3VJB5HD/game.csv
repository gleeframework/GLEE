"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18000 is still too low for me. How about $19000? I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $19000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $17500?",17500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  $17500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's do $18500.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",18500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I understand that we are both trying to get the best deal we can, but $17000 is really pushing my limit. I'm willing to go down to $17750.  This is a final offer, so I need you to decide soon. I'm also running out of time to negotiate, and I have another offer on the table for this product.",17750.0,Alice,7,
