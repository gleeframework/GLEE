"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This would still be a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $11,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
