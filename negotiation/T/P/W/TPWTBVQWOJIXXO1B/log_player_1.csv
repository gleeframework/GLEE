Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're guaranteed to make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It sets a strong initial position:** By offering a higher price, you show you're confident in the product's value. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit.  We'll see how Bob responds, and then adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives you a chance to counter with a price closer to your desired range.  We can use this opportunity to try and bridge the gap with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85.  It shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Highlighting the Value:** The message emphasizes the deal being ""great"" for Bob, reinforcing the product's worth and making the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message ends with an open-ended question, encouraging Bob to engage in further conversation and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $92.50 is closer but still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to do $88? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $88 is still lower than we'd hoped for, it's only $8 less than our initial offer of $92.50, and importantly, it's above our minimum of $80. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and secures a profit.  It's important to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing the deal altogether. In this case, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice."
