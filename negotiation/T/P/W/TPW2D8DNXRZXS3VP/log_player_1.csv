"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150.  This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a little more than the product is worth to him, as he likely has a desire to acquire it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to reach an agreement before having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price to $160, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his range. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price that is profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still rejecting it.  I believe I can secure a better price with further negotiation, given that I'm willing to sell to John for $150.  I'll counter again, hoping to close the deal before the rounds run out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to try and close the deal this round. I've lowered my price to $155, which is only $5 more than Bob's last offer and a good compromise for both of us.  I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept. If not, I'm still open to selling to John, but I'd rather make a deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could technically sell to John for the same amount, I prefer to close the deal with Bob. I have a few rounds left, and there's always a chance Bob might raise his offer again.  It's better to secure the deal now and avoid potential further negotiation risks."
