"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again. How about $14000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $15500? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",15500.0,Alice,5,
