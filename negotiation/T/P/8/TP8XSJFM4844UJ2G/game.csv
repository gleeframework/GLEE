"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,075,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
