"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your position, $1,025,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,037,500. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
