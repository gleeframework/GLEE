"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it, given my budget and its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this price reflects the value this product brings while acknowledging your interest.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $850,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value we both see in this product. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,4,
