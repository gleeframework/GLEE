"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, even more so than the initial price tag might suggest. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. To start, I propose a price of $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $1,500,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
