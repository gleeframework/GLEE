Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

Alice is now matching John's price, and there's no benefit to continuing negotiations.  It's best to accept the deal now."
