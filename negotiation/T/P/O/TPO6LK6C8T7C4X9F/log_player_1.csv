Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and even your minimum ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value and other potential interest, you create a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects $20,000, you can adjust down towards your minimum while still likely exceeding his $8,000 valuation.

**Important Note:**  You have a strong fallback position with John ($15,000 guaranteed). This allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob."
