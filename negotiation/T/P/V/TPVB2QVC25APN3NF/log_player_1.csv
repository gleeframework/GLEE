Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $13,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, starting the negotiation with a higher price ($13,500) leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Counter:** This offer might encourage Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than his initial valuation but still profitable for you.
* **Safety Net of John:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we know John will purchase the product for our minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring we don't lose out."
