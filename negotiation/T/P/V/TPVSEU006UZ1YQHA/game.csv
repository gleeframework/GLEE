"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you receive from the product. Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to pay $900,000. I'd be willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between $850,000 and $900,000.",825000.0,Bob,6,
