"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired value.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly and open tone to build rapport with Bob. This can encourage him to be more open to negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product by suggesting it's a ""great deal"" for both of us.

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point. I'll need to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. How about considering $1800000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than my absolute minimum ($1,500,000), it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and my desired value.  
* **Negotiation is Key:** I believe I can still get a better price through negotiation, so I'm not going to accept his offer immediately. 
* **Room for Counteroffer:** Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Close to Initial:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to my initial offer of $2,000,000 but still higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasize Value Again:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my asking price.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  I'm expressing a desire to reach an agreement with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he's still not willing to come up, I'll need to decide whether to keep negotiating or consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I would like to propose a price of $1750000 for the product. This would allow us to reach a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not high enough.  I'm determined to get a better price.
* **More Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm considering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer to see if I can entice him. However, I'll need to carefully weigh the risk of Bob rejecting my offer again.  If he does, I'll have to make a critical decision about whether to keep negotiating or accept the $1,500,000 offer from John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest.  I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This is a fair price, and it's closer to your offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,900,000) and Bob's offer ($1,750,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully incentivizes Bob to accept.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as ""fair,"" suggesting that it's a good deal for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob and encourage him to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he accepts, I've reached a deal. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or consider selling to John. I'm getting close to the halfway point of our negotiations, so each decision becomes more critical."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $1780000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below My Goal:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,800,000 at this point.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price with another counteroffer.  

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer in the next round. Since we're getting close to the end of our allotted rounds, I'll need to be strategic. I'll aim for a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but I'll also keep in mind the risk of him rejecting it again and the potential of selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my last offer.  I'm willing to go down to $1,820,000, but this is my final counteroffer.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1820000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This counteroffer signals that I'm getting closer to my limit.  I'm offering a price that's only $40,000 less than my previous offer, making it more tempting for Bob to accept.
* **Emphasis on Finality:**  The phrase ""final counteroffer"" adds urgency to the situation and emphasizes that I'm not willing to negotiate further if Bob rejects it. 
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm trying to appeal to Bob's desire to reach an agreement by suggesting that we find ""common ground."" 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I have two rounds left.  I'll need to analyze the situation carefully and decide whether to counteroffer again or sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000.  The potential for a better deal with Bob will need to be weighed against the risk of losing time and potentially ending up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence in finding a fair price. I would like to counter with a final offer of $1795000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a reasonable compromise and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** While Bob's offer is the closest he's come to my target price, it's still $5,000 less than what I'd ideally like to get. 
* **Two Rounds Left:** With only two rounds remaining, I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal. There's a chance Bob might be willing to move up just a bit more, especially since he's also emphasized that this is his ""final offer.""

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make one final counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price just above Bob's offer, but I'll need to carefully consider the risk of him rejecting it and leaving me with only one round to sell to John. If Bob rejects, I'll have to weigh the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John against the possibility of a slightly higher price with Bob in the final round."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer.  While it's tempting, I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the true value of the product.  I'm willing to come up to $1,800,000, but this is my absolute final offer. If we can't reach an agreement here, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This counteroffer signals that I'm at my limit. I'm offering a price that's only $5,000 higher than Bob's final offer, making it more tempting for him to accept.
* **Emphasis on Finality:** The phrase ""absolute final offer"" adds urgency and emphasizes that I'm not willing to negotiate further.
* **Exploring Other Options:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob that I have a backup plan (John) and that I'm not desperate for a deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I have one round left. I'll have to make a critical decision: accept John's offer of $1,500,000 or risk getting nothing by holding out for a higher price from Bob. This is a high-stakes situation, and I'll need to weigh the guaranteed money against the possibility of a slightly better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your patience and understanding throughout this process. I would like to extend one last offer of $1775000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of the product while also being mindful of my budget constraints. I hope this final offer will lead to a successful conclusion of our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Last Round:** This is the final round of negotiations. 
* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's final offer of $1,775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,800,000. 
* **Guaranteed Money:** With no more room for negotiation, it's more advantageous for me to accept the guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's better than risking getting nothing from Bob. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the fact that I have no further negotiation opportunities. If I had more rounds, I might be willing to take a risk and hold out for a better offer from Bob.  However, with only one round left, it's more prudent to secure a guaranteed sale."
