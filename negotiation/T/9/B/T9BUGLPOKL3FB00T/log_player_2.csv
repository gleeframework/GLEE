"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to your budget.  You can always buy from John later if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation. It also expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to your budget, $10,500 is still significantly more than your $8,000 alternative with John. There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? "",

}
```

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your ideal budget.  It also maintains a polite and respectful tone in the negotiation."
