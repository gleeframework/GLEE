"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? ",9750.0,Bob,4,
