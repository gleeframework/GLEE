Bob's offer:

I'm going to try to get a better price. Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'll counteroffer to see if there's any room for negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1300000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.

Bob's offer is close to my minimum and it's unlikely I'll get a better price from him.  It's better to accept his offer than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the minimum."
