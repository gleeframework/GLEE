"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product that's truly one-of-a-kind. I'm asking for $1500000 for it.  It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it holds will far exceed that. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1300000. This reflects the unique value of this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1300000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
