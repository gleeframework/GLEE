"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $12,000.  The product is only worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is a little more than Alice's value, but it leaves some room for her to negotiate. If she rejects, you can always increase your offer slightly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is a little higher than before, but you can still try to get a better price. Rejecting the offer will allow you to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

You're increasing your offer slightly, but it's still below Alice's offer.  This shows that you're serious about getting the product, but you're still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum price, but it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation. It's better to buy from John and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting your next counteroffer and potentially raising her price even higher."
