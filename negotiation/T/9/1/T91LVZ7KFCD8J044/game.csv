"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,000,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  thank you for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, $2,000,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm willing to go to $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  If this works for you, we can close the deal now.  If not, I'll need to look elsewhere.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
