"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  thank you for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, $2,000,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

We're getting closer to my baseline, but I'm willing to hold out a bit longer to try and secure a better deal.  We still have room to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm willing to go to $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  If this works for you, we can close the deal now.  If not, I'll need to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob has met my baseline price, and there's no guarantee I can get a better offer from him. It's time to close the deal."
