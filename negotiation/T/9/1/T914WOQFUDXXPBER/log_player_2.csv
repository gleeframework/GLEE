"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still higher than his maximum, but significantly lower than Alice's offer.  This gives him some room to negotiate and shows Alice he's serious about getting a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90?  That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his desired price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate further and potentially get closer to his $80 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $90 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $87.50.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a middle ground price, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  This strategy aims to get closer to his target price without pushing Alice too far."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $89. This is the best I can do, and it's still a good value for you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $89, which is only $9 less than Bob's maximum.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, Bob has already used 4 rounds and has only 6 remaining. It's risky to keep negotiating, as Alice might not budge further. Buying from John guarantees a price within Bob's budget and allows him to avoid the risk of further negotiation."
