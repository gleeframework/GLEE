Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing it as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to counteroffers, but I have a backup buyer (John) in case negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to earn. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob acknowledged the value of the product. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed $120 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Empathy:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good price while emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Focus on the deal:** I'm reframing the offer as a good deal for Bob to increase the chances of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not ideal:**  While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum of $120, it's still not a price I'm completely happy with.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again, he might walk away entirely. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John at $120 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob. 

Given the circumstances, selling to John is the most sensible option to secure a satisfactory profit."
