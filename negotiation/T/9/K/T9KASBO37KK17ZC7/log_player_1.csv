Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $200 for it."",
""product_price"": 200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) and my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $200, I am prepared to go lower if Bob counters, but I'm still aiming for a price that is profitable for me.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I am aware that I have another buyer (John) willing to pay $150. This gives me a strong fallback option if Bob's offer is too low.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to negotiate with Bob while being mindful of my minimum price and the offer from John. If Bob's counteroffers don't meet my needs, I'm willing to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $150 matches my minimum acceptable price, but I know John is also willing to pay that amount. There's no point in further negotiation with Bob since I'm guaranteed to get $150 from John. Selling to John avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in future rounds."
