"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You're willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000.
* Alice's offer is $1,400,000, which is still within your budget.
* However, you can get the product from John for $1,500,000. This means that rejecting Alice's offer will allow you to buy the product from John for a price that is closer to Alice's value.

**Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will save you more money in the long run.**"
