"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's a game-changer in its field and has been designed to meet your specific needs perfectly. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its true worth of $10,000 to you, I'm offering it to you today for $9,500. This is a special opportunity to secure such an asset at a price that's still significantly higher than what others might pay for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further with Alice or move on to John as a backup."
