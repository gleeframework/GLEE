"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $135, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $130, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. I think we're getting close to a deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's meet at $122.50. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",122.5,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $120, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to accept that price?",120.0,Bob,8,
