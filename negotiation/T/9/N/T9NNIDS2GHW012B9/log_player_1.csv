Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

**Strategy:**

Offering the product at $115 aims to maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob. This price gives Bob a small gain compared to his valuation while giving you almost the maximum possible profit."
