"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's work together to find a solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1000000 is still slightly above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while staying within my price range. Let's finalize this transaction and make it happen.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $925000 is still below my acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $975000, but this is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",975000.0,Alice,5,
