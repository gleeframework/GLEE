"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $900000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for either of us. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and allows me to achieve my desired return. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's close this deal now.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
