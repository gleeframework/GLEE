"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for either of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and allows me to achieve my desired return. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same as what I would get from John. There's no point in risking a further rejection from Bob and potentially losing out on both deals.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick and secure sale."
