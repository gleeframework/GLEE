"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save money, and $1,200,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $1,000,000. It makes more sense to reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $900000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for either of us. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and allows me to achieve my desired return. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer, it's not worth accepting yet. Bob can likely negotiate further and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
