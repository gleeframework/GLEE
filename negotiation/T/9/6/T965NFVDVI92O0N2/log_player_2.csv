Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground.

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price, potentially getting closer to his ideal price point."
