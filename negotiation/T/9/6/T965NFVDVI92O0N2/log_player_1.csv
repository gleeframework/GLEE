{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it gives me a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise between your desired price of $1,500,000 and Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This should give Bob a good deal while still allowing you to earn a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that allows you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than the price I'm willing to accept to keep the negotiation going.  I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This would allow us both to reach a compromise and move forward with the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable amount. It's also a good middle ground between our positions, and  I want to avoid losing the deal altogether. I'll accept Bob's offer."
