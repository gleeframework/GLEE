"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I have to consider the value of the product and the time and effort that went into acquiring it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. If we can't reach a deal at that price, I'll have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm now offering the product to you for $10,750. This is as low as I can go.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250, which is a good compromise. If we can't find a deal at that price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it seriously.",10500.0,Alice,7,
