"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's work together to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
