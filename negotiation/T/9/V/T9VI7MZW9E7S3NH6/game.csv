"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $15,000 is still a bit much for me. How about we settle at $12,000?  That's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
