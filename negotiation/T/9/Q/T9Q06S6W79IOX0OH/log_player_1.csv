Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to what I want and is much better than selling to John for $800,000. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
