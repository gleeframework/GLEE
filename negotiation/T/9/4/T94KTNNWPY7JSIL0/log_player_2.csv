"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $135.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in further negotiations."
