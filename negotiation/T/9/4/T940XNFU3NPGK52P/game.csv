"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $88. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. ",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $88, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $90.  How about we settle at $89? That's a small compromise on both sides and lets us make a deal.  What do you say?",89.0,Alice,5,
