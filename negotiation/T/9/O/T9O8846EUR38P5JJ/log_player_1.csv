"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $16,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $16,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  This is my maximum price, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price of $12,000. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation."
