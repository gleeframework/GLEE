"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $16,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $16,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  This is my maximum price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
