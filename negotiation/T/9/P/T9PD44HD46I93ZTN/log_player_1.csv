``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives him some room to negotiate.  This strategy aims to find a price that both parties are happy with, while also keeping my options open to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,800 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm holding out for a price closer to $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise at $9,200. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 9200} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $9200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been going back and forth for a while, and it's clear that we're unlikely to get much closer. While $9,000 is not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. It's important to be flexible during negotiations and recognize when a good compromise is in sight."
