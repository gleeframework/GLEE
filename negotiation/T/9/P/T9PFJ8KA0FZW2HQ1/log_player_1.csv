"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling the product for $1600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,600,000, so I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1650000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is closer to my desired range and better than selling to John for $1,200,000. It's worth securing the deal now."
