"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay $120 to Alice."
