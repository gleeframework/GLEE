"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room for negotiation. I also want to establish the value of the product in his mind before we start bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I'm already in round 2."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $950,000 is getting close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but I'm still committed to getting a fair value for my product.  Let's meet halfway again, at $1,000,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with your purchase. "", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, the time is running out. We're at round 6, and I'm not confident that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price before the 10 rounds are over.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe and guaranteed option, and it aligns with my minimum acceptable price."
