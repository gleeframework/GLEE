"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know it would be incredibly valuable to your business.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential impact on your business. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair price for both of us and a significant step closer to a deal. Let's try to close this.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to finalize this deal, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $1,140,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1140000.0,Alice,5,
