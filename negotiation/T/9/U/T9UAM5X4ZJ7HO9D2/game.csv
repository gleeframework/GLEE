"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and opens the door for a beneficial partnership.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value, $2,300,000 is quite high. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product significantly exceeds $900,000. Let's find a middle ground - would you consider $1,900,000? I believe this price reflects the product's unique qualities while still providing substantial value for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, we're still pretty far apart on this.  To be frank, anything much above $1,000,000 isn't going to make sense for me. I could consider $1,100,000 if that would get us closer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,600,000?  This acknowledges the true value of the product while still offering you a significant gain.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. To move this forward, I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I think it's fair considering the potential we both see.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  I'm also invested in seeing this deal go through. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,450,000.  This reflects my bottom line and ensures a win-win situation for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, your commitment to finding a solution is appreciated.  $1,450,000 is still a bit more than I'd hoped, but I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,250,000. Let's get this done.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
