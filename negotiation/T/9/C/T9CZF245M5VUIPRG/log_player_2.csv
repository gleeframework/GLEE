"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly enhance your daily life. Given its value and quality, I'm confident it's worth more than what you're currently considering. However, I understand budgets and preferences vary. I'm offering this exceptional item to you for $120, a price that reflects its true worth while offering you a great deal. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's message is persuasive, $120 is still significantly more than your $80 budget and what John is offering. You have a better alternative available."
