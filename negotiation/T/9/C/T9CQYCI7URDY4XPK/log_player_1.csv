Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,500. This price is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair starting point that allows for both of us to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I am countering Bob's offer with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price point.  I hope this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. Although I'm willing to negotiate, I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for a price that meets my minimum requirements. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000."
