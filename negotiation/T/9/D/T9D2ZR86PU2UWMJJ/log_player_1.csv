"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to leverage the fact that the product is worth more to me than to Bob.  I'll see if he's willing to negotiate up from his initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to sell yet.  I'll counter and see if we can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than what John is willing to pay, and we're already at round 4. There's a good chance that the next few rounds will be more time-consuming and could result in a lower offer from Bob.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
