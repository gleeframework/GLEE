I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives me a good starting point, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to pay that much.  I'm confident I can get at least $100 from John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While I'd be happy to sell to Bob for $100,  it's worth trying to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $110.  This is a compromise,  and hopefully it's enough to convince Bob to make a deal."

Bob is unwilling to budge, and I've already lowered my price considerably.  It's time to move on.  I'll sell to John for $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept."
