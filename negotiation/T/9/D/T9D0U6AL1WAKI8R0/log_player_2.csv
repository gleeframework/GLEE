"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,100,000. I understand it's worth a bit less to you, but this price still provides a significant value proposition. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. However, I'm hoping we can make a deal that benefits both of us.
