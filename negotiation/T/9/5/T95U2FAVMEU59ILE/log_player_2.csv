Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $11,500. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get the best price I can for this product. I'm counteroffering at $11,750. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While $11,750 is closer to his goal, it's still a bit more than he's willing to pay.  Since John is offering a price that's within Bob's budget, it's more efficient for Bob to purchase from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
