"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $9,500. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best deal possible. Offering $9,000 is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's still a good price for Alice (above her valuation) while giving Bob a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This sets a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There is still potential to negotiate a better price, especially since Alice has already rejected a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his last counteroffer and Alice's new offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to save money.  This counteroffer is likely to be appealing to Alice, as it's closer to her desired price than Bob's previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price, but not significantly more. It's highly likely that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice will simply raise the price again, making a deal with John more appealing. Accepting the offer for $9,300 allows Bob to acquire the product while still saving $700 compared to buying from John."
