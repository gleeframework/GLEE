"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?  I think that's a fair offer reflecting its worth to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle on $1,175,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
