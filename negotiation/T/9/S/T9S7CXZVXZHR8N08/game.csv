"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  Would you consider $500,000? I think that would be a fair price.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer of $500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still working within a tight budget. Could we settle on $600,000? That's a firm offer on my end.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $600,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $650,000. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $625,000?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $625,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $675,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",675000.0,Alice,7,
