"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will greatly benefit your business.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product will bring to your business, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done.

There's still room to bring the price down. You can make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a final agreement within your budget."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the negotiations dragging on. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is getting very close to your target price. It's possible to continue negotiating, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal, and you'll have to buy from John at a much higher price.  

Given that you've only got 3 rounds left, accepting this offer is the most prudent decision. You'll save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and you'll still be within your budget."
