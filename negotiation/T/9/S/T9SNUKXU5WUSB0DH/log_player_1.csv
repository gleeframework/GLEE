Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth your consideration.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,100,000 is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product without being overly aggressive.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a slightly lower price than my minimum acceptable value, I aim to:

*  **Encourage Bob's interest:** Making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, I have space to adjust my price without dropping below my minimum.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** I can still walk away and sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I am willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a more favorable deal. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Continue negotiation:**  I can use the counteroffer to explore a price closer to my minimum while still keeping Bob engaged.
* **Assess Bob's seriousness:** By seeing how far he's willing to go, I can gauge his commitment to buying the product.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** I haven't lost my backup option and can still sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work. How about $1,075,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $1,075,000 is a compromise, bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the value of the product.  I'm presenting this offer as a ""fair compromise,"" making it more appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's price:** By lowering my price, I demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining my value:** The price is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Keeping the negotiation alive:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, increasing the chance of reaching a mutually acceptable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1060000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting this offer is a good compromise. 

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the deal:**  This offer is within my acceptable range, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly higher price.
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether, potentially leaving me with only John as an option.
* **Time and effort:** Accepting this offer minimizes the time and effort required to negotiate further, which is valuable. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale close to my minimum acceptable price and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
