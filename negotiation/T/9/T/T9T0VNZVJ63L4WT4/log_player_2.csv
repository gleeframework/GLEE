"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than $13,000, so accepting Alice's offer is not the best option.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Alice a reason to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum price of $15,000 and above Alice's minimum price of $8,000. Accepting this offer saves Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and him having to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
