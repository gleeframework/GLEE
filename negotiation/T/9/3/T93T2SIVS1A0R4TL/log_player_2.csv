"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1450000. It's a great deal for you, as you've mentioned this product is worth $1200000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to secure the product from John at the lower price."
