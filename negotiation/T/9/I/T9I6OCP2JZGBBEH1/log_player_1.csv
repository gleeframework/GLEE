{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. Bob is likely to counteroffer, but this allows me to gauge his interest and potentially secure a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is still a decent profit, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves you a substantial profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000.  That's a good middle ground, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than selling to John and still leaves me with a good profit. I'm willing to accept this offer to finalize the deal."
