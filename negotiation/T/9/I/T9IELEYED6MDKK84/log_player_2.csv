Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90.  It's a great price for a great product. What do you say?

You can still get a better price. The product is worth $100 to you and $80 to Alice.  You should aim for a price closer to $85."
