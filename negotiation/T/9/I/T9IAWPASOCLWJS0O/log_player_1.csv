Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a good margin while still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is interested in paying a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $14,000 is better than selling to John, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob is sticking to $14,000, and while I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, $14,000 is still a good deal. It's better than selling to John for $12,000, and there's no guarantee that I could get a better price in future rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer."
