"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its exceptional features and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true value and provides a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but that initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the $600,000 mark doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential this product holds.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $950,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground. I want to make this work and feel we're getting closer. To be transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $875,000.  This accounts for its true worth and the value it brings. If you're able to meet me at this point, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
