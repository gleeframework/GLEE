"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its exceptional features and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true value and provides a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's ""unique"" features and ""exceptional"" potential aims to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's perception of its value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Using phrases like ""initial proposal"" and ""fair starting point"" signals your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Set a high reference point for Bob.
2. **Gauge:** Understand Bob's willingness to pay and negotiation style. 
3. **Leave room:**  For potential counteroffers and a path to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but that initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for you. 

While his offer is far off, it gives you some information to work with.  You now know he's interested but perceives a much lower value than your target.  It's too early to sell to John, as you have room to negotiate and potentially bridge the gap with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the $600,000 mark doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential this product holds.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $950,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Appreciate:** Recognizing Bob's counter-offer and showing appreciation for his engagement fosters a positive negotiation environment.
* **Explain the Gap:** Instead of simply dismissing his offer, you're highlighting that it doesn't align with the product's inherent value.
* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** A drop from $1,100,000 to $950,000 is substantial, demonstrating your willingness to find common ground, but it keeps you well above both his offer and your minimum. 
* **Framing as ""Compromise"":** This positions the new price not as a fixed demand but a step towards a mutually agreeable solution.

This approach:

1. **Maintains Value:** You're not drastically undervaluing the product.
2. **Encourages Reciprocity:** A significant concession on your part may encourage Bob to make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round. 
3. **Keeps John as Backup:** You're still in a strong position to walk away if negotiations fail and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now moving closer to your range, but $775,000 is still significantly under your $1,200,000 minimum. It seems like he's aiming for the midpoint between offers each round, which isn't a bad negotiating tactic on his part.

You have some leverage:

* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed $1,200,000 backup.
* **Rounds Remaining:**  You still have several rounds to try and bring Bob closer to your acceptable range.

It's worth making another counter-offer to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground. I want to make this work and feel we're getting closer. To be transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $875,000.  This accounts for its true worth and the value it brings. If you're able to meet me at this point, I'm ready to finalize the deal."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Firmness:** By revealing your minimum price, you're setting a clear boundary and emphasizing the seriousness of your position. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's ""true worth"" reinforces its value proposition, aiming to shift Bob's focus away from simply splitting the difference.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Phrases like ""ready to finalize"" introduce a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision. 

This approach:

1. **Tests Bob's Limit:** By presenting your bottom line, you'll quickly gauge his willingness to stretch his budget.
2. **Controls the Negotiation:** You're shifting from reacting to his offers to setting the terms.
3. **Maintains Walk-Away Option:** If Bob refuses to meet your minimum, you can still accept John's offer."
