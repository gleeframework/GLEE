"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than Alice's valuation and leaves room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and open the door for a counter-offer."
