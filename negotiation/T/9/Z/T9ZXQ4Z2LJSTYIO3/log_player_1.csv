"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. It's a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise.  I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept as it's closer to my desired price, I'm going to stick to my minimum and see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer is above my minimum price of $15,000 and is also very close to the price I offered in the previous round.  It's important to remember that I have 10 rounds to close the deal, and if I don't reach an agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000.  Accepting this offer will allow me to close the deal quickly and still get a decent price."
