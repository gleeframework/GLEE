"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to make it yours for $14000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows for more negotiation rounds and the potential for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:**  $13,500 is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer, and it's significantly lower than John's price. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might not be worth the risk:** There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and Bob is already saving $1,500 compared to John.  The risk of going another round is that Alice might increase the price or refuse to negotiate further, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John. 
* **Time pressure:**  Bob has a limited number of rounds to make a deal. Accepting this offer ensures a good price while leaving some room for future negotiation if needed."
