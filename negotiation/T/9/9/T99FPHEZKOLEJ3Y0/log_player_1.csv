"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and market value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""features and market value,"" I'm subtly anchoring the price to a higher perceived worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""initially proposing"" signals my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. His message indicates he values the product (""I really like the product"") but is using budget as a negotiation tactic. I'll counter with a price closer to his, but still above my minimum, to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price exactly halfway between our previous offers, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a fair deal.
* **Above Minimum:** This price point is still comfortably above my minimum, maximizing potential profit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Bob's response will reveal if he's truly budget-constrained or simply looking for the best possible deal. If he rejects this, I'll need to consider moving closer to my minimum or potentially selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $15,000. How about we try $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $15,000 but has shown a willingness to move slightly upward. Accepting his offer of $16,000 represents a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of him walking away or further drawn-out negotiations."
