"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You're aiming for a price closer to $80, and have several rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. You're offering a price that's closer to your target of $80 while also showing Alice that you're serious about buying. This gives Alice room to counteroffer if she wants, but also shows you're willing to move towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $95, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but you still have room to negotiate. You can try to squeeze out a bit more savings in the next round. There's no need to rush into buying the product, especially since you have the option of purchasing it from John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. How about $92?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a deal, and this offer shows you're serious about closing.  $92 is a good compromise point, and it's still within your budget. By highlighting that it's a fair price for both, you're appealing to Alice's sense of reason and encouraging her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to my minimum, Bob. I can do $97, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $97 is very close to your target price of $80 and is still within your budget of $120.  While there's a chance you could negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John is increasing. It's a good deal for both parties and  a safe bet to accept, securing the product without significantly exceeding your budget."
