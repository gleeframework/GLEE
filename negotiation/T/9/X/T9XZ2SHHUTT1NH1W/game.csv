"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $85.  If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll have to consider other options.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can offer you a compromise at $95. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",95.0,Alice,5,
