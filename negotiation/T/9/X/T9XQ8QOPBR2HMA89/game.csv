"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about $1,350,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to your business.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,300,000? That's the highest I can go for this product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
