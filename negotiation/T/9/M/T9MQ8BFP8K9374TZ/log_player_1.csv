Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than that to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking for a price closer to $12000. Can we negotiate down from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer is at the minimum acceptable price for me, I'm still willing to try and get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to try and counter-offer him before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is really the absolute minimum I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more to $12,500, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking for a price closer to $12000. I would like to propose $12200 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,200 is only $200 less than my counteroffer of $12,500. I'm willing to accept this offer as it's still within a reasonable range and I want to avoid potentially losing out on the deal by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
