"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting with a slightly inflated price, hoping to leverage my perceived value of the product. It's also a good starting point for negotiation.  I'll see what Bob's response is and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm sticking with a price higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his value. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway.  We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still confident I can get a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11800} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a bit more. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also maintaining my desired price.  We are nearing the end of the negotiation, so I need to find a sweet spot where we can both agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call, as Bob's offer is only $200 below my minimum acceptable value. However, we are already in round 6 and I'm not sure if I can secure a better price.  It's too risky to continue negotiating, as John is a guaranteed sale for my desired price. I'll choose to sell the product to John."
