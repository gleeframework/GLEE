"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I'm still unable to meet at $11,000. I believe $9,500 would be a fair compromise for both of us. I hope this offer aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,4,
