{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it's worth every penny! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer sets a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value ($150) but still above my minimum threshold ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer, while also maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum threshold, it's still below my desired price point.  I believe I can still get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go that low.  How about $135? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go that high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $132.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is close to my desired price point and a good compromise.  Accepting it will allow me to maximize my profits, as selling to John would only yield $120."
