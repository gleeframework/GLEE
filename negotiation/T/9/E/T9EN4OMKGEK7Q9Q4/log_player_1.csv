Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me.  This is a common tactic in negotiations to see if Bob is willing to pay more than the product is worth to him.  I'm also leaving room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm not willing to accept that price. I will try to counteroffer to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. This should hopefully bridge the gap between our current offers and show Bob that I am willing to negotiate but won't settle for a price too far below what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering again at $85. This is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  At this point, I'm hoping to find a middle ground and come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, the negotiations are dragging on, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $100 from John than risk further haggling with Bob."
