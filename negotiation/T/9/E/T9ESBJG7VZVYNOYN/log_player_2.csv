"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. You should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $110."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but leaves room for further negotiation. It also signals that you're serious about buying but need a more reasonable price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $200 represents my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $170 to find a fair deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above your budget and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** You're acknowledging Alice's move towards a compromise.
* **Stays within your budget:** The offer is still under your $150 limit.
* **Provides a potential win-win:** It's a price that might be tempting for Alice while still saving you money compared to John's offer."
