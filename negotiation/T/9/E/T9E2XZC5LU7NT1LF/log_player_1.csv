Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and provides significant benefit to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 allows for some back and forth if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **High Anchor:** This initial price sets a high anchor, making a counteroffer around $1,100,000 more palatable and still very profitable.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position and leverage in the negotiation."
