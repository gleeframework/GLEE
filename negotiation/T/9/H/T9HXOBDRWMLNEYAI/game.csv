"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a deal for $105. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I really appreciate it. However, I'm still a bit over budget at $105. How about we split the difference and I pay $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can make the purchase today.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a deal for $102. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
