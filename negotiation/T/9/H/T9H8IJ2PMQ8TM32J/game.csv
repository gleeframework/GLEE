,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. How about we meet in the middle? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $14,000. It's a fair price, considering the value this product can bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering my budget constraints.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I can offer you a slight concession at $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I understand you're firm on the value, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $11,500? It's a strong offer, and I'm hopeful we can make a deal. ",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $12,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",12500.0,Alice,7,
