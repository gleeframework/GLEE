"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the product's ""unique features and potential"" subtly reinforces its value, even if the mentioned price is above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  Phrases like ""What are your thoughts?"" invite Bob to participate in the negotiation rather than shutting down the conversation.

By starting high, we aim to:

1. **Understand Bob's position:**  His reaction will reveal how far apart our valuations are. 
2. **Potentially secure a favorable deal:** There's always a chance Bob might accept a higher price.
3. **Establish a strong negotiating position:** Starting high gives us more room to concede during subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly higher than our guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal.  We'll aim to counter in a way that brings Bob closer to our target range without accepting an immediate loss."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob.  To be frank, $2,000,000 is my ideal target, but I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement. Considering your budget, how about we meet halfway at $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** We start by acknowledging Bob's offer and perspective to maintain a positive negotiating environment.
* **Revealing Flexibility (Slightly):** Mentioning the ideal target price while expressing flexibility can encourage Bob to negotiate further.
* **Meeting Halfway (Strategic):**  Proposing $1,800,000 makes it seem like a compromise, even though it's still significantly above our walk-away point. This keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining a strong position. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Bob's reaction to this counteroffer will give us further insight into his willingness to move towards our desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we discuss $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress, but $1,700,000 is still not acceptable. We are getting closer to our limit (John's offer), and Bob seems to be willing to negotiate. We will try to push a little further but need to be careful not to push Bob away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,700,000 is close, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to be closer to $1,750,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Would you be willing to consider that figure?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** We continue to acknowledge Bob's efforts and maintain a collaborative tone.
* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this time ($50,000 instead of $100,000), signaling that we're reaching our limit.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We briefly remind Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price without being overly pushy. 
* **Direct Question:**  Ending with a direct question about his willingness encourages a clear response from Bob.

At this point, we're carefully balancing our desire for a higher price with the risk of Bob walking away. We're getting close to a point where accepting John's offer might be the safer option if Bob isn't willing to move closer to $1,750,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be at $1,700,000 or lower. How about we discuss $1,725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,725,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still securing a profit of $225,000 over John's offer. 
* **Negotiating Trend:**  Bob has consistently moved towards our price, and this offer shows he's serious about closing the deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good profit. 

While we could try for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether at this stage."
