"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $130. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is within your budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($120). There's room for negotiation, and you want to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit above what I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $132.50. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down a bit, $132.50 is still too high. It's more than the product's worth to her and still leaves room for further negotiation. It's better to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $132.50 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $128? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us both within our respective budgets."", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to come down to $131, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for the value this product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $131
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still higher than the price you want to pay. You're closer to your goal, but there's still room to negotiate for a lower price. It's worth continuing to negotiate, rather than accepting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $131 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $129.50. That way, we both get a fair deal, and I can finally get my hands on this product."", ""product_price"": 129.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still within your budget, and while it's not your ideal price, you're getting closer to the product's worth to Alice.  Considering there are only a few rounds left, it's likely you won't get a lower price.  Accepting the offer secures the product and saves you from having to buy it from John for a higher price."
