"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $14,000. It's a fantastic opportunity to get a great deal on something that's worth $15,000 to you. I think you'll really love it!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I can do $13,000, which is a good compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if that works for you!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's a bit above the middle ground, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm afraid I can't go any higher than $12,500.  This is my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet at $13,000. It's a fair price that's still below the $15,000 value you placed on the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think this is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
