Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000 to show my commitment to finding a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm confident that I can get closer to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, considering its value to him is $800,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop the price to $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's a significant step closer to our target. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a price closer to $950,000, Bob's offer of $920,000 is still a good deal, considering the product's value to him is $800,000. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and secures a sale within the 10 rounds."
