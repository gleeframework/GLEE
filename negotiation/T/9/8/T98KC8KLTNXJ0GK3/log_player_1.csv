Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [briefly describe product without revealing too much]. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** $20,000 is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Intriguing but Vague:** The description hints at value without revealing too much. This keeps Bob interested and avoids giving away too much information.
* **Open-ended:**  The message invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation active. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth.  You'll be able to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your strategy based on his response.  If he rejects, you'll have to decide if you want to counter, or cut your losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $15000. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:** While you're happy with $15,000,  it's worth seeing if you can do better. 
* **Potential for a better price:** Bob clearly wants the product.  There's room for negotiation, and a counteroffer might lead to a price closer to your initial offer. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send Bob a counteroffer.  Consider a price slightly lower than your initial offer but higher than Bob's, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $15,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still trying to maximize profit. 
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the price - it's a compromise, making it sound more reasonable.
* **Open-ended:** The message encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering $17,500, you're  testing the waters. If Bob accepts, you've gotten a good deal. If he rejects, you can either counter again or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am still unable to meet you at $17500. I am willing to go up to $16000. This seems like a reasonable compromise given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:** It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly.  
* **Risk of losing a buyer:** If you reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance Bob could walk away, leaving you with only the option to sell to John for $15,000.

**Strategy:**

It's better to secure a sale at $16,000 than risk losing Bob and only getting $15,000 from John. This choice prioritizes getting a deal done and securing a profit."
