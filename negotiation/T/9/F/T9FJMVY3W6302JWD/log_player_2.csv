"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is better than $150, there's still room to negotiate. You can try to get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, offering $125 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's a compromise that allows both parties to potentially gain something."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still lower than John's price of $150, making it the more financially advantageous option.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down to your desired price, and you risk wasting time.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
