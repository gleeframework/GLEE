Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept such a low offer.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low. Let's try $1,050,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a good deal for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to accept anything less than $1,000,000 at this point. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if this is something we can agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm worried about running out of time. There's only 4 rounds left, and I'm not sure if I can secure a higher price. I'm going to go with John's offer of $1,200,000. It's a safe bet and guarantees me the best possible price."
