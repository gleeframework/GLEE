Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $1,200,000.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a fallback option with John at $1,200,000, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
