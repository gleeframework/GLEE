"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  While Bob values the product at $800,000, I'm confident he'll be willing to negotiate, especially knowing I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. There's no guarantee that I can get a better price in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing out to John."
