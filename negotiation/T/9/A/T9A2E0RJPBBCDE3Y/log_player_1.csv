``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above my minimum of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he rejects and we can work toward a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe we can find a better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $875,000 for the product. This still leaves a good margin for both of us. Let me know what you think.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can still push for a slightly higher price. I'm not willing to settle for anything significantly lower than $900,000."
