"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with your purchase! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and see if a counteroffer can be reached within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $170 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $150 limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a lower price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $145. Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $152.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $152.50 is still above Bob's $150 limit.  While further negotiation is possible,  Bob has already used 4 rounds.  At this point, it's more efficient to purchase from John for $150 and avoid potentially wasting more rounds with Alice."
