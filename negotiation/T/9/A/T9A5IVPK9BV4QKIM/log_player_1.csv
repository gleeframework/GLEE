Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's value to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also adding a friendly message to establish a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value for the product. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
