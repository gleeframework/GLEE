# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While he's getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still too low. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation, as long as I don't run out of time."
