"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
