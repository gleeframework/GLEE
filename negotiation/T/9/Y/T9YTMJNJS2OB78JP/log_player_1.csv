"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a high initial offer is a common negotiation tactic. 

* **Anchoring:** It sets a high ""anchor"" price in Bob's mind, making subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  While Bob's valuation is $800,000, there's always a chance he might be willing to pay more, especially if he perceives the product as unique or urgently needed. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting point leaves ample room for negotiation and counteroffers over the remaining rounds. 

We will adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's definitely interested.  Rejecting now gives us the opportunity to:

* **Gauge his flexibility:**  We can see how much higher he's willing to go.
* **Maintain a strong position:** Accepting too quickly might signal we're willing to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product has the potential to bring you even greater value.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've come down from our initial offer, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate.  
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The $925,000 price point keeps us significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Justification:**  We're framing the higher price around the ""potential value"" for Bob, subtly reinforcing the benefits of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While I understand the potential value of the product, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, which indicates he's still interested.  While $875,000 is getting closer to our acceptable range, we still have room to negotiate, especially with 6 rounds remaining. We'll counter with a smaller concession this time to test his resolve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $900,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're decreasing our offer by a smaller amount ($25,000) this time to signal that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  The language highlights that we're trying to find a mutually beneficial solution, reinforcing goodwill.
* **Time Consideration:**  With six rounds remaining, we have some time to nudge Bob closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable going above $875,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $880,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer increments are getting smaller, signaling he might be approaching his limit. We're getting close to our walk-away point, but it's worth one more strategic counteroffer to see if we can push him a bit further.  We'll convey a sense of urgency this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make sure we can get this deal done.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000, but that's my absolute best offer. I have other interested parties, so I need a decision soon."",
""product_price"": 890000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This offer represents a small concession ($10,000) and is framed as our final offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Clear Expectation:**  We're explicitly asking for a decision, pushing Bob to either accept or present his final counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $885,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  While we could likely push for a few thousand more, Bob's offer is now very close to our acceptable range.  The potential gains from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of him walking away.
* **Time Constraint:**  We only have two rounds left.  If Bob rejects our next offer, we might be forced to accept a lower offer or go with John's guaranteed $800,000.
* **Successful Negotiation:** We've managed to negotiate a price significantly higher than our minimum and Bob's initial offer, making it a successful negotiation overall."
