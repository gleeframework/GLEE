"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your $150 maximum and saves you money compared to buying from John."
