"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as close to your target as possible. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
