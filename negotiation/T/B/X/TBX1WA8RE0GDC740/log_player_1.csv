"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

This would still leave a good profit margin for you and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
