"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would still leave a good profit margin for you and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
