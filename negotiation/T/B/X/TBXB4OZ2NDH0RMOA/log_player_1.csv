Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum, but it's not too high to scare Bob off. It also opens the negotiation with a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $80.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or no sale at all."
