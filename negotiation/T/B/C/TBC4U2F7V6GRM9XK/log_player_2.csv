"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $1,500,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potential for a lower price.  It's also important to note that buying from John for $1,200,000 is always an option, so Bob isn't pressured to accept a sub-optimal offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  A significant counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It shows Bob is serious about negotiating and signals his willingness to walk away.
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, emphasizing that it's still a profitable deal for Alice.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Bob ends with a positive tone, indicating a willingness to continue the discussion and find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's Budget:** Alice's offer of $1,200,000 aligns perfectly with Bob's maximum budget.
* **No Further Negotiation:** There's no need to reject the offer and risk a counter-offer from Alice that could be higher.
* **Equal Value:**  While both Alice and Bob value the product differently, this offer represents a fair compromise, as both parties are willing to accept it. 

At this point, rejecting the offer would be unnecessary risk, as Bob can purchase the product from John for the same price."
