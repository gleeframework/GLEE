"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay.
* **Better Option:**  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

Bob should make a counteroffer lower than $14,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000, which is more than Bob's maximum.
* **Counteroffer:** By offering $13,000, Bob is trying to find a middle ground while still saving money. This price is closer to Alice's value for the product.

**Next Steps:**

Now it's Alice's turn to either accept or reject Bob's counteroffer. Depending on her response, Bob will need to decide whether to adjust his offer further or explore other options (e.g., accepting a higher price or buying from John)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $13500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $13,500, which is within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price.
* **Buying from John:**  While buying from John would still be within Bob's budget, Alice's offer is $500 cheaper.

**Next Steps:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer and purchase the product for $13,500, as this is the best deal he can get at this point."
