"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $1,150,000.  Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay at this point. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
