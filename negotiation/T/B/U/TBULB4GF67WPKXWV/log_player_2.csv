"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's something you've been looking for and I know you'd get a lot of value out of it. I'm offering it to you for $10,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for the value you'll receive, and allows me to make a bit more than my minimum price.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
