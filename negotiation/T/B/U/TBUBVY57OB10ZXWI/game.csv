"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay a significant amount for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good investment.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm ready to close this deal quickly - how about $980,000 and we have an agreement?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob. I can see that you're eager to make a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000, but I have to admit that I'm getting a bit concerned that we might be leaving some money on the table. I'm hoping we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
