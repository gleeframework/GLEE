{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than the product's value to you ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation. This approach aims to maximize your potential profit while still being open to a reasonable deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  Rejecting Bob's offer gives you the chance to counter with a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your target. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can continue the negotiation and aim for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,050,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that still reflects the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
