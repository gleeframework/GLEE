"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This seems like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,050,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that still reflects the value of the product for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
