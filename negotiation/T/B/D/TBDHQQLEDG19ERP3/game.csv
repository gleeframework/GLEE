"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a steal!",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $140. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $140 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $125. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if we can make a deal at that price.",110.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $117.50. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",117.5,Alice,7,
