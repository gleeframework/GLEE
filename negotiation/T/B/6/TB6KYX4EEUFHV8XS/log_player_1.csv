"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $12,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below the value of this product.
