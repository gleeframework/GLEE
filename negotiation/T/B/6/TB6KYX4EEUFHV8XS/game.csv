"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I could consider a price of $18,000. I'm confident you'll see a strong return on this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $18,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
