"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is truly significant, and I'm confident it can bring even greater returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
