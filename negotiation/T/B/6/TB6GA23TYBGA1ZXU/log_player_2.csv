"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a starting offer significantly below your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite but clearly states my position and desired price point. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $800,000, I'm aiming for a final price somewhere between that and John's $1,000,000 offer, which serves as my walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on your price.  However, $1,800,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $950,000?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer, but in a smaller increment ($150,000) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate while still moving towards my goal.
* **Target Zone:** My new offer puts us closer to the midpoint between my initial offer and Alice's current offer, which is a common negotiation tactic. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'm keeping John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as my upper limit. I'm willing to walk away from the deal with Alice if I can't get a price close to that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate us trying to find a middle ground here.  While I'm motivated to sell, I have to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,375,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is making concessions, but her current offer of $1,375,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of:

* **Stalemate:**  We might reach a point where neither of us is willing to budge further.
* **Overpaying:** Even if Alice comes down a bit more, I'm likely to end up paying significantly more than John's price. 

Therefore, the most logical decision at this point is to secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
