Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $10,000 is a good starting point. It allows for room to negotiate down without feeling like I'm giving away too much. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  Adding ""open to reasonable offers"" signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $8,000 gives me a baseline and confidence during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob is offering that. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's no upside to rejecting and counter-offering. I'm not going to get more than $8,000 from Bob, and John is also willing to pay that amount.
* **Efficiency:**  Accepting Bob's offer saves time and effort, and ensures I get the best price possible without risking anything."
