"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth accepting Alice's offer at this point. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a strong starting counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's still within the range of what the product is worth to you. You're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still asking for more than you're willing to pay. While $1,100,000 is closer to your goal, you can still try to get a better price.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.  It's also still significantly lower than Alice's offer, giving her incentive to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still not worth it compared to buying from John.  There's still room for negotiation, and you're better off trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is your final offer. You're offering Alice her minimum acceptable price, making it a win-win situation. If she rejects, you'll buy from John, so there's no need to negotiate further."
