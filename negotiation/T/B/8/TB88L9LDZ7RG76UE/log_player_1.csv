"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely and adjusting my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial valuation. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and gives us both a good chance of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering a low price. While it's getting closer, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to my valuation. I'm also considering selling to John at this point, as his offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,050,000.  I'm starting to feel the pressure as we get closer to the halfway point of the negotiation. While John's offer is tempting, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm hoping this counteroffer will finally persuade him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk losing the sale to John and I'm happy to secure the $1,000,000 for the product."
