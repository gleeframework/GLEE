Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,150?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe this product is truly worth it."", ""product_price"": 10150}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd like to get a higher price, I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds, and it seems unlikely he'll come up to a price that meets my minimum needs.  John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, which is what I need."
