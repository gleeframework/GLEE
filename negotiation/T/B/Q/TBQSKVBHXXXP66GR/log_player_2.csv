"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I believe that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price but still above her perceived value. This tactic aims to: 

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A strong counter-offer helps understand how willing Alice is to negotiate.
* **Establish a lower target:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets a lower benchmark for future negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a lot more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $8,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming closer to her actual value, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll continue to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a strict budget. How about $7,000?  That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  We increase our offer to show Alice we're willing to move, but not drastically. 
* **Staying Below Value:**  Our offer remains comfortably below our maximum budget and Alice's last offer, leaving space for further negotiation.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** By highlighting our increase and framing it as a compromise, we encourage Alice to reciprocate with further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go below $7,500. This product is still worth a lot more to me than that, but I'm trying to be flexible. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to a price we'd consider accepting, but we're still early in the negotiation. We can push a bit further and try to secure a price closer to $7,000. There's a risk Alice will hold firm, but it's a calculated risk worth taking."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. Let's settle this right now. How about $7,200? It's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're strategically offering a price slightly above the midpoint between our last offer ($7,000) and her current offer ($7,500). This shows movement on our part and encourages her to meet us halfway.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's settle this right now"" aims to instill a bit of urgency, potentially prompting Alice to accept rather than risk prolonging the negotiation.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** While not explicitly our final offer, we're moving closer to a price we're comfortable accepting. This gives the impression that we're nearing our limit, which might push Alice to agree."
