"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I believe that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a lot more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $8,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a strict budget. How about $7,000?  That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go below $7,500. This product is still worth a lot more to me than that, but I'm trying to be flexible. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. Let's settle this right now. How about $7,200? It's a fair deal for both of us.",7200.0,Bob,6,
