"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  This is a great price considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than Alice's value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Bob has a better option to buy from John for $1,200,000.  There's no need to risk Alice rejecting a counteroffer and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1350000? This would be a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,200,000.  There's a chance Alice will reject further counteroffers, potentially leaving Bob with no product and a wasted negotiation.  It's best to stick with the sure thing and buy from John."
