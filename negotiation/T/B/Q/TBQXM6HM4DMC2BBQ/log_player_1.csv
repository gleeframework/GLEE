Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great price considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product, making it more appealing.
* **Room for compromise:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer without me feeling forced to accept an unreasonably low price.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter-offer to see if we can find a middle ground.
* **John's offer:** I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,350,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm counter-offering with $1,350,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Compromise:** The message emphasizes a willingness to compromise, signaling to Bob that I'm open to finding a solution. 
* **Fairness:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" for both parties, attempting to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves space for further negotiation if Bob still finds the price too high.
* **Plan B:** I'm still aware of John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,250,000.
* **Risk of losing a sale:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely, and I'll have to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is less profitable.
* **Closing the deal:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close a deal quickly and avoid further negotiation. 

It's a good idea to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale at this point.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and minimizes the risk of losing a sale."
