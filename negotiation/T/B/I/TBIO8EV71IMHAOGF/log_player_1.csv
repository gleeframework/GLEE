Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've received, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to get a better price from Bob.
* **Strategic Overpricing:** Starting with an offer of $18,000 leaves room for negotiation. Even if Bob counter-offers, you're likely to land above your minimum price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Highlighting other interest (""interest I've received"") creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **Polite and Open:** The tone is positive and encourages Bob to engage in discussion."
