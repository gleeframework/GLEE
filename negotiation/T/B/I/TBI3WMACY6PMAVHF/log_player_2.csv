"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could work together. My initial offer for the product is $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation of $12,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You have the opportunity to negotiate further, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

While $9,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a more favorable price."

Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to your maximum budget of $8,000. However, since you have more negotiation rounds available, it's worth trying to see if you can get a better price. You can still make a counteroffer and potentially secure the product for a price closer to your ideal $8,000."
