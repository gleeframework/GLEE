"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit away from what I can afford. Would you be willing to go down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $650,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $675,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $675,000 is pushing my budget.  Would you be willing to settle at $660,000? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",660000.0,Bob,6,
