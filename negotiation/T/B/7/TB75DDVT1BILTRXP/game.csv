"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price for the product, but I'm still not quite there with your latest offer.  I'm willing to go to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this point. Let's try to close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to sell the product for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
