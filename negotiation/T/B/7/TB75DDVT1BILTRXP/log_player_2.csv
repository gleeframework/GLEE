"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I need to receive and a good price for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to get for the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. Let's finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but $1,075,000 is still above your maximum budget. You have 7 rounds remaining, so it's worth trying to negotiate further. If you can get Alice down to $1,000,000, you'll save $75,000 compared to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a good price for the product, but I'm still not quite there with your latest offer.  I'm willing to go to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this point. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to sell the product for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
