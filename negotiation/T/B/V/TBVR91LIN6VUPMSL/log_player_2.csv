Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his budget, and there's a better option available.  He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or buy from John for a guaranteed $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10500.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her original price, it's still higher than his budget, and he can get the product from John for $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice again, but buying from John is the safest option at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $9750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about $10000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's offer is still higher than his budget, and although she is compromising, it doesn't seem like she'll go any lower. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid further negotiation."
