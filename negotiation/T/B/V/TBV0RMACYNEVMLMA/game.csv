"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'd love to get it for that price, considering it's a great product and all the extra benefits you mentioned. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $12000 is a fair price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $13500? That would be a good middle ground for us both.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13500. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
