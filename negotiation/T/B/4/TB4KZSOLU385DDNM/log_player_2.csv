"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its features and your specific needs. I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob wants to lower the price significantly from Alice's initial offer. A $1,000 drop is a good starting point to signal serious negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:** $13,000 is still above Alice's minimum value of $12,000, suggesting a potential deal. 
* **Clear communication:** Bob explains his reasoning and expresses his willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that, especially considering the value it will bring you. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, but there's still a $500 gap. Bob can likely push for a lower price.
* **Maintaining a strong stance:**  Rejecting the offer demonstrates that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:** Bob should make another counteroffer, ideally aiming for something closer to $13,000.  He can reiterate his interest in the product but emphasize his need for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference at $13,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is offering a compromise by meeting Alice halfway on their last offer. This shows good faith and a willingness to work towards a deal. 
* **Justification:**  Bob provides a reason for his offer, reinforcing the idea of fairness.
* **Staying within budget:** $13,250 is still within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price point.

**Next Steps:** 

If Alice accepts this offer, the deal is closed.  If Alice rejects, Bob can continue to negotiate, but should be prepared to either raise his offer slightly or consider buying from John if the price gets too close to his $15,000 limit."
