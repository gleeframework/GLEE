"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he's likely to consider this offer.
* **It's below my minimum:** I'm willing to sell for at least $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It shows I'm willing to compromise:** By offering a lower price than my minimum, I demonstrate that I'm open to negotiation. 

I'm also sending a message with the offer to make it more personal and encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $1,100,000. While he's showing interest, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. 

It's better to keep negotiating with Bob and try to secure a more favorable price. There are still 8 rounds remaining, which gives me time to explore other options. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but I'd like to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  This gives us both some room to compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** This counter-offer is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's lower than my initial offer and still closer to my minimum. 
* **Message:**  I'm using the message to reiterate my position and to encourage further negotiation.
* **Positioning:** I'm trying to keep the negotiation moving forward while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $975,000? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is closer to my initial offer, it's still below my minimum price of $1,200,000 and significantly lower than my last counteroffer of $1,050,000.  I'm not yet ready to accept such a low price, especially since we have several rounds left.  I'd like to continue exploring if we can reach a deal that is closer to my minimum valuation.

Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always a viable option, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,012,500.  This is a fair compromise that reflects both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 1012500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous offer.  
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the compromise and fairness of the offer. 
* **Positioning:** I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us, and I'm making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $990,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $990,000 is closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000 than his previous offers, it's still significantly lower than my last counteroffer of $1,012,500. I'm not ready to accept such a low price yet.  

It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below my minimum valuation. 

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If not, I can always sell to John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your efforts to find a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle on $1,001,000. This is a small increase from your last offer, but it allows us to both reach a deal that is more than a compromise but less than my last offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1001000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** This offer is just slightly above Bob's last offer but still below my previous counteroffer. 
* **Message:** I'm again emphasizing a spirit of compromise and a desire to reach a deal.  
* **Positioning:** I'm trying to signal that I'm getting closer to accepting a price but also remaining firm in my minimum valuation. I'm also highlighting that we can both reach an acceptable deal with this offer.  

The goal is to keep the negotiation moving forward without risking closing a deal that is too low for my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. How about $985,000? I'm willing to make a bit of a sacrifice to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached Round 8, and Bob's offer of $985,000 is still significantly below my minimum price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating and see if we can reach a better price, the risk of continuing is high.  

* **Time is running out:** We only have two rounds left, and it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer.
* **Guaranteed sale:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, which is a much better deal. 
* **Potential for further delays:** If I reject Bob's offer, we may have to go through multiple counteroffers in the remaining rounds, potentially delaying the sale further.

Therefore, it's best to accept John's offer and secure the sale at a price that meets my minimum valuation."
