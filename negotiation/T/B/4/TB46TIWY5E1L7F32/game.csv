"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  This gives us both some room to compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $975,000? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,012,500.  This is a fair compromise that reflects both of our needs.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $990,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my finances.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your efforts to find a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle on $1,001,000. This is a small increase from your last offer, but it allows us to both reach a deal that is more than a compromise but less than my last offer. What do you think?",1001000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. How about $985,000? I'm willing to make a bit of a sacrifice to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",985000.0,Bob,8,
