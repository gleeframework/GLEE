"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's quite a bit higher than I'm able to comfortably pay at this time. Given my current budget, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation and demonstrates my genuine interest in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However,  $2,200,000 is a significant jump from your proposed $1,200,000. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
