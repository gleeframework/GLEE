"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,750,000.  It's not a good deal for Bob, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $1,500,000, but it's a better deal than buying from John. Given the negotiation is moving in the right direction, accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
