"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as I have another opportunity available at that price.  Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have another opportunity at $800,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",820000.0,Alice,5,
