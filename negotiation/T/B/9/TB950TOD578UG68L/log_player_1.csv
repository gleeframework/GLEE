Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. It's also below Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000, making it potentially attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a significant amount, and it's closer to my desired price point. I believe this counteroffer is fair and will encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is only $25,000 less than my previous offer, and it's higher than selling to John. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
