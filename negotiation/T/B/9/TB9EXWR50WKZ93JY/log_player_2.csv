"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. This is a fair price considering its unique value. I'm confident you'll see the potential in it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always a good strategy to start by rejecting an initial offer that's too high, as it allows you to:

* **Signal your intention to negotiate:**  Rejecting the offer shows Alice you're serious about getting a better price.
* **Open the door for counteroffers:**  You can now propose a price closer to your desired range. 
* **Explore Alice's motivations:**  By seeing how she responds to your counteroffer, you'll gain insight into how much she's willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1750000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also being within your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than your desired price point. It's beneficial to keep negotiating to potentially get a better deal. Here's why:

* **Further negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a price closer to your $1,000,000 target.
* **Alice's flexibility:** By seeing how far she's willing to come down, you can gauge her urgency to sell and how much she values the product.
* **Avoid overpaying:**  Jumping at $1,750,000 might be too hasty, especially if a better deal is possible."
