Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. How about we discuss a price closer to $1,100,000? I hope this suggestion is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that $1,250,000 is quite high given the current market conditions and the fact that you're the only seller. Could we perhaps aim for $1,200,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.
