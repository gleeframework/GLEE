I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, giving me some room to negotiate. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a chance by offering a higher price. If he accepts, I'll make a good profit. If he rejects, I'll still be able to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
