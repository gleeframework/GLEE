Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's offer:**  I know I can get at least $1,200,000 from John, so this is my safety net. 
* **Potential upside:**  I'm aiming higher with Bob, hoping to get more than John's offer. $1,500,000 is a significant profit for me while potentially still being a good deal for Bob, depending on his perceived value. 
* **Risk assessment:** There is a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk of settling for John's offer. 

**Strategy:** 

By offering a price higher than my guaranteed value, I create an incentive for Bob to consider buying. If he values the product more than $1,500,000, he's likely to accept. If not, I have my fallback option with John."
