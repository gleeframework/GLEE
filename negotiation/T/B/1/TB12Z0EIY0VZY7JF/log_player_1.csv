"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I want to see how much negotiating room there is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still reflects the value I place on the product.  I believe this is a fair price that Bob might be willing to accept, given his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Although getting $10,800 is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $12,500.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize that we are getting close to a deal.  This price is still higher than his last offer, but closer to his stated value of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I have a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12200}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,200. This is a small concession, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible.  Given that I only have a few rounds left, I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to risk one more round to see if we can reach a deal. If it fails, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

This is my final offer. I'm lowering my price to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John for $12,000."
