"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $110. Since I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, this leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more, but I'm also prepared to lower the price in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $100, and I'm not willing to sell it for that amount. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price to $95. This is still above my minimum price of $100, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell it at this price yet. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. I have a few more rounds left and John is always a good backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $90. This is a further compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal.  I'm getting closer to his offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell it at this price yet. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. It's getting a bit risky to hold out, but I'm hoping to get closer to my goal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm lowering my price to $89. We are getting very close to a deal and I think this offer might be enough to convince Bob. I'm feeling a bit pressured by the limited rounds left, but I want to see if we can agree on a price that is fair for both of us."
