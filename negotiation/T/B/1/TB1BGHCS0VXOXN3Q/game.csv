"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12000 is a bit steep for me. How about $10000? That's still a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  This still leaves you a good amount of value, and I'm happy to close the deal at that price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a little high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10500. That way we both get a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10500 is closer to my goal, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet at $10750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
