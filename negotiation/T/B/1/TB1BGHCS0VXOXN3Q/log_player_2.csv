"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $10,000? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  $10,000 is a reasonable starting point, offering Alice a good profit while still saving Bob a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  This still leaves you a good amount of value, and I'm happy to close the deal at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to $10,000 as possible.  He's willing to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice to budge.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still not the best possible outcome for him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a little high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the product as close to $10,000 as possible. He's showing flexibility by increasing his offer, but he's also remaining firm in his desire to get a good deal. This counteroffer offers a compromise, and hopefully, Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10500 is closer to my goal, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet at $10750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target:**  $10,750 is only $750 away from Bob's desired $10,000.
* **Limited rounds remain:** With only 5 rounds left, Bob doesn't have much time to continue negotiating.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance Alice might become unwilling to negotiate further, and Bob could end up buying from John at a much higher price.

While Bob would ideally prefer $10,500, accepting this offer is a good compromise that secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids potential risks."
