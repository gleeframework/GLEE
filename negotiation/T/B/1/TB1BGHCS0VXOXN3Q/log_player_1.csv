"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($15,000) but still leaves me with a good profit ($12,000 > $8,000 minimum).
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone will hopefully encourage Bob to engage in negotiations.
* **Highlighting Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value to him may make him more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12000 is a bit steep for me. How about $10000? That's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum target of $8,000. I want to see if I can get him closer to my desired price.  
* **Staying in the Game:** I see potential for a better deal, so I'm not willing to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This still leaves you a good amount of value, and I'm happy to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still being close to my target price.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll gain, making the deal more attractive.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiations moving in a positive direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a little high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10500. That way we both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Not Enough:** Bob's offer is closer to my target, but it's still below my minimum of $8,000.  
* **Potential for More:**  I see an opportunity to get closer to my desired price, so I'm willing to keep negotiating.
* **Keeping Options Open:** While I'm not willing to settle for $10,500, I'm also not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is closer to my goal, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet at $10,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the proposed price, making it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm subtly pushing for a final agreement, making it seem like this is the last offer I'm willing to make."
