Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it would be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a strong fallback option with John at $1,000,000, ensuring you won't be pressured into a low offer from Bob."
