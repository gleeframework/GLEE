Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product. Given its incredible value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is quite low. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below the value of this product.
