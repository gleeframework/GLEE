"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $80, and it's significantly less than the $150 that John is willing to pay. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering its worth to me is $80. I'd appreciate it if you could consider my offer.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept $100 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This still allows you to save some money compared to the $150 alternative, while also reflecting the value I place on the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Can you consider my offer?",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. Considering your budget and the value you see in the product, how about we settle at $107? This is slightly higher than your last offer but still below the $150 alternative. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",107.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I've given this some thought, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $104. This respects your budget while still allowing you to save compared to the alternative. I hope this proposal is more agreeable to you.",104.0,Alice,7,
