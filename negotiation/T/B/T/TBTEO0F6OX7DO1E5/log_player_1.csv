{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation space.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing to Bob. 

This strategy aims to find a price that is mutually agreeable and maximizes my earnings. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I also have a backup buyer (John) to ensure I don't lose out on a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John because I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great price for this valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Middle Ground:**  I'm offering a price ($10,000) that's in the middle of Bob's offer ($8,000) and my initial offer ($12,000). This shows flexibility and encourages continued negotiations. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and open tone to encourage a positive outcome.

This counter-offer aims to find a mutually agreeable price without losing sight of my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's also a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer of $8,000.  At this point, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. I don't want to risk Bob backing out completely and losing this potential sale.  Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $9,000."
