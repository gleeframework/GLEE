"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $10,000 to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $8,200. This is a fair price considering the market value of the product is $10,000 to you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,500? That's a fair offer considering it's more than halfway.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'll meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
