* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice is offering the product for $10,000, while John wants $12,000.
* **You can save money by accepting Alice's offer.** You'll save $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **The product is worth up to $12,000 to you.**  So, even at $10,000, you're still getting a good deal."
