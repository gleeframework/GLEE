"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. While I value it at no less than $800000, I'm willing to part with it for $900000.  This represents a significant savings for you, given its worth to you at $1000000.  I'm confident you'll find it a wise investment.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
