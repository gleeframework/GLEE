"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're willing to start negotiations at $120. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and the product is worth $150 to you, you should reject Alice's initial offer of $120. You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position, and we're willing to meet you halfway. Our counteroffer is $110 for the product. Let us know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than $120, you're still aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again allows you to potentially get a lower price. You have 7 rounds remaining, so there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering purchasing from John."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, after careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer to $107 for the product. We hope this meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. Please let us know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $107 is very close to your counteroffer of $105. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and you could risk losing the deal entirely. It's also worth noting that you have 5 rounds remaining, which means there's a chance you could negotiate a lower price later on, but there's also a chance that Alice might walk away from the deal.  At this point, accepting the offer of $107 seems like the most reasonable option, as it still saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
