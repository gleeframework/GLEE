Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer is a compromise. It's higher than what you'd get from John, giving you more profit, but still lower than the maximum Bob is willing to pay. This strategy maximizes your chances of Bob accepting the offer while still getting a good price."
