"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
