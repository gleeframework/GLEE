{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of the product, but below your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit.  It also sets a strong starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference? I'll accept $125 for the product. This is still a fair price considering the value of the item, and it allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}
