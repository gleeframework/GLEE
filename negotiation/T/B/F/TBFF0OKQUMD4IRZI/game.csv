"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that's a number we can work with.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
