"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,300,000 is far above his budget, and he has a better alternative in John.  It makes sense to start negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that's a number we can work with."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, it's the best option for Bob."
