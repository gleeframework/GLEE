Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that's a number we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
