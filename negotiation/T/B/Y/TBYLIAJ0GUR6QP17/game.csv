"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $18,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $13,000",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a very competitive price for the value you're getting.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to being convinced, but I still think $16,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my final offer",14000.0,Bob,6,
