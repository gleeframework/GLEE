Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information given:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a premium. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $2,000 markup (around 16%) is a starting point. It allows room for negotiation while still being a significant gain if Bob accepts.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By framing it as an exclusive offer, you might incentivize Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you have any insight into how Bob negotiates, you might adjust your approach. 
* **Market Dynamics:** Is this a hot commodity?  If so, you could potentially aim even higher. 

This first offer is a starting point. Be prepared to potentially negotiate if Bob counters!"
