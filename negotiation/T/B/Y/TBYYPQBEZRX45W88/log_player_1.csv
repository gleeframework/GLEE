This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than your minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more like $1,250,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer Bob. I can still make more money if I can push the price up a bit further."

Bob's offer is still too low.  It's closer to my minimum, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
