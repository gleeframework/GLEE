"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. I believe it would be a significant asset to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This establishes a firm anchor point and leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A lower starting price might be quickly accepted, leaving money on the table.  
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value without revealing our bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, I believe $1,400,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below his perceived value of the product. While it's above our minimum, we have room to negotiate. Rejecting his offer signals that we believe the product is worth more and keeps the negotiation open. We are still in the early stages, and selling to John would mean leaving a lot of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  the value this product brings is substantial.  I could consider a price closer to $1,300,000. This reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to the middle ground between Bob's offer and our initial price, indicating willingness to negotiate.
* **Justifying the Value:** We reiterate the product's value, anchoring the price in its worth rather than just numbers.
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're still above our minimum and have room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to move up to $1,175,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's still interested and willing to negotiate. However, the current offer is still significantly below his perceived value and our target price. We are willing to be patient and continue negotiating for a better deal, as we still have plenty of rounds left. Selling to John at this point would be premature."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,250,000?  This is a fair price considering the significant value this product holds."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price exactly between our last offer ($1,300,000) and his ($1,175,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  We continue to subtly emphasize the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By framing this as a potential ""settlement,"" we introduce a subtle sense of urgency without resorting to hardball tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a unique product, and I'm ready to make a deal. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant profit margin above our minimum price ($1,000,000). 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has been steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. Accepting now capitalizes on his momentum.
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, there's no guarantee of reaching a significantly better deal. Accepting now secures a good profit without risking prolonged negotiation. 
* **""Competitive Offer"" Tactic:** Bob's message is designed to create a sense of urgency and finality. While we shouldn't let this solely dictate our decision, it's a factor to consider.

In conclusion, $1,200,000 represents a successful negotiation outcome. It's a strong return, and waiting longer might not yield a proportionally better deal."
