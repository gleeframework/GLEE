"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm confident it's worth at least $10,000. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,250? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

Alice's offer is still slightly above your budget.  While it's closer, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  Buying from John for $10,000 is the best option to ensure you get the product within your budget."
