"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can pay at this time.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this exceptional item.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1600000 is still outside my price range.  I can offer $1400000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I am genuinely interested in making this purchase.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1400000. I can offer it to you for $1600000 again, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can meet you at $1550000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and your previous offers. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1450000. This is a significant step closer to your previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach an agreement. I can offer it to you for $1525000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and your previous offers. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1525000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1475000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. It seems like we are very close now.",1475000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession to try to reach an agreement. I can offer it to you for $1495000. This is as close to my minimum price as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1495000.0,Alice,9,
