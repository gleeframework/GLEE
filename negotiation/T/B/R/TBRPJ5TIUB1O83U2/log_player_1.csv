Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This gives me a good starting point, and allows room for negotiation if Bob is interested but doesn't want to pay that much. It also gives me a clear idea of whether Bob truly values the product. If he rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating.  However, if he rejects this offer and doesn't counter, I'll know his interest might not be as high, and I might be better off selling to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for that just yet. I think I can still squeeze out a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to be flexible, but I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to get Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a decent increase from his initial $12,000 offer.  While I'd love to keep negotiating and get closer to my initial asking price, I'm not sure if I'll be able to get much higher.  Given that I can sell to John for $12,000,  accepting Bob's offer of $12,500 is the best option. It secures a better price for me, and I can avoid any more back and forth that may not yield a higher offer."
