"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has tremendous value for you, potentially exceeding $1,000,000.  I'm offering it to you at a fair price of $900,000. This represents a significant opportunity for your business. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, it's still above her perceived value. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me. While I value our potential partnership, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This price reflects the product's unique value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is still within my budget and is a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price than John's offer of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving me with only John's option.  Accepting this offer saves me $125,000 compared to buying from John."
