Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Above Your Minimum:** $120 is significantly above your minimum acceptable price of $80, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly.

This strategy aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product at a price lower than his perceived value, and you get a great price above your minimum."
