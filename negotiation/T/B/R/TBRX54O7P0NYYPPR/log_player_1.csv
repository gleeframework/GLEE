Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth at least $10,000. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm offering it to you for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to aim higher.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 gives Bob the impression the product is highly valued and leaves room for potential negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **Confidence:** The tone of the message aims to convey confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception.

**Important Note:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, it's always good to aim higher in negotiations to maximize potential profit."
