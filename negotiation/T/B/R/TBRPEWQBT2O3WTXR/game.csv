"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $9000. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $9500. How about we compromise at $12500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
