"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to hopefully reach a price closer to the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $115? I think that's fair considering what it's worth to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's still closer to my goal than selling to John. I'm going to counteroffer and try to squeeze a bit more out of the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $122.5 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $120. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is very close to my goal and is definitely better than selling to John.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
