{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but her offer is already above your maximum.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, but I need to be certain this is the best deal for my business."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still slightly above my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, and I believe further negotiation could bring us closer to that number. It's worth a few more rounds to see if we can meet in the middle."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to offer $1,325,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my counteroffer and within my budget.  While I could potentially push for a lower price, there's a good chance we'll go back and forth for a few more rounds.  Accepting this offer means saving money and securing the product without risking a breakdown in negotiations. It's a good compromise."
