"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I can't quite agree to $1,125,000. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,062,500? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,062,500 is still not close enough to my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
