``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum because I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  This leaves room for negotiation without losing too much, while also signaling my confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I can't quite agree to $1,125,000. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,062,500? It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500.

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not willing to settle for anything lower than $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
