# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message uses a lot of sales tactics to inflate the perceived value, the actual offer of $1,200,000 is less than your $1,500,000 maximum and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
