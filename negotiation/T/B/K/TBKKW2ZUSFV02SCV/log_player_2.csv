"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds significant value for me, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection or business. Given its importance to me, I am considering offering it to you at a special price. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $12,000. I understand its worth to you is $10,000, but I hope this offer presents a mutually beneficial solution. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her product's value to her, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Your goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John accomplishes this."
