{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum price ($150). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and highlight the value of the product for Bob, making him feel like he's getting a good deal. 

I'm aiming to get the highest price possible while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $80. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price ($150) and my initial offer ($175). Accepting it would be a huge loss for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price.  I'll proceed with a counteroffer in the next round to try and find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price from $175 to $120. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal and offer a compromise. I emphasize the value of the product to justify the price.

By counteroffering, I'm aiming to reach a price closer to my desired amount without completely shutting down the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum price of $150, it's still significantly lower. I'm not comfortable selling at such a loss. I'll make another counteroffer to try and push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $110, which is closer to Bob's offer of $100 but still above my minimum price of $150. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing Bob's interest in the product and suggesting a final compromise.  I'm also using positive language (""Let's make this deal happen!"") to encourage a quick agreement.

I'm aiming for a final price that's acceptable to both of us, while still getting a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum price of $150.  While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product at a significant loss.  I've already made several concessions and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher.  To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
