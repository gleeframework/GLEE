"Bob, I believe this product has significant value for you, given its potential to enhance your operations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000, which is still well below its true market value. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product could be beneficial, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I could do  $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,100,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't fully reflect the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to meet your needs. This is still a fair price considering the potential value you'll gain from this product. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I need to be around $1,150,000 to make this work.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit lower than what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
