"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $170."", ""product_price"": 170} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still lower than Bob's perceived value ($120), giving him room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Note:** This is just the initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is below my minimum, but not drastically so.  I can likely squeeze out more value.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to my minimum. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows I'm serious about getting a fair price.

**Next Steps:**

* In Round 3, I'll counter with a price between $140 and $150, potentially offering a slight discount on my initial price to show flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $140 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $155. This is a great deal for a product worth so much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 155} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm bridging the gap between my minimum and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to see the price as a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language like ""What do you think?"" to invite further dialogue and potentially reach a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is still below my minimum, it's very close. This makes it tempting to accept.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll use the next round to counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to close the gap further.

**Next Steps:**

* In Round 5, I'll counter with a price between $145 and $150, potentially offering a slight discount on my previous offer to show flexibility."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference and go with $147.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 147.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering a price exactly halfway between my previous offer ($155) and Bob's offer ($140), showing willingness to compromise.
* **Finality Emphasis:** I'm suggesting this is a good final offer, using language like ""we can finally close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $142? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of Losing Value:** Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum.  Further negotiation might lead to a price even lower than $142.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are already halfway through the negotiations, and there are only 4 rounds left.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $150, which is higher than Bob's latest offer and meets my minimum requirement.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries too much risk of ending up with a lower price or not closing the deal at all."
