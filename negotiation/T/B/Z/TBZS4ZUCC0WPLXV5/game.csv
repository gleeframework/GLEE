"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $13,500 for it, though. What do you say?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $15,500. I'm confident you'll be happy with that, and it's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think the product is worth a bit more than $15,500. How about we compromise at $16,250?",16250.0,Alice,5,
