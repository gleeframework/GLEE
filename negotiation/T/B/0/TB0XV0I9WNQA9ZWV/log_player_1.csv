Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $180. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my minimum price of $150. I know Bob values the product at $80, so he might be willing to negotiate a bit, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to come close to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low. It's less than half of what I value the product at.  I'm not going to accept that. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but I'll be prepared to walk away if we can't find a mutually agreeable price."

I'm lowering my price to $160, which is still above my minimum but shows some flexibility. This is a reasonable middle ground, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me there. If he doesn't, I'm still prepared to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's higher than his initial offer, it's still significantly below what I value the product at. I'm not going to accept that. I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer, but I'll be prepared to sell to John for $150 if we can't find a mutually agreeable price."

I'm lowering my price to $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will realize that this is a fair price and will finally accept my offer. If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell the product to John for $150."
