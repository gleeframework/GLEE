,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $90?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $75 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $92?",92.0,Alice,5,
