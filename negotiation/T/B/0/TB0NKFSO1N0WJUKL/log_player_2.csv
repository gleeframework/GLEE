"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe you'll find great value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. You know John is willing to sell the product for $100, but there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price in a subsequent round of negotiation."
