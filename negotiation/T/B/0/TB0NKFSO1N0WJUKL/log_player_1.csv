Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe you'll find great value in it."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some space for potential haggling if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Ensure a Sale:** Offering it for more than $90 risks Bob rejecting the deal, leading to me accepting the $80 offer from John."
