,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay at this time. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000. This feels like a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,020,000.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm seeing progress in our negotiation, but $1,020,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,010,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1010000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
