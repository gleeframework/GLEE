"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $125 is a bit low for me, considering what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $160.  It's a fair price, and it gives us both something to work with.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $135 is still a little below what I need.  Let's meet in the middle - $145. I think this is a good price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'll go up to $140, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",140.0,Bob,6,
