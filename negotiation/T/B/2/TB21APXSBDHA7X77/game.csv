"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and it reflects the value I see in it for my business.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value the product brings to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,
