"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $70.  Would that work for you?",70.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can do $80, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
