Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $14,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, even at a slightly higher price point than you initially anticipated."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. It also creates the perception of a ""deal"" for Bob compared to your guaranteed sale price.
* **Value Highlighting:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the higher price. 

By starting with a strong offer, you increase your chances of either:

1. **Bob accepting:**  You secure a higher profit than selling to John.
2. **Negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially meet in the middle, still exceeding your $15,000 baseline."
