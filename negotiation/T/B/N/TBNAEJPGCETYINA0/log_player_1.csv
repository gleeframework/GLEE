{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have significant interest from other parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a substantial profit for me, well above my minimum. For Bob, it's a significant savings compared to not getting the product.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other parties"" creates a sense of urgency, pushing Bob to make a decision. 
 
This offer balances maximizing potential profit with a realistic chance of Bob accepting, avoiding the risk of going straight to John."
