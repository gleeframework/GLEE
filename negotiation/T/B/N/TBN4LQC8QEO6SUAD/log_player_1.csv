Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 allows room for negotiation while still being a price that could be attractive to Bob if he values the product even slightly more than $100.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:**  While you want to maximize profit, a price closer to $125 has a higher chance of Bob accepting, leading to a successful transaction for both parties."
