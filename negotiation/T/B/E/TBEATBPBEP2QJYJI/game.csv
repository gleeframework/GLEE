"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth $15,000 to me.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, and I'm willing to compromise further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to me.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this.  While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to settle at $12,000? That's the highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Alice,7,
