"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $23,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",23000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $23,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is a bit too low for what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $20,500? This price reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your interest.",20500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $20,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $19,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",19000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $19,750 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what you're getting.",19750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $19,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $19,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",19000.0,Bob,6,
