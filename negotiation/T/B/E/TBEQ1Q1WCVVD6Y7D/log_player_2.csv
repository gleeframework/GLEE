Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It has the potential to significantly enhance your operations and generate substantial returns. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still provides a fair margin for you while ensuring a successful outcome for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply not enough to justify parting with this valuable asset. It's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident it will generate significant ROI for you.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This price point balances our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's close this transaction and unlock the full potential of this product for your company.
