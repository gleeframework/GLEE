"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the starting point, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better price than $14,000, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  He can likely get the price down a bit further by making another counteroffer. There are still many rounds left, and it's worth trying to get closer to his ideal price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,500? I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this price reflects its value fairly."", ""product_price"": 12500}
