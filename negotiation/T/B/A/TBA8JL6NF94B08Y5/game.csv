"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the starting point, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,500? I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this price reflects its value fairly.",12500.0,Bob,4,
