"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident it will be a huge asset to your business.  Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value while working for my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that considers your budget while still allowing me to get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $1,175,000?  That feels like a good middle ground where we both feel like we're getting a reasonable deal.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise.  I believe this price reflects the product's value while still being within your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're close to a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer. I believe it's more than fair, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
