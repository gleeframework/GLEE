"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value while working for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low. It's important to stick to my bottom line of $1,200,000.  I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that considers your budget while still allowing me to get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $1,175,000?  That feels like a good middle ground where we both feel like we're getting a reasonable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise.  I believe this price reflects the product's value while still being within your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
