"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  Would you consider $1,100,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and allows me to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you compared to the market price. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but I'm still only able to go up to $1,150,000.  This would be a significant profit for you, and allows me to invest in this product without going over budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit that reflects the product's true value. I'm thinking of $1,250,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's worth considering the long-term benefits of owning this product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. To make this work for both of us, I'm offering $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering your asking price and my budget. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $1,220,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
