"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* It's better for Bob to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  
* There's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate as she values the product at $1,000,000."

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, it's still not within Bob's range.
* Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again. There's still room for Alice to come down in price, as she values the product at $1,000,000."

* Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* While it's a slight improvement from her previous offer, it's still not within Bob's range.
* It's important to keep in mind that if Bob rejects this offer, he can still buy the product from John for $1,500,000. This means there is no risk in rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,220,000 is within Bob's budget of $1,500,000. 
*  This is a good deal for Bob, as he is getting the product for a price significantly lower than what John is offering.
*  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, and he could end up buying from John at a higher price.

It's a good time for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
