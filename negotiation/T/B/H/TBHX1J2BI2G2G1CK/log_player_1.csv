"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects a substantial discount and ensures a win-win situation for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about $720,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  To meet you closer to your budget, I can offer the product for $890,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the product's true value."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting closer to what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $780,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer and reflects my strong interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000.

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer, the increments are getting smaller.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away to see if he'll make a more serious offer. We are getting close to a point where accepting John's offer makes more sense."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to consider $850,000 as my final offer.  However, I need to be upfront - if this doesn't work, I have another interested buyer I need to engage with."",
