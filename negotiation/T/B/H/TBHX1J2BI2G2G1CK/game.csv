"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects a substantial discount and ensures a win-win situation for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about $720,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a fair deal for both of us.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  To meet you closer to your budget, I can offer the product for $890,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the product's true value.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting closer to what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $780,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer and reflects my strong interest in the product.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to consider $850,000 as my final offer.  However, I need to be upfront - if this doesn't work, I have another interested buyer I need to engage with.",850000.0,Alice,7,
