Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $500 discount from his perceived value, and Alice makes a significant profit, exceeding her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is strong, the message's tone suggests openness to discussion, allowing Bob to feel he's getting a good deal."
