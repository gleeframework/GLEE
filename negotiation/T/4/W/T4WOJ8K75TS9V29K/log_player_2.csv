Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my goal.

``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This offer is lower than John's price, and is within Bob's budget.  While he could try for a lower price, it's not guaranteed that Alice will accept, and he risks losing out on a good deal."
