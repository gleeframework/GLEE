"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll propose $12,500. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $12,500 is a significant profit above your minimum price of $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal quickly avoids further time and effort spent on negotiation.
