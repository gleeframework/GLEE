"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to you, and I'm still getting a good price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can aim for a lower price, saving more money. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. This would still be a good profit for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, as it's under his $10,000 limit.  While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, there's a risk Alice might reject the next offer and it's likely she won't budge much further. Accepting this offer guarantees Bob a good price for the product, saving him $1,000 compared to buying from John."
