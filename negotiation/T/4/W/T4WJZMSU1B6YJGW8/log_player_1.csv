**Reasoning:**

Bob is very consistently sticking to a price ceiling around his perceived value of $800,000. While he's showing a willingness to negotiate, the increments are getting smaller.  It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds to reach a point that's significantly better than John's guaranteed $1,000,000.  It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed profit."
