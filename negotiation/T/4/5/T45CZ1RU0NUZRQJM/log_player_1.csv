Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit. While she has a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, selling to Bob for a higher price would be ideal.

**The Challenge:** Alice doesn't know how much Bob is willing to pay, only that the product is worth $800,000 to him.

**The Strategy:**  Alice should aim for a price slightly below Bob's perceived value to make it attractive while still maximizing her potential profit.

**The Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. I know its value to someone like you, so I'm proposing a price of $790,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 790000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically aims to justify the high price.
* **Price:**  The price of $790,000 is just below Bob's $800,000 valuation. This makes it highly likely Bob will accept, as it offers him a good deal on something he values. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
