Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $70 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $87. It's a fantastic product and well worth that price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $80 for this product. How about we split the difference and call it $81? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $80, and at $81, this is a reasonable deal.  It's better to accept and save $19 than risk her walking away and having to pay John $100."
