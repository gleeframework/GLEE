Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" you're subtly implying that the product is worth this higher price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  By showing flexibility and willingness to discuss, you keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. This avoids an immediate rejection and keeps the door open for a deal. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have a backup buyer, it's strategically better to avoid mentioning John.  This keeps the focus on Bob as your primary target and avoids potentially lowering his perceived value of the product."
