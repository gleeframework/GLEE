{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start high and see if I can get closer to Bob's value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $10,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we go with $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd still prefer a bit more, $10,250 is a good price.  It's significantly better than selling to John and close enough to my ideal price that it's worth accepting.  It's time to close the deal!"
