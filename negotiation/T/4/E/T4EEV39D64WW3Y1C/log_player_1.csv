Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to earn as much as possible, so she starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob, should he counter-offer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John. Therefore, she shouldn't go below that price.

By starting high but not unreasonably so, Alice gives herself the best chance to get the highest price possible from Bob while still having John as a backup option."
