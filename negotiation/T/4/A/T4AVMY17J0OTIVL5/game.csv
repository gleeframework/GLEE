"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175. This still gives me a fair price, and it's a significant discount from my original offer.  What do you say?",175.0,Alice,3,
