"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $850,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $750,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his desired price point.  Bob has a better alternative with John, who is offering the product for $800,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and potentially counteroffering again or buying from John makes more sense."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. While I'm happy to see you moving closer to my price point, $825,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $775,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 775000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $790,000 for the product.  This is a good deal for both of us and allows us to finalize this transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $790,000 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $800,000. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially losing the deal entirely is high. Accepting Alice's offer at this point is the most logical choice for Bob."
