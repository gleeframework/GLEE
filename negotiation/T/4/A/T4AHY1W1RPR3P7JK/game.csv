"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for the product. Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $8,500. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about $7,750?  That's a significant move from my last offer.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $7,750. How about we settle on $8,250? This is my final offer.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,250 is still a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to meet in the middle at $8,000.  This would be a fair deal, as it's the actual value of the product to you.  What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,6,
