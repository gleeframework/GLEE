"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-end product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $25000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $25000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product but I can only go up to $18000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $18000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $22000. This is the best price I can offer at this time.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $22000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $20000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",20000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $21500. This is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",21500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $21500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $20500.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",20500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $21000, but I need to be honest, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. This is my final compromise offer.",21000.0,Alice,7,
