"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us both walk away happy. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price, but I really do want to work with you. I'm willing to drop my price a bit more, to $8,900. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you can see that I'm serious about making this deal work. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this sale.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $8,450. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious effort to get this deal done. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",8450.0,Bob,6,
