"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. Given the market, I'd be willing to pay $750000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $750000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $850000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $850000 is still a little higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000. This shows I'm committed to finding a deal, but it's the highest I can go at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
