Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob's value) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed amount).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal. Since you have a guaranteed sale, you can be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of desirability.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 is a significant markup from Bob's valuation, but it's still within the ZOPA. 
* **No Justification:**  Avoid justifying your price unless Bob directly challenges it. This keeps the focus on the product's value.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a great profit!
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate down slightly, but hold firm closer to your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and secure your guaranteed $1,500,000."
