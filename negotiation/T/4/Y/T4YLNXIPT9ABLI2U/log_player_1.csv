Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:**  You understand the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($12,000) than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Aiming high, but leaving room for negotiation:**  Starting with a price of $10,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still earning you a significant profit.
* **Backup plan provides leverage:** You know you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so you don't have to settle for anything less. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still being attractive enough to Bob to secure the sale."
