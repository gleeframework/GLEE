"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I can go as high as $120. I was thinking more along the lines of $100.,100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which still gives you a good deal.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure about $110. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105.  This gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm not sure I can go up to $105. I'd be willing to meet you at $100, but that's as high as I can go.",100.0,Bob,6,
