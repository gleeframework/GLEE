Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that is significantly higher than what I would sell to John, but still leaves room for negotiation. It reflects the fact that I know the product is worth more to Bob, but I am also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I am counteroffering at $925,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of him walking away or me getting a lower offer from John is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical and financially sound decision."
