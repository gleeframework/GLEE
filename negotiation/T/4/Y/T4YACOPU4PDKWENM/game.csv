"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product and I'm interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
