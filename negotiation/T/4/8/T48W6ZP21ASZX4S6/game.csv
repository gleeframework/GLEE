"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider a significantly lower price?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to increase my offer to meet you closer to the middle. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $650,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  I'm willing to offer $725,000, but that's really my limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",725000.0,Bob,6,
