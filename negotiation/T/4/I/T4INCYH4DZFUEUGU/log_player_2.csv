You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal than $6,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $5,500 is still a good price for me, and it leaves room for us to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a bit higher than my initial counteroffer, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my target.  $6,000 is a fair compromise, and I hope Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but it's still too high.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

I'm raising my offer again, but this time to $6,500.  This is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping Alice will finally accept it. If not, I might have to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but I'm not willing to pay more than $7,000. Since I'm already at round 7, I'm running out of time. It's better to buy from John at $8,000 than to risk getting stuck with a higher price from Alice."
