"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $120 to you!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to pay closer to $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $95 is still below Bob's maximum value of $120, making it a good deal for him.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and the deal might fall through.
* **John's Offer:**  Accepting Alice's offer is a significantly better deal than buying from John for $120.

Therefore, accepting the offer at $95 is the most prudent choice for Bob."
