"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's well above my minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I'm confident I can get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with a price of $100. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still leaves room for a profitable deal. I believe this price is fair, considering Bob values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's significantly better than selling to John.  I'm running out of rounds, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  $95 is a good compromise, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
