"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic in negotiations to start with an offer that's favorable to you. This leaves room for negotiation and doesn't immediately anchor Alice to a price near her asking price.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's perspective, but clearly states my position and desired price. 
* **Strategic Aim:** My goal is to buy for under $1,200,000.  This offer gives some room to negotiate upwards while still potentially getting a significantly better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching My Limit:** Alice's offer now matches my absolute maximum budget. There's no room for negotiation to get a better price from Alice.
* **Equal to John's Offer:**  John is offering the product at the same price. 
* **No Benefit to Delaying:**  Continuing negotiations with Alice has no upside at this point, and it risks losing the product if she decides to walk away."
