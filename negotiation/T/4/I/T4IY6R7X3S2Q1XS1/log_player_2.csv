"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's still a fair price for both of us, given the product's value. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

""product_price"": 11500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. $11,500 is closer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would give us both a fair deal, and we can move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but there's still room for negotiation. Alice is willing to move down from her initial offer, so there's a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  Let's settle this right now. How about $12,000 even? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

We're aiming for that sweet spot where Alice gets her minimum and we don't overpay. By round 6, it's worth taking a calculated risk to close the deal."
