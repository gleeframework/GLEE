"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to make you a one-time offer to purchase the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a discount from her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the door to getting a better deal."
