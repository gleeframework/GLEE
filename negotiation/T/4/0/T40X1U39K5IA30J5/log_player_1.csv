Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 4

We're still significantly below my minimum.  It's time to nudge Bob closer to a price that makes continuing the negotiation worthwhile."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I respect your budget constraints.  However, $13,000 undervalues the product's features and benefits.  To find a middle ground, I propose $16,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures you receive exceptional value."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a fair offer considering we're both making concessions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to move significantly higher, and we're running out of rounds.  It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
