Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to reduce my price to $850,000, reflecting the value you'll gain from this product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and should be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.
