Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I am willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,300,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this price is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. John's offer is a safe bet, guaranteeing me my minimum profit. I'm going to sell to John."
