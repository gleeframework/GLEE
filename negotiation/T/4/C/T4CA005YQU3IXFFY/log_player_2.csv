"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After considering your potential interest and the market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's lower than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's still a significant gap between Alice's value ($800,000) and your maximum ($1,500,000)."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While she's moved closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and she's willing to sell for as low as $800,000, so there's a large range where you could potentially strike a deal.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again allows you to continue pushing for a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $885000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $885,000, which is only $35,000 more than your last counter-offer of $850,000.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to further concessions from Alice, but at a slower pace. Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product at a price that's within your budget and significantly lower than John's price."
