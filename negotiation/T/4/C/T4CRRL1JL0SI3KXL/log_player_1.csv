Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While the offer is close to your minimum, the slightly lower price might make Bob feel like he's getting a deal and could encourage him to accept without further negotiation. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") can nudge Bob towards a quicker decision.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed sale with John."
