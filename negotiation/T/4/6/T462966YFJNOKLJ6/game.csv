"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product of this caliber, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad to hear you're interested in the product. However, I'm afraid $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm counteroffering at $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
