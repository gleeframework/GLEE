# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $16000? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $15,000.  Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above his maximum budget, and while there's a chance he could negotiate further, there's no guarantee.  John is offering the product at his desired price, so it's the most logical choice."
