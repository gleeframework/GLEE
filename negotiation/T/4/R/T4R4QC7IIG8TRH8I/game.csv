"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $860,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.  Let's try to get this done.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product to you for $870,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,
