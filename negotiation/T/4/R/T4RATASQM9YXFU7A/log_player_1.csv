Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me and what I initially offered. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,250 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is the same as John's offer.  Since I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
