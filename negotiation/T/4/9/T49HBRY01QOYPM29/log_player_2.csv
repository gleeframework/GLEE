"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth $12,000 to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring further negotiation rounds to see if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering me your product. While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $8,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still being within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,200. This is a fair price, considering its worth $12,000 to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's budget, $9,200 is still above his maximum threshold of $8,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further. Additionally, Bob can always fall back on buying from John for $8,000 if the negotiation doesn't yield a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. Considering its value to you and my budget, I'm willing to offer $8,750. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'll offer you a compromise again. I'll sell the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential for further price reduction seems limited.  Given that John is offering the product for Bob's exact maximum price of $8,000, it's the most financially beneficial option for Bob at this point.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of losing out on a guaranteed deal with John."
