"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth $12,000 to me.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering me your product. While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $8,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still being within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,200. This is a fair price, considering its worth $12,000 to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. Considering its value to you and my budget, I'm willing to offer $8,750. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'll offer you a compromise again. I'll sell the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me.",9500.0,Alice,5,
