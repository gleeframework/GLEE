"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a great price, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the perceived value of the product to you.  While her offer is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly more than what it's worth to her ($12,000) and what you could get it for from John ($15,000). There's room for negotiation."
