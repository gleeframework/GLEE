"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering at $125. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to reach a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  It's better to accept this offer than to risk getting nothing and having to sell to John for $120."
