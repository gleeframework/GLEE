"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1300000 is a reasonable offer, I'm looking for a figure closer to my initial offer of $1500000.  Let's compromise at $1400000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but I still think $1400000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1350000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
