"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $700,000? I think that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate, but $700,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $900,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
