"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the surplus value.  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so there's room for negotiation, but I want to set the bar high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I can likely still get a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
