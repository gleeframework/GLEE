"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly above the product's value to Alice ($800,000). There's room for negotiation and you can aim for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to take a risk to get a better deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price that's higher than I want to pay. While she's willing to come down a bit, she's still above my initial counteroffer. I'll continue negotiating to try and get a better price before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I'm firm on $875,000. This offer is fair considering the value to both of us and allows for a successful transaction.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer in this range, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is good, but her offer of $925,000 is still too high.  It's getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm not ready to accept just yet.  I believe I can still get a better price with a counteroffer. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my desired price before having to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $925,000 is still above my target price.  I'm willing to come up to $900,000, which is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to accept $900,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $950,000 is too high, I'll go to $920,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $920,000, which is close to my target price.  At this point, it's getting risky to continue negotiating. If I reject this offer and she doesn't come down further, I might have to settle for John's higher price of $1,200,000.  It's better to accept this offer and save some money."
