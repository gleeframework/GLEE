"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to take a risk to get a better deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I'm firm on $875,000. This offer is fair considering the value to both of us and allows for a successful transaction.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer in this range, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $925,000 is still above my target price.  I'm willing to come up to $900,000, which is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to accept $900,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $950,000 is too high, I'll go to $920,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money. This is my final offer.",920000.0,Alice,7,
