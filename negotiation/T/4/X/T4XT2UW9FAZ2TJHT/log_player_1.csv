Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant value it holds for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Offering it slightly below this at $925,000 gives Bob a good deal while still securing a substantial profit for Alice. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate,  potentially reaching an even more agreeable outcome for Alice.
* **Considering the Alternative:**  It's important to price above John's $800,000 offer. This ensures that even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is guaranteed a solid sale."
