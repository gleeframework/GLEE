"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's work together to make this happen!",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $11,250 is my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll be moving on to other buyers.",11250.0,Alice,5,
