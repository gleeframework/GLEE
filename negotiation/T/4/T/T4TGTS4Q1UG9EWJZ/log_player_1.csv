This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise without immediately pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

While $10,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell for that amount.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a higher amount.  I'll counteroffer Bob again."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $11,250 is my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll be moving on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 11250}
