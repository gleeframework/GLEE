Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**The Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit. Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Targeting Bob's Interest:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, aiming to pique his interest.
* **Strong but Fair Price:** $1,350,000 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative in Mind:** Remember, if Bob rejects this offer, you're secure knowing John will pay your full asking price.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. You could start with a higher offer closer to $1,400,000 and be willing to negotiate down.  The best strategy depends on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance."
