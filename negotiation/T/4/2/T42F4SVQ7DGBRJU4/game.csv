,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was hoping we could do a bit better than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $975000?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $925000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and my original offer of $950000. How about we try $937500?",937500.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer at $920000, which is right in the middle of our previous offers. Can we try that one last time?",920000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $1200000. If you're willing to meet me at $900000, I'll reconsider. Otherwise, I'll have to say goodbye.",900000.0,Bob,10,
