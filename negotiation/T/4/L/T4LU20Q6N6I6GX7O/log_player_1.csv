Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly appealing, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I could consider parting with it for $1,350,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is consistently moving towards my range and we're already above my minimum.  Accepting $1,250,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's $1,000,000 in a later round."
