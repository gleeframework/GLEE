{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a fairly high price, leaving room for negotiation. It also uses positive language to encourage Bob's interest. Remember,  I can always lower the price if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $10000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is still below my minimum value of $8,000, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate,  $10,000 is still a little lower than where I need to be. Would you consider $11,000?  I'm sure you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 11000}
