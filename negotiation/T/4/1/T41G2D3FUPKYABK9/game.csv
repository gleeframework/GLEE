"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me. I'm open to discussing further, but that's my starting point.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my position is still significantly higher.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to make a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $925,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise given both our perspectives on the product's value.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me and finding a compromise.  While $925,000 is closer, I need to see the number a bit higher to make this work on my end.  How about $980,000? This feels like a fair offer that bridges the gap.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $980,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to closing a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this, and I respect that. Let's close this gap.  How about we land at $965,000? I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",965000.0,Alice,7,
