"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me. I'm open to discussing further, but that's my starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
This is a low offer, but there's still room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get Bob to come up considerably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my position is still significantly higher.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to make a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Significant but not drastic reduction:**  We've dropped $75,000, showing willingness to negotiate, but we're not getting too close to our walk-away point just yet.
* **Holding firm above $1 million:**  This keeps the perceived value high and avoids setting a precedent for going too low.
* **Encouraging a counter:** The message is framed to prompt Bob to make a move upward, hopefully closing the gap faster."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $925,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise given both our perspectives on the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While closer, we're still a significant amount away from our minimum. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get Bob closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me and finding a compromise.  While $925,000 is closer, I need to see the number a bit higher to make this work on my end.  How about $980,000? This feels like a fair offer that bridges the gap."", 
""product_price"": 980000
}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made another significant concession ($45,000) to show we're serious about closing the deal.
* **Shifting the Middle Ground:** By countering with $980,000, we're shifting the perception of a ""fair compromise"" closer to our desired range. 
* **Testing Bob's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will reveal how much Bob is truly willing to budge. If he's stuck at $925,000, we might need to consider our alternatives."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $980,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to closing a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're getting close, but at this stage, every bit counts.  Let's try for one more push to close the gap. $950,000 is still a significant way from our minimum, and we have some room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this, and I respect that. Let's close this gap.  How about we land at $965,000? I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 965000
}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Final Push:** This offer splits the difference while staying firm above $960,000. It shows a strong desire to close while not caving in completely. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting we ""close this gap,"" we add a bit of urgency, hoping to nudge Bob toward a final decision.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We're getting close to a point where accepting John's offer might be the more profitable decision. This offer leaves us some room to potentially go even lower, but we're nearing our limit."
