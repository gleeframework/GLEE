"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is far above his budget, and he can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me. I'm open to discussing further, but that's my starting point."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my position is still significantly higher.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,025,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's preferred budget. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $925,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise given both our perspectives on the product's value."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me and finding a compromise.  While $925,000 is closer, I need to see the number a bit higher to make this work on my end.  How about $980,000? This feels like a fair offer that bridges the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $980,000 is closer to his budget, he should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. He still has time left and can use it to his advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $980,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to closing a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this, and I respect that. Let's close this gap.  How about we land at $965,000? I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's already negotiated down to a price that's very close to his budget, and with only 3 rounds remaining, he risks not finding a better deal. It's a good time to close the deal and avoid the risk of losing out on the product altogether."
