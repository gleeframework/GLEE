Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe could significantly benefit you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its intrinsic worth."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price from John creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **High Perceived Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While my first offer is strong, there's some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. This keeps the door open for me to potentially secure an even better deal."
