"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's truly valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by counteroffering.  He has room to negotiate since his maximum price is $12,000 and Alice's minimum is likely closer to $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  He can likely get it lower with another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering I'm ready to purchase now."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value to you. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a maximum budget of $12,000.  Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's limit, and further negotiation may result in a price closer to that limit, leaving Bob with very little margin for profit.  At this point, it is more prudent for Bob to buy from John for $12,000, ensuring he gets the product while staying within his budget."
