**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $950,000, and the product is worth $800,000 to her.** This means she's making a good profit.
* **You can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, and it's worth $1,000,000 to you.** This means you're getting a fair deal with John, even though you're not getting a discount.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to negotiate with her further or potentially find a better deal elsewhere.**  You're not obligated to buy from her, and you're in a position to wait and see if you can get a better price."
