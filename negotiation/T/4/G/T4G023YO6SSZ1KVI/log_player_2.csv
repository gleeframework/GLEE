"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice will accept a counteroffer, saving you some money. If she doesn't, you can always buy from John for your maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your maximum price. By offering this, you signal your willingness to buy, while still ensuring you don't overspend. Alice has the option to accept, or counter with a price closer to your limit, hopefully leading to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is within your budget.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice would lower the price again. Accepting her offer guarantees you get the product at a price slightly higher than your absolute limit, but still saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John.  The risk of further negotiation isn't worth the potential savings."
