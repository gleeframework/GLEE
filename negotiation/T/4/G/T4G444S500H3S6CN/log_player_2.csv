"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can save $50,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. While there's no guarantee Alice will accept, it's worth trying to negotiate further. You can always resort to buying from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $715,000 is still a good deal compared to buying from John for $800,000. You've already saved $85,000 from the initial price, and further negotiation might not yield a significant enough difference to justify the risk of losing the deal."
