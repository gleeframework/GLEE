"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss the possibility of meeting at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget considerations, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can we discuss the possibility of meeting at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
