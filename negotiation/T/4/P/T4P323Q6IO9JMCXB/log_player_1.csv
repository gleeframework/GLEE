Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""amazing product"" and ""appreciate its value"" to try and pique Bob's interest.
* **Open-ended Question:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and gives him the opportunity to counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting high gives me the best chance of getting a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** Bob's response will give me a sense of his willingness to pay.
* **Initiate a Negotiation:**  I'm creating a dialogue that will allow us to find a mutually acceptable price.

Remember, if Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and my desire to avoid selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than selling to John for $100, it's still below my desired price point.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** I'm starting by acknowledging Bob's offer, showing that I'm taking his perspective into consideration.
* **Compromise Language:**  I'm using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise"" to emphasize that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Specific Counteroffer:**  I'm making a concrete counteroffer of $135, which is a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show Flexibility:** By meeting Bob halfway, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain My Position:** I'm still pushing for a price higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my original asking price.
* **Increase the Chances of a Deal:**  By proposing a specific number, I'm encouraging Bob to either accept the offer or make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I think $125 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's also only a small difference from my previous counteroffer.  Considering the possibility of selling to John for $100, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale for $125.  While I might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out, the risk of losing the deal altogether isn't worth it."
