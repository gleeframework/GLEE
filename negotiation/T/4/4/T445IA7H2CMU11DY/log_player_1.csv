Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it provides significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  Going too low initially might make Bob think the product is worth less or offend him.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $11,500 is a significant profit over the $8,000 John would pay."
