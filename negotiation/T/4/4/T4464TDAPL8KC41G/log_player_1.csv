Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $11,500 gives Bob a good deal while still securing a significant profit for you. This leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a deal with the buyer who values the product most."
