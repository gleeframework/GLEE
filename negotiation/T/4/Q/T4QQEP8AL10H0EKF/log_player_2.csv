"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's not a good deal for me. It makes more sense to reject the offer and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is a reasonable compromise. It's important for me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $10,500 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  Since she's stated this is her final offer, it's not worth continuing to negotiate. It makes more sense to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring I get the best price and stay within my budget."
