"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $975,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
