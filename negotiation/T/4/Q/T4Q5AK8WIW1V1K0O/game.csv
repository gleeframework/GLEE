"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,500,000. This is a unique product with high demand, so I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,500,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must adhere to my budgetary constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations while still respecting my financial limitations.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation. How about we settle at $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your continued negotiation. I've done some further research and am now able to offer $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with your valuation while still respecting my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
