"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $850,000? This price still gives you a great deal, considering the product's value to your business. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,
