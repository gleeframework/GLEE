# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its worth to you, we propose a price of $135. We're confident this price reflects both the value of the product and your interest in it. Let us know if this works for you, or if you need any further information. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so there's no need to pay $135. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or find a better deal elsewhere."
