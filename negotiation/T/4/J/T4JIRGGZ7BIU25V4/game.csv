"I'm very interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $18000, and I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'm not going any lower than that. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $13500, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the price, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",14000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one last offer: $17000, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",17000.0,Alice,9,
