"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll be happy with this price, and I look forward to hearing back from you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $8000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10000.
