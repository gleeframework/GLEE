You can do better than $950,000.  Reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer."

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still above her minimum value. This will allow for some room for negotiation while still saving you a good amount of money."

Alice's offer is still higher than you'd like. Reject and counteroffer again."

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying below her initial offer. It also keeps you well below John's price, making this negotiation still worthwhile."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000

Alice is getting closer to your maximum price, and it's likely she won't go lower. Buying from John, while more expensive, guarantees you get the product and avoids further negotiation."
