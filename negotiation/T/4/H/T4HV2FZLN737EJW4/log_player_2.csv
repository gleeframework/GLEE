You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than Bob's valuation. It's better for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
