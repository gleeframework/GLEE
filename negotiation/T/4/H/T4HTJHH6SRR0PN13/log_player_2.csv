At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. You've already negotiated a significant price reduction from her initial offer, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. It's unlikely you'll be able to get a price lower than $850,000 from Alice, and buying from John for $1,500,000 is a much worse deal."
