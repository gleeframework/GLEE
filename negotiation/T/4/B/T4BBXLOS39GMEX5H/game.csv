"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $925,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to consider a price of $935,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",935000.0,Alice,5,
