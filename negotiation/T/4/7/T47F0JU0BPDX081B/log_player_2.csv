"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a very competitive price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant value proposition, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would allow us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let's find a middle ground and make this happen.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's make this happen.

Since I was going to reject her offer, I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. Here it is:

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000. I'm still thinking $900,000 is a fair price. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
