I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This is the price I'd get from John, so I'm not willing to go lower unless Bob offers a very compelling counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $11,000. This is still a good deal for me, and I hope it's attractive enough for Bob to consider."
