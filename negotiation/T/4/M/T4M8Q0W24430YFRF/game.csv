"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $140 and $100. How about we try $130? It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with it.",130.0,Alice,5,
