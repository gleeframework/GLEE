,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll let it go for $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $85 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $80.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,4,
