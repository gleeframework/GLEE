"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be polite and express continued interest:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages negotiation.
* **Start low:** By offering $100, we leave room for negotiation.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it gives us a starting point.
* **Avoid revealing our maximum budget:**  We don't want to show our hand too early."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to an acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. We'll try one more time to see if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we settle at $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Acknowledge Alice's move:**  We recognize her willingness to negotiate by thanking her.
* **Propose a compromise:** $115  is a midpoint between our previous offer and her current one, signaling a desire to find agreement.
* **Frame it as a win-win:** By calling it a ""fair compromise,"" we encourage Alice to see it positively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $125, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that she's unlikely to go much lower. At $125, we're getting a good deal compared to John's $150 price. It's time to accept and secure the product."
