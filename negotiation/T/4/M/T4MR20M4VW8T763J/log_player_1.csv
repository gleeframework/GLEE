Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob declines, so this is your fallback position.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair price for such a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident Language:** Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair price"" subtly anchor the value in Bob's mind.
* **Focus on Value:**  Don't dwell on specific features. Instead, emphasize the overall ""value"" and ""potential"" to appeal to Bob's desire for a good deal.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Key:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You might need to be flexible to close the deal, but always keep your $1,500,000 minimum in mind.
* **Relationship Matters:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important (e.g., for future business), you might adjust your strategy to be slightly less aggressive."
