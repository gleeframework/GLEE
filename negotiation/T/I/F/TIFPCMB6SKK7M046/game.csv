"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the initial price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is tempting, I'm aiming for something closer to $2,100,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  I'm open to exploring options within this range to find a solution that works for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $2,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances the value of the product with my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
