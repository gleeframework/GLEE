# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which holds immense value for us at $1,200,000. Given its significance and the potential it holds for you, I would like to extend an exclusive offer. We are willing to consider a negotiation, but our starting point is $950,000. This price reflects the quality, exclusivity, and the strategic advantage this product can bring to your endeavors. Let's discuss how we can make this deal beneficial for both parties. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Bob's goal is to save money, and rejecting Alice's offer allows him to buy from John for a lower price."
