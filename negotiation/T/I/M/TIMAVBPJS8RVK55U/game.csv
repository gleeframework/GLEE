"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750000.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but that's as high as I can go. I really believe this product is valuable, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775000.
