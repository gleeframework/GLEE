"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to make a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
