"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  which is still a significant discount from my original asking price.  This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $812,500. This offer is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let's reach a deal that benefits both of us.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
