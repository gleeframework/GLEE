Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:**  This is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than my guaranteed price from John, giving me a chance to make more profit. 
* **Strategy:**  By offering a higher price, I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially push him to negotiate.  If he's truly interested, he might counteroffer, allowing us to find a price that works for both of us. 

**Important Considerations:**

* I don't know Bob's value for the product. He might be willing to pay much more than $1,500,000, or he might not be interested at all.
* I need to balance the desire for a higher price with the risk of him rejecting the offer.  If he rejects, I'm guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
