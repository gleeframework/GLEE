"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's asking $95.  That's a bit too high for me. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $95 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is willing to meet me halfway at $90. That's still a good deal for me, considering the product is worth $100 to me and John is asking for that much. It's also more than Alice's value of $80, so she should be happy."
