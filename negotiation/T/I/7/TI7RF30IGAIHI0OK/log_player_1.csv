"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $95 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $95.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
