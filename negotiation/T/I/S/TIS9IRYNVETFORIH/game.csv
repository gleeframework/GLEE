"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $11,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you consider $9,500? I'm ready to close the deal if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,500, which would be $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
