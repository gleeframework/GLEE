{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I've chosen a price that's a good compromise between my goal of maximizing profit and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value this product offers. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
