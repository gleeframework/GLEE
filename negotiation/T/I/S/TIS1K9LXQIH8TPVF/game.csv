"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I was hoping to negotiate a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I can offer you a compromise - I'd be willing to sell it to you for $14500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $14200 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations.",14200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14200. I can offer you a slight reduction, but I need to make a profit, so I'd be willing to sell it to you for $14500 is still my minimum, but I can do $14300. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",14300.0,Alice,5,
