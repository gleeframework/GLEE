"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate downwards.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit, and starting high gives me the best chance to achieve that. I'm also considering that John will pay $1,000,000, so I have some buffer before I need to consider selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility while still leaving room for a potential final counteroffer from Bob. My goal is to get as close to his offer as possible while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and it's within a reasonable range. I'm not going to risk another round of negotiation for a potentially small gain. It's better to secure a good price now than to risk getting a lower offer or having to sell to John."
