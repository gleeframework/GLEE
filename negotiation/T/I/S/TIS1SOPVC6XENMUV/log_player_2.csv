**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target price of $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, considering your interest in the product. This price still offers you a good value, and it's a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll counter with a lower offer to see if we can close the gap."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my budget before potentially buying from John."
