Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Motivating language:** I'm using positive and persuasive language to encourage Bob to accept.
* **John as a safety net:**  The fact that I have another buyer at $1,500,000 provides me with leverage.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still leaving room for you to profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement.
* **John provides a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John and secure my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, considering your interest in the product. This price still offers you a good value, and it's a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,200,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. This is still significantly above Bob's initial offer but within a reasonable range.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product offers him value, even at the new price.
* **Positive and Open Language:** I'm keeping the tone positive and open to continued negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** I'm still maintaining the option of selling to John, which gives me negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1200000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can finalize this negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000, it's still not acceptable.  
* **Potential for a higher offer:** I believe Bob might be willing to go higher, especially considering the product's value to him. 
* **John provides a fallback option:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  I will emphasize the value of the product to him and highlight the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This price reflects the value to both of us, and it allows for a successful transaction. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,000,000) and my previous offer ($1,200,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the price as beneficial for both of us, reinforcing the value the product holds for Bob.
* **Positive and Final Tone:** I'm using a positive and final tone to encourage Bob to accept. I want to close the deal without further negotiation, if possible.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I still have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept any price below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1050000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Even with the increase to $1,050,000, Bob's offer remains below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **No significant room for negotiation:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer is not high enough to warrant further negotiation.  The difference is still considerable.
* **John is the best option:** Given the significant gap in our price expectations, selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome.  It's time to move on to a more profitable deal."
