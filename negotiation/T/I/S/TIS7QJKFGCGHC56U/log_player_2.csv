Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $1080000. This is as close to your target as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is close to Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price significantly lower than buying from John, achieving Bob's goal of saving money."
