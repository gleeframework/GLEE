**Explanation:**

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price.

```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1125000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is a reasonable price for Bob.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to compromise and the price could go back up.  Furthermore, Bob only has 5 rounds left, and there's no guarantee that he can get a lower price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, saving him $375,000 compared to buying from John."
