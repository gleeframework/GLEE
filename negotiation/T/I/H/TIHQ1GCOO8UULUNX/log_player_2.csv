"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're interested. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than what Bob would pay John, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, saving him $200,000."
