{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to your business.  My initial offer is $1,150,000. I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Can you consider meeting me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I believe $1,100,000 is a bit too low for this unique product. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This still allows me to achieve a fair profit, while also offering you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000, but I'd like to see if we can meet at an even lower price. Can you consider going down to $1080000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum,  I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further, as it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000, but I'd like to see if we can meet at an even lower price. Can you consider going down to $1000000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum.  However, I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, he will keep lowering his counteroffers, and I may end up losing out.  It's better to accept John's offer of $1,000,000 and ensure a sale.  I've learned that it's important to be willing to walk away from a deal if the price isn't right, even if it means taking a slightly lower profit.  I will use this experience to be more assertive in future negotiations and set firm boundaries for my minimum acceptable price."
