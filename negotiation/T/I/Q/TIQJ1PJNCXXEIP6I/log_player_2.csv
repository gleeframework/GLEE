"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand its value to you is unknown, so I'm offering it at a price that reflects its potential while still being attractive. I'm asking $900000 for it. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe you'd be the perfect fit for this product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
