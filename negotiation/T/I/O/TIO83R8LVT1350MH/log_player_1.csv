Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I believe it offers exceptional value at this price."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering my absolute minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of reaching a better outcome. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price without further hassle."
