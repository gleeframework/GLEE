Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $1,500,000, so anything less than that is not acceptable.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, meaning he has a lot of room to negotiate.
* **Initial offer:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,400,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's valuation. This leaves space for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a good deal.
* **Alternative:** I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price, giving me confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low. 

This strategy aims to:

*  Maximize my potential profit by starting with a high price.
*  Give Bob incentive to negotiate, knowing he can get the product for less than my minimum.
*  Protect my interests by having a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:** It's significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000 and even lower than his own valuation of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there is still potential for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to hold firm and reject Bob's low offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I am serious about getting a fair price for the product and keep the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:**  My previous offer of $1,400,000 was rejected, so I'm showing flexibility by lowering the price. However, I'm still significantly above Bob's initial offer.
* **Finding a middle ground:** A price of $1,200,000 is a compromise. It's more appealing to Bob than my previous offer, but still provides a substantial profit for me.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation. If Bob accepts, I secure a good deal. If he rejects, I can adjust the price again in subsequent rounds.

This strategy aims to:

*  Show willingness to compromise, keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.
*  Position myself to potentially achieve a price closer to my ideal value.
*  Maintain leverage by having John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's higher than his initial offer of $800,000, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There is still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually beneficial price closer to my minimum.
* **John provides security:** I have a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price, which gives me the confidence to hold firm and reject Bob's offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair price. This keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finding common ground:** Bob's offer is slowly increasing, and I'm responding by lowering my price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Staying above my minimum:** Even with this lower offer, I'm still above my minimum value of $1,500,000, ensuring I'm not losing money.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  I'm not going to accept anything less than my minimum, so Bob needs to come up with a better offer if he wants to close the deal.

This counteroffer aims to:

*  Keep Bob motivated to find a price closer to my desired value.
*  Signal that I'm willing to negotiate but also stand firm on my principles.
*  Maintain leverage by having John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum:**  Even though Bob is increasing his offer, it's still not close to my minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a long and drawn-out process with no guarantee of reaching a favorable outcome.
* **John offers certainty and a better price:**  I have a reliable buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. This offers a secure and profitable transaction.

Selling to John at this point is the most sensible option. It guarantees I get my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
