"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering $1,300,000 as a final counteroffer. This price still allows me to make a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise given your needs.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $1,250,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy with the deal. What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,275,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
