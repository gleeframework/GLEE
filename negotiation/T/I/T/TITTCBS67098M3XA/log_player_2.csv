"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $14,000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going with John.  $14,000 is still above your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and my ability to purchase it elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To accommodate your needs while still valuing the product appropriately, I am willing to consider a price of $13,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering both the value of the product and your willingness to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $13,500 is getting closer to your budget, you can likely still negotiate a lower price. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad to hear that we're making progress, Bob. Considering your offer and the value of the product, I believe we can come to an agreement. I am willing to sell the product to you for $13,250. This price reflects the value of the product while also accommodating your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price point, but $13,250 is still more than what you're comfortable with.  Given the number of rounds left, it's probably a better strategy to buy from John at this point and secure the product for your target price."
