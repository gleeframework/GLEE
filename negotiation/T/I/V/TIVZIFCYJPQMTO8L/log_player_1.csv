Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I want to see if I can squeeze out some more profit. While the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium, knowing he values the product at $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hopeful I can get a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $9,500. This is closer to Bob's offer but still higher than what I'm willing to accept if I were to sell to John. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price point of $10,000, I'm confident that getting $9,000 is a good deal.  There's a chance Bob might reject a counteroffer, and if I keep rejecting, I risk losing him as a buyer entirely.  It's better to secure the deal now and ensure a profitable sale."
