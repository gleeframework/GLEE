Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is very low, but there's a risk he'll walk away if I counter too aggressively. I need to weigh the potential profit of holding out for more against the guaranteed $10,000 from John.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I value this product at.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you value the product highly, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident I can get good value from the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tempting offer from Bob, but I still think there's room for negotiation. I'm getting closer to John's price, but I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can edge Bob up a little higher.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I see you're serious about this product. How about we settle on $10,500? That's my final offer, as I have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
