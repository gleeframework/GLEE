"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation.  By offering above Bob's value, I can potentially get him to move closer to my desired price. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  The 10-round limit and John's offer of $1,500,000 provide me with a safety net. If the negotiations with Bob stall, I can always choose to sell to John and guarantee my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his willingness to negotiate. I believe there's still room for us to find a price that works for both parties. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,500,000, providing me with a safety net. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob yet. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired price point, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us. I will keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a fair price for a valuable product. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price of $1,400,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to remind him of its worth.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and cooperative tone to encourage Bob to accept my offer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to inch closer to my desired price point while remaining open to further negotiation. By offering a compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to see the value in reaching a deal with me rather than risking losing the opportunity to buy the product.  I'm still keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000 if these negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a significant financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Continues:** While Bob's offer is not acceptable, he is showing a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price point. This suggests further negotiation could lead to a better outcome.
* **John's Offer:** I am aware of John's offer of $1,500,000, but I believe there's still potential to reach a higher price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired price point but still acknowledges Bob's willingness to increase his offer.  I'll continue to be mindful of the possibility of selling to John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your efforts. While $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This price is fair to both parties, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:** I'm again demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $1,350,000 to $1,300,000. This shows a genuine desire to reach a deal.
* **Emphasizing the Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the opportunity he has to acquire it.
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""Let's find a solution"" and ""Let's close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm continuing to inch closer to Bob's price while keeping my own minimum in mind.  I believe $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see its value and accept my offer. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, but I will also be prepared to sell to John if the negotiations become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,225,000 remains below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a significant financial loss for me.
* **Progress Stalled:**  While Bob has increased his offer, the increments have become smaller, indicating that he might be reaching his limit.
* **John's Offer is Appealing:**  With only four rounds left, John's offer of $1,500,000 is becoming increasingly attractive as a safe and profitable option.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I need to move the negotiation closer to my target before John's offer becomes more appealing.  I'll need to be persuasive and highlight the value of the product to encourage Bob to come closer to my price. However, I'm aware that selling to John might be the most practical solution if we can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too low for me. I truly believe this product is worth more, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset in the long run. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product. I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if we both make a final push towards compromise."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm making a small compromise by lowering my price to $1,275,000. This shows that I'm still willing to negotiate but also emphasizes that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Value & Potential:** I'm highlighting the value and potential of the product to reinforce its worth in Bob's mind.
* **Final Push:**  I'm urging Bob to make a final push towards compromise, emphasizing that we're close to reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds left, I'm aiming to push the negotiation as close as possible to my desired price point. This offer is a significant step closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it still allows for some wiggle room if Bob is willing to increase his offer again. I am also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup option if Bob rejects this offer.  The pressure is increasing, and I'm looking for a final push to seal a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. He's indicated this is his maximum, so further negotiation is unlikely to result in a higher offer. 
* **Two Rounds Remaining:**  With only two rounds left, the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price is low. 
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay $1,500,000, guaranteeing my desired profit.  This is a much more secure and profitable option than continuing negotiations with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result.  Selling to John now ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation breakdowns in the remaining rounds.  While I would have preferred a higher price, it's essential to make a decision that maximizes my potential earnings while minimizing my risk."
