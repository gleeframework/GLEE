Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and I'm hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm aware that I can always fall back to John's offer of $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price than John's offer, I think I can still do better.  I'm confident in the product's value, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I'm trying to find a price that is fair to both of us and will hopefully lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $925,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to what I want. I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
