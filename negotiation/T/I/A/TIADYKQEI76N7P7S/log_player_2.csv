"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $800000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price Bob is willing to pay from John. There is potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, so it's best to reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is at least $800000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $800,000?  It's a fair price considering your value, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you at $825000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to me is at least $800000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,200,000 and John is selling the product for that price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a significantly higher price. Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal and secures the product."
