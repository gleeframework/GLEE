Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly downwards. 
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a strong alternative with John ($12,000), so we're not desperate to accept any offer below that. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
