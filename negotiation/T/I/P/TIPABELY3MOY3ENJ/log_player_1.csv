"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. My price is $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is to maximize profit.  $105 is too low, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $105, which means there's room for a compromise.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great deal for you and still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering the price from $115 to $110.
* **Empathy:** I acknowledge his budget constraints to build goodwill.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" for Bob while still highlighting the fair profit for myself.
* **Open to Discussion:** I again end with ""What do you think?"" to keep the negotiation open."
