"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price.  I'm not yet at a point where I feel pressured to accept a lower offer than I'd like, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative with John.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9000 to $8000, so how about $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I think I can get closer to my desired price. I have the option of selling to John, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $8,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle again, but $8750 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $8250, which is a fair price for me. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although $8,250 is getting closer to my minimum desired price, I still believe I can get a better offer. I'm not desperate and have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can push him to a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8200, which is a fair price for me. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,200 is getting close to my minimum desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not desperate and have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can push him to a higher price. There are still a couple rounds left, so I'm not under a lot of pressure yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,200 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $8,350. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. Let's call it a day and move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 8350} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8350, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is my maximum budget. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is the last round, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, it's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk getting nothing or a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
