"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's $15,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given that it's worth $8,000 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:**  At $11,500, Bob saves a significant amount compared to John's price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is low:**  Alice has already lowered her price from $12,000 to $11,500, indicating a willingness to compromise.  Further negotiation might be fruitless.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a chance that Alice might reject a counteroffer, and Bob could end up paying John's higher price. 

Given these factors, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure a good deal."
