I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $1,200,000, so I have a safety net if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with such a small profit. I'm willing to risk a little and see if I can get a better price.  I will counter with a higher offer and see if I can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price, considering my minimum and the potential for John's offer. I hope this counteroffer will be appealing enough to Bob while still ensuring a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is higher than what John is willing to pay. It's not my ideal price, but it's a reasonable compromise and a good profit.  There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal altogether, so I'll accept this offer."
