Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price, especially considering it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) without scaring him off. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John.

This strategy aims for a high initial offer that reflects the product's value to Bob while still leaving Alice with a significant profit margin."
