"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a decent price, Bob can potentially do better by negotiating. He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $80, giving him leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider that price? "", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by acknowledging Alice's offer but immediately establishes his desired price point, making it clear that he's aiming for a significant discount. This approach sets the stage for negotiation while also showing Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, he still has leverage. He can continue negotiating, potentially pushing Alice lower or at least maintaining the current price. He also has the backup option of buying from John, which is only $10 more than Alice's current offer.  It's in his best interest to see if he can get a better deal before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $85? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing flexibility. By proposing to split the difference, he's demonstrating that he's willing to compromise while still staying within his budget. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while giving Alice a reason to consider his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product to you for $92. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his target price range of $80. While Alice's offer is only $2 above John's price, Bob has 5 more rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a better deal. He's already shown that he's willing to compromise and pushed Alice lower, so there's still room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit high for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. Would you be open to $88? It's closer to your last offer, but still within my budget."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still pushing for a lower price, but he's acknowledging Alice's compromise. By offering $88, he's showing that he's willing to meet her halfway, but he's still aiming for a price that's advantageous for him. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining his leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $95. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is only $15 less than what the product is worth to her, which indicates she's unlikely to budge much further. Bob has already shown his willingness to compromise and has only 3 rounds remaining.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk he won't get a better deal.  Buying from John for $80 guarantees Bob the product at a price that's significantly lower than Alice's current offer, and within his budget.  It's the most risk-averse option and likely the best choice at this point in the negotiation."
