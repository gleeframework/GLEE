"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider that price? ",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $85? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product to you for $92. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit high for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. Would you be open to $88? It's closer to your last offer, but still within my budget.",88.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $95. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and it's still a good deal for you.",95.0,Alice,7,
