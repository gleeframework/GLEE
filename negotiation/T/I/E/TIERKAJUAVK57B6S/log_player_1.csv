Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's still below your minimum value. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $115 is closer but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you do $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $110 is still slightly below my preferred price, it's very close and  Bob seems unlikely to budge further. It's best to accept this offer rather than risk a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a sale to John for $100."
