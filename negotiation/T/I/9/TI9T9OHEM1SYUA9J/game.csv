"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than your offer.
