Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a more favorable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can meet you halfway between $1,275,000 and $1,300,000, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,287,500. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, saving him $87,500.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might result in a slightly better price, but the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
