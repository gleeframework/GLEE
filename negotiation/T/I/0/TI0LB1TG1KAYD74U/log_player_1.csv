Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it also leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how willing he is to pay for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing some flexibility. It's also above my minimum acceptable price, leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial goal, I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with nothing.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
