Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 (what Bob is willing to pay) and $1,499,999 (the highest you'd offer before taking John's deal).

**Strategy**

You want to start high but leave room to negotiate down to Bob's valuation without going below your minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting closer to your guaranteed price, showing you value the product highly.
* **Room to Negotiate:** The $1,450,000 leaves a good buffer for negotiation. Bob is likely to counter, and you can strategically reduce the price while gauging his seriousness. 
* **Professionalism:** The message is polite and emphasizes value, encouraging a positive negotiation.

**Important Note:** How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to negotiate, but stand firm on not going below your $1,500,000 minimum."
