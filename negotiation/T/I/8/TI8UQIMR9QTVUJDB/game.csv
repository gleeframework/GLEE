"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's something truly special that I believe will be a great asset to your business.  My initial price for it is $1000000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $800000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point. However, I'm willing to come down a bit more to $900000. This still leaves us both room for a profitable deal. Let's see if we can close this gap.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue discussing this.  $850000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still holding out for $880000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to come away satisfied.  What do you say?",880000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $880000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $870000, but no higher. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",870000.0,Bob,6,
