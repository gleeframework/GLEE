"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $140. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. Can you consider it?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a good price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I'm still willing to work with you. $115 is closer but I can't go lower than $120. This is a fair price given the value of the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
