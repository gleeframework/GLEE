"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. Given my budget, I'm prepared to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer already reflects a significant discount on the true value of this product.  I could be persuaded to come down to $1,025,000, but that's my absolute best offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be realistic about this.  The value of this product is substantial, and $900,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000, but that's my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $975,000.  I'm really pushing the limits of my budget, but I'm willing to go to $950,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap and reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
