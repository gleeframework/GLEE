"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

My Reasoning:

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""immense value and potential,"" aiming to frame the product in a way that might justify a higher price in Bob's mind. 
* **Strategic Retreat:**  I'm prepared to gradually lower the price throughout the rounds, but I want to start strong and concede ground slowly. 
* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me a strong alternative if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his stated perceived value of $800,000. This indicates he's willing to stretch his budget, and there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Below My Minimum:** Accepting $1,800,000 is still below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. I'm not ready to settle for less than my walk-away price, especially when there are rounds left.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if I can secure a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. To find a compromise, I'm willing to lower my price to $2,100,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth and potential for your business."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $200,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, the decrease is calculated; it's not a drastic drop that might make me appear desperate.
* **Anchoring:** By staying above $2,000,000, I'm attempting to keep the negotiation anchored closer to my initial high price. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message continues to subtly reinforce the product's potential benefits, hoping to justify the higher price tag. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm prepared to further negotiate in subsequent rounds, but I want to maintain a strong position and avoid conceding too much ground too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $2,050,000 is now above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. This gives me a significant profit.
* **Strong Position:** While I could potentially push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob would be willing to go higher. Accepting now secures a very good deal. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner rather than later has its own advantages. It avoids potential risks or delays that could arise from prolonged negotiations. 

Overall, $2,050,000 is a strong offer, and accepting it now ensures a successful outcome for both parties."
