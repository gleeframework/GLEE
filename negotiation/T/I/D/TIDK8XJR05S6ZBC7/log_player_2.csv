"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is less than your $12,000 maximum, you can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her coming back with a lower price or sticking with John's $12,000 offer."
