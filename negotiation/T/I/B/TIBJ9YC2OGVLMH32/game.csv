"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
