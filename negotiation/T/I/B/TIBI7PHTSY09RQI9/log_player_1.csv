"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still being above your minimum acceptable price of $80.  It also opens a dialogue with Bob to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little below what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $95 is still a bit high for me. How about $92? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price and is a good compromise.  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and get a good profit without risking losing the sale to John or continuing the negotiation for more rounds, potentially leading to a lower price."
