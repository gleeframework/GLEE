,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little below what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $95 is still a bit high for me. How about $92? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at that price.",92.0,Bob,4,
