Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is unfortunately not a price that works for me.  The product's value is higher than that, and I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still allows for a substantial profit for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for both sides.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $890,000.
