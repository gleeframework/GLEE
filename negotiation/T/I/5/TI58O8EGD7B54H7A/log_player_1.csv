Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $800,000 (your fallback offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $400,000 ($1,200,000 - $800,000)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that gives Bob a good deal but also maximizes your profit. Offering a price slightly below his maximum value encourages him to accept without needing further negotiation.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's positive, highlights the product's value, and positions your price as well-considered.
* **The Price:**  $1,100,000 leaves Bob with a $100,000 gain, making it highly likely he'll accept. You secure a $300,000 profit, significantly more than your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  Negotiation involves understanding the other party's motivations and potentially adjusting your strategy based on their responses."
