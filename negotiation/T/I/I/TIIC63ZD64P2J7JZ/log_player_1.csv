Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob might be willing to pay more since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it is still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
``` 

I'm offering Bob a price of $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from his offer and still allowing me to make a profit above my minimum acceptable price. This should incentivize him to accept the offer while still staying within a reasonable range for me."
