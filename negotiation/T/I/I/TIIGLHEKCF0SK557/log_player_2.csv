"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can save money by negotiating with Alice, even if it takes a few rounds.  $120 is still too high for your desired price range."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. $120 is a bit steep for me, though. How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $115? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You can still try to get a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $100, so there's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $115 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $110. That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $112? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you've gotten the price down to $112, which is within your budget and closer to your target price.  It's unlikely you'll be able to get a significantly lower price from Alice, and you'd be risking going back and forth for longer.  It's a good deal compared to John, who's offering the product for $150."
