,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. $120 is a bit steep for me, though. How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $115? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $115 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $110. That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $112? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
