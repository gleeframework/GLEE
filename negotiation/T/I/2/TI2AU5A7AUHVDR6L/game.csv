"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's a good start, but I'm looking to pay closer to $600,000. I believe there's room to find a price that works for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer was $800,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000.  I think this is a fair compromise given our previous offers. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Alice,7,
