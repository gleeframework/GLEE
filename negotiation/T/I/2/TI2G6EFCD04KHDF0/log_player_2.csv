"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it presents significant value for this price, considering its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:**  $13,250 is significantly lower than the initial $14,000 and closer to Bob's counteroffer of $12,500.
* **The risk of further negotiation:** There's a chance Alice might reject another counteroffer from Bob, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Minimizing risk and saving money:** Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price lower than John's, and it's a good middle ground with Alice."
