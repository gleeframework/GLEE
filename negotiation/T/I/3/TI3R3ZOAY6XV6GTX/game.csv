"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
