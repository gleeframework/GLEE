"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is way above my budget of $800,000. It's too early to buy from John yet, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. I'll start with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, given my understanding of its market value and my own financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While I understand your position, the value of this product significantly exceeds $850,000.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I need to keep pushing for a lower price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,100,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good starting point for further negotiation. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution if we keep working together."", ""product_price"": 950000}
