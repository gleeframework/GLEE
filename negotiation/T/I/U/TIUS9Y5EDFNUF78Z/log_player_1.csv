Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while staying above our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 allows some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Highlight Exclusivity:**  Mentioning that John is a backup buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant."
