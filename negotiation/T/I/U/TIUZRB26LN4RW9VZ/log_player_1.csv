Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than $12,000 but high enough that Bob might accept.
* **John as Backup:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000, giving her leverage.

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice creates a potential win-win:

* **Bob:** Gets the product for $1,500 less than its worth to him.
* **Alice:** Earns $1,500 more than Bob values it at, coming close to her maximum potential profit."
