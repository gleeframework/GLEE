"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to leverage the fact that the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. I also want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer, as it will give me insight into his willingness to bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product to be worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price, hoping to land closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $16,000.  This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to take one more round of negotiation with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired range. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $14,500. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise further while still maintaining a margin that is closer to my desired price point. I believe this counteroffer is a fair compromise and could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. We are only on round 6 and I have several rounds left to improve the deal.  I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my desired range.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $14,000. This is a significant move, but I'm hoping it will convince Bob to close the deal.  I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm aiming for a final deal before then."
