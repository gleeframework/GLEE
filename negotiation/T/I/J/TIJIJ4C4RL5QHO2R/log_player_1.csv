Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've received, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Maintain Credibility:** While the price is above Bob's value, it's not so outrageous as to be insulting. It positions the product as highly desirable.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John provides leverage. If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose out.

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit. If the goal was to ensure a sale to Bob specifically, a different approach focusing on a price closer to his perceived value would be more appropriate."
