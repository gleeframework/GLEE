"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,000. That's a fair price for both of us, as it's still much higher than what the product is worth to me. Let's try to reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers a unique set of benefits, and I'm confident it can generate much more value for you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $16,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a good compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $15,000 for this to make sense for me. Let's split the difference again - would you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, but that's my absolute final offer. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Take it or leave it.",12000.0,Alice,7,
