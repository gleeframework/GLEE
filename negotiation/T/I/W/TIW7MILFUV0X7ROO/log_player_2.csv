You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let me know if that works for you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to negotiating further, but $97 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $101.  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $100.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price."
