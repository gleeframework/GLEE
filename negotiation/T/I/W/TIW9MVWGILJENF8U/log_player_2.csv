Round 2

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $130.  Let me know if that works for you.
