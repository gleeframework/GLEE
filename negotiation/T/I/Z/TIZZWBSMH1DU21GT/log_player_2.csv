"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I think the product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $115 is less than your maximum of $150. 
* **You've made progress:** You started at $120 and got it down to $115, a reasonable compromise. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee you'll get a lower price if you reject again. Alice might be firm on $115, and you could end up paying more or buying from John at $150."
