"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal.  You can start by making a counteroffer closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price ($800,000) to see if you can strike a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts by offering a price slightly higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($800,000). It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further. If she rejects this, you can then increase the offer incrementally to hopefully find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $900,000, which is within my budget and a significant improvement from her previous offer. While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and the possibility of having to buy from John at a much higher price makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
