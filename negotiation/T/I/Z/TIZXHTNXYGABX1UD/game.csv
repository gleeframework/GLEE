"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product is worth considerably less to me than your initial asking price. I'd be willing to offer $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. Let's find a more agreeable middle ground. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does my time.  I could buy this from John right now. To make it worth my while, I'd need to see a significant price reduction.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right that time is valuable, and I respect your position.  While I'm confident this product is worth significantly more than your offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I need to consider other buyers if we can't find an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
