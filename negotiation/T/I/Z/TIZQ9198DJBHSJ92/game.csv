"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. Is this something you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  How about we split the difference?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting the feeling we might be stuck here. I'm really interested in this product but I'm firm on my offer of $90.  If you can't meet me there, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession - I'll meet you at $95. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,7,
