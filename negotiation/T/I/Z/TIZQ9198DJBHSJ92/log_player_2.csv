"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $150 is way above your budget of $80.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $80.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred price point of $80.  There's room for further negotiation, and you have more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to your preferred price, it's still a little high.  You've already made it clear that you're willing to spend up to $90, and there's no reason to budge further until Alice does."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting the feeling we might be stuck here. I'm really interested in this product but I'm firm on my offer of $90.  If you can't meet me there, I'm going to have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession - I'll meet you at $95. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is still above your ideal price of $80, it's very close.  You've already shown your willingness to negotiate and made it clear that you're interested in the product.  Accepting Alice's offer at $95 is a good compromise that secures the product for you without exceeding your budget significantly.  You also have fewer rounds remaining, making it more likely that you'll be unable to negotiate a lower price."
