"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair reflection of its value to me at this time.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I feel like we're getting closer.  I can tell this product is important to you, and I respect that.  To be honest, $825,000 is pushing my budget, but I'm willing to stretch to $775,000 if that works for you.",775000.0,Bob,6,
