"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd like to offer you $1050000 for it. This aligns with the value I'm placing on the product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting,  it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
