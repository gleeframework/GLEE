"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest! While $8,500 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your initial asking price, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counteroffer $8,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $8,000.",8750.0,Bob,4,
