,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $80 for it to be worth my while. How about $85? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $85 is slightly above my budget. I would like to propose $80 as the price for your product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",80.0,Bob,4,
