"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the product's value.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you need a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a substantial amount and shows how serious I am about this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $900,000 is closer but still a bit too low. Let's try $1,000,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be perfectly honest, $800,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
