Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think the product is a good one, but I was hoping to get a better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80). Accepting this offer maximizes my profit in this round.
