Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a significant amount, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still trying to get a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get even closer to $1 million, Bob's offer of $960,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than John's offer, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation."
