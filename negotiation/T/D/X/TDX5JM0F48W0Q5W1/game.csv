"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product offers.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,400,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer reflects a more accurate assessment of the product's worth.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
