Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is better than John's, but still significantly below its value to me.  I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,400,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer reflects a more accurate assessment of the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant profit. It's a good balance between maximizing my earnings and the risk of continuing negotiations."
