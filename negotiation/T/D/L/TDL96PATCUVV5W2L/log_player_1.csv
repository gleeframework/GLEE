Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm willing to sell for at least $8,000, so I want to start with a price significantly higher than that.
* **Bob's value:** I know Bob values the product at $15,000. I'm aiming for a price that's a good compromise, giving Bob a decent deal while also ensuring I make a substantial profit.
* **Negotiation potential:** Offering $12,000 leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a higher price if Bob is willing to counteroffer.
* **John's offer:**  Having John as an alternative buyer provides a safety net, ensuring I won't be forced to accept a price significantly lower than my minimum if Bob rejects my initial offer."
