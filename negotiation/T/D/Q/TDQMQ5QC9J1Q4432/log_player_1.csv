"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $180, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired selling price.
* **Positive and Engaging Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and engaging to encourage Bob to consider the offer. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to pique his interest. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects this offer, I can adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not going to settle for the lowest possible price right away.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Show I'm not desperate:** This conveys that I value the product and am not willing to give it away cheaply.
* **Explore if Bob has more to offer:**  Perhaps he's willing to go higher than $120, and rejecting his offer gives me an opportunity to find out.

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you taking the time to consider my product. I'm happy to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $120 is just a bit too low for me.  I'd be willing to let it go for $150, as a compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering the price from $180 to $150, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's value, hoping to get Bob to see its worth and potentially increase his offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and friendly tone helps keep the negotiation productive.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that benefits both of us while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and at $130, the deal is now within a range that's acceptable to me.  I'm willing to accept this offer for the following reasons:

* **Profit:** $130 is above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm making a profit.
* **Time:** We are nearing the middle of the negotiation, and it's not guaranteed that Bob will continue to raise his offer. Accepting now ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further rounds.
* **Opportunity Cost:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing him as a buyer and having to sell to John for a lower price. 

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good price for the product and move on to other opportunities."
