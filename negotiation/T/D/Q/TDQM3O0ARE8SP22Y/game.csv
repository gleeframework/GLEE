"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? It's a fair price and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? This would ensure we both get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
