"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Since your maximum budget is $12,000, and John is offering the product at that price, there's no reason to negotiate further with Alice. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price."
