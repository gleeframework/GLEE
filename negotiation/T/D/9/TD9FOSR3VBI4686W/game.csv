"I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $14000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
