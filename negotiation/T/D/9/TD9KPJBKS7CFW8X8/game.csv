"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $7,000.  That's a fair offer considering John is willing to sell it for $8,000.",7000.0,Bob,4,
