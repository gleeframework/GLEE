"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the value I place on this product is quite significant. How about we settle on $2,000,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,700,000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
