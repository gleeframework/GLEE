"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $800,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're unable to meet that, I understand, but I'm hoping we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $825,000, which is only $25,000 more than your final offer. I believe this is a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,7,
