"I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $1200000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that is worth $1500000 to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1000000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is only worth $1000000 to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price that still benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1125000? This would be a significant savings for me while still providing you with a healthy profit margin.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1125000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $1150000. This is a reasonable price that still allows me to make a profit, while also being closer to your target price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
