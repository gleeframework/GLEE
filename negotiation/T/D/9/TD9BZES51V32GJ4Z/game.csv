"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $8000.  Let's start at $9000 and see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price is $8000, but I'm still looking to get a better deal for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our prices. How about we try $10000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle again, at $9000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $10250. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $9000.  To make a final push, I'm willing to offer $9500. This would be a good deal for both of us, and would avoid us having to go through further negotiations.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,6,
