"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget of $100. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's still below Alice's minimum, leaving room for potential compromise in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is a compromise, it's still above your desired price point. You have several rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to pay $140, which is closer to my budget and a fairer compromise. "", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is again a significant reduction from Alice's previous offer, showing your commitment to finding a price you're comfortable with. This offer is still above your absolute maximum of $100, but leaves room for Alice to accept or make a further counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to compromise at $155, which is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $155 is still outside your budget. You still have several rounds left, and it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm getting closer to where I want to be, but $155 is still a stretch. I'm confident we can both be happy with $145. This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a small decrease from Alice's last offer, showing continued negotiation but also acknowledging the potential for a deal to be made. It's closer to your preferred price point and is still above Alice's minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $150, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering a lower price than before, $150 is still above your budget. You have only a few rounds left, and it's likely you won't be able to negotiate further. Since John is offering the product for your target price of $100, it's the most sensible option to buy from him and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
