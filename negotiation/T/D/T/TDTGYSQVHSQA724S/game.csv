"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160.",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to pay $140, which is closer to my budget and a fairer compromise. ",140.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,155.0
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to compromise at $155, which is a fair price considering the product's value.",155.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I'm getting closer to where I want to be, but $155 is still a stretch. I'm confident we can both be happy with $145. This would be a good compromise for both of us.",145.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,150.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $150, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",150.0,Alice,7,,
