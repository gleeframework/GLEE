"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $850,000? I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  However, to be completely transparent, $850,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to come down slightly to $880,000, but that's my final offer.",880000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $880,000. Would you be willing to consider $860,000? I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been very transparent about my price expectations, and I need to see some movement from your side to continue this negotiation.  My final offer is $870,000.  If you can't meet that, I need to explore other options.",870000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, but I'm still not comfortable with $870,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll counter with $830,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",830000.0,Bob,8,
