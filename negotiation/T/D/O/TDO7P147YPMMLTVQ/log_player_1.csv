"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,500, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the value of the product to Bob without directly mentioning his perceived value of $12,000.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged. This starting point allows for potential counteroffers and helps me gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my need to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product and would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:** Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, leaving me no profit. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I have 8 rounds left and know Bob values the product at $12,000.  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation.
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer right away means I make no profit.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the upper hand in the negotiation. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer and see if I can push Bob towards a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $10,750. This gives you a good deal and allows me to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a slight concession by coming down from my initial $11,500 offer, but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise that benefits both of us, emphasizing the ""good deal"" for Bob.
* **Finality:** This is a reasonable counteroffer, and I'm setting the stage for either Bob accepting or continuing negotiations. 

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to establish a middle ground, aiming for a quick deal while still staying above my minimum. If Bob accepts, I've secured a profit. If not, I'll be ready to negotiate further, adjusting my offers based on his responses."
