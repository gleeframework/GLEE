"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. It's a fair compromise considering its worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm hoping to find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12,800. It's a bit above your latest offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
