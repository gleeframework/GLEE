Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, which means getting as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. Since you have a backup offer, you can afford to be a little bolder.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still being attractive to Bob, saving him $100,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even without explicitly mentioning John) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  Bob may counter-offer.  Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Relationship Matters:** Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If a deal close to your asking price jeopardizes future interactions, it might be worth a small concession."
