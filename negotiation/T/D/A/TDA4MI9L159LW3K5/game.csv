"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price given the product's value and potential. What are your thoughts on that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the $900,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,050,000? I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
