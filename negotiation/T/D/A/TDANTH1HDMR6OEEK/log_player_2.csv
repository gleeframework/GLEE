"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, you can potentially get it for even less.  Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to negotiate further.  A counteroffer might lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $10,000, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still demonstrating my seriousness in wanting to buy the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point. Accepting the offer at $9,500 saves me $2,500 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling apart in the remaining rounds isn't worth the potential extra savings."
