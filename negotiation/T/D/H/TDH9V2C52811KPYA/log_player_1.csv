"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a strong starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate down from there. I want to see if he values the product higher than my minimum, and if not, we can start working towards a price that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me and shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this encourages Bob to come up slightly from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,000.  This is a good price, and I'm happy to close the deal. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's important to be realistic and secure a sale."
