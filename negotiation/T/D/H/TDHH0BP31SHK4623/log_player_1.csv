Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and frames the price as ""fair,"" increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message also leaves the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion, making it less likely he'll immediately reject the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and ensuring Bob is still motivated to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Maximization:** Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly higher than my minimum value of $80 and closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to further price reductions, potentially ending up with a lower price than $90.  
* **Time and Effort:** Selling to John for $80 is guaranteed, but it's less profitable. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and secure a good profit.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision, considering the potential for further negotiation and the time and effort involved in finding another buyer."
