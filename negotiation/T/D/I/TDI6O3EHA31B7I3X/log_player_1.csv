{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My starting price is $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point if I keep negotiating with Bob.  I'll try to make a counteroffer that's still attractive to him, but brings me closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated.  Let's compromise at $875,000. This still provides you with a significant profit and allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to be fairly compensated, Alice, but I still think $800,000 is a reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $825,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although he has moved up to $825,000, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I believe we can continue negotiating and find a price point that works for both of us. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'll offer $825,000 again, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is sticking to his $825,000 price. We've reached a stalemate, and it's becoming increasingly unlikely that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds.  I'm not comfortable risking further time and potentially losing out on the deal altogether. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $800,000."
