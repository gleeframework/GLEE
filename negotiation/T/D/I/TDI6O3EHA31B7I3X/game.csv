"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My starting price is $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated.  Let's compromise at $875,000. This still provides you with a significant profit and allows me to cover my costs.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to be fairly compensated, Alice, but I still think $800,000 is a reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $825,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'll offer $825,000 again, and I hope you'll consider it.",825000.0,Bob,6,
