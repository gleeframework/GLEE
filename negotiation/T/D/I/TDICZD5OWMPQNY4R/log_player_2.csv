"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can push the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is still a decent price for Alice, and only $5 below her initial offer. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and I'm hoping she'll accept to avoid further haggling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point.  While I would prefer a lower price, accepting this offer is the most sensible option.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to buy the product."
