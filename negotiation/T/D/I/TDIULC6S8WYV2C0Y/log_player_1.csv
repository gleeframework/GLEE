Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value it brings, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, I still can't exceed $8,000. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to sell for $8,000, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $8,000 is just not going to cut it. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finalize the sale.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
