You can do better than $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $95. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

$95 is a good price for you, as it's within your budget and a better deal than buying from John."
