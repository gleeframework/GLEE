Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $15,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product is worth more than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) by using phrases like ""true value"" and ""highly beneficial"".

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiating style or financial limits.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, you always have John as a backup."
