"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is aggressive, leaving a significant margin for Bob while still securing a substantial profit for you. It also sets a clear expectation for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below your desired minimum.  You have 8 rounds remaining to negotiate with Bob, and there's a good chance you can secure a better price. Selling to John now would mean leaving a substantial amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to your desired minimum of $1,000,000 and still leaves you with a decent profit.  You have 6 rounds remaining, but there's no guarantee that you'll be able to negotiate a better price. Accepting his offer ensures a solid outcome and avoids the risk of ending up with the lower offer from John."
