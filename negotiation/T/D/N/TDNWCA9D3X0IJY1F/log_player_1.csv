Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $15,000.**  I have a guaranteed sale to John at that price, so anything lower is a loss for me.
* **Bob's value is $8,000.** I need to offer him a price that is higher than that to incentivize him to buy.
* **I'm willing to compromise slightly.**  By offering $14,000, I'm leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still potentially securing a sale with Bob."
