"I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be honest, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still quite attached to this product and would like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9500? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this product.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $9500. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $9500 is too high for you? Can we try $9000?",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $9000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about we try $9500 one more time? That's the lowest I can go.",9500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $10000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,9,
