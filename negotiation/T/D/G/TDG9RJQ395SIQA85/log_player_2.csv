"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still above her minimum selling price. This should encourage her to negotiate further."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
