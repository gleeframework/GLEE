Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll try to get a better price from him."
