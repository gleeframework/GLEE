"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than what Bob values the product at. This gives me room to negotiate down and still make a profit.
* **Appealing Message:** I've added a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel like I'm offering him a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's enough space between my starting price and Bob's valuation for a back-and-forth, allowing for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has come down in price, $110 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a safe bet:** While selling to John for $150 is an attractive option, I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. I understand that $110 is your price point, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Let's meet in the middle at $120.  This gives us both a fair deal and allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial offer but still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Positive Messaging:** I'm using encouraging language to keep Bob engaged and  show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Fair Deal:**  I'm framing $120 as a fair deal for both of us, making it more likely Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for improvement:**  While I'm closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a safe bet:** I'm still confident I can get a higher price from Bob, but selling to John is a good alternative if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm happy to meet you halfway at $118. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. "", ""product_price"": 118}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm only going down a small amount from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a good price for me.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language (""happy to meet you halfway"") and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Closing the Gap:** $118 is closer to Bob's desired price, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're already at round 6, meaning only 4 rounds remain.  
* **Negotiation stalled:**  Bob's offer of $112 is still below my minimum price, and it's unlikely we'll close the gap in the remaining rounds.
* **Secure a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation failures. 

It's better to secure a known good outcome than risk losing more time trying to get a slightly better price from Bob."
