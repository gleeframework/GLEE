"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
