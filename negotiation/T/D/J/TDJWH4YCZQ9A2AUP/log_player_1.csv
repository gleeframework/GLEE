{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is still significantly below the product's value. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $1,075,000 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a bit more. We've already established that the product is worth a lot more to Bob, and there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get him to go higher."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  We're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for $1,070,000 just yet. I'm hoping to push for a bit more in the next round, but I'm also mindful that I only have a few rounds left and need to be strategic. If we don't reach an agreement soon, selling to John might be the best option."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, we're running out of time, and Bob's offer is getting too low. I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
