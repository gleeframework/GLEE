Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's successfully negotiated the price down to $10,500, which is within his budget and a good deal for him.  While he could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away or he'll end up having to buy from John for a significantly higher price."
