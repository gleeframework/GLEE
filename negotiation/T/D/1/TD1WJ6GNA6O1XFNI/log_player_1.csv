"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message upbeat and friendly, creating a more collaborative atmosphere. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, making it more attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I am willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I would get from John.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I have 8 rounds left, and there's a chance he'll come up to a more acceptable price.
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000.  This price still reflects the significant value you'll receive from this product. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not rejecting Bob outright but offering a counteroffer that is still above my minimum and closer to his offer.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm still highlighting the product's value to Bob to justify the price. 
* **Positive and collaborative tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging a win-win situation.
* **Remaining flexible:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation while not dropping below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still looking to keep the cost below $1,500,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,450,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his offer is still below the $1,500,000 I would get from John.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 6 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob.  There's no guarantee he'll come up to my desired price.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation. 

**Conclusion:**  With limited rounds remaining and a guaranteed alternative, it's strategically better to sell to John for $1,500,000."
