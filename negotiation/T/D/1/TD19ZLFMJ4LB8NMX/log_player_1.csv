"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I believe we can reach a fair compromise. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $11,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acquiring the product I need. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
