"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the product's value to Bob ($900,000 vs. $1,200,000).  Bob can likely negotiate a better price, so it makes sense to reject the offer and counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, recognizing its value. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $1,050,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll counter with an offer of $975,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still not ideal.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially secure a better deal by continuing the back-and-forth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This offer is fair and reflects the value we've discussed. Let's aim for a final agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'll counter with an offer of $998,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $998,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $998,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close:**  Alice's offer of $998,000 is very close to Bob's target price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, there's a risk that continuing negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Alice backing out entirely.
* **Jhon's offer:** While Bob could buy from Jhon, it's a higher price than Alice's current offer.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price, and it's less risky than potentially losing the deal or having to pay more to Jhon."
