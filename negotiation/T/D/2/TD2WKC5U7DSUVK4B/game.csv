"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I can meet you in the middle, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9800, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other interested buyers, so I'd like to make a deal with you soon.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I still think I can get a bit more. I'm willing to meet you at $9700, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I may need to consider other options.",9700.0,Alice,7,

"I've given you a lot of flexibility, Bob, and I'm starting to think you're not serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9700 one last time, but if I don't get a serious offer, I'll be forced to explore other options. This is my final counteroffer.",9700.0,Alice,9,
