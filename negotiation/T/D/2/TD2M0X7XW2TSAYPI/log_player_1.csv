Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, giving me room to negotiate if necessary. 
* I'm aiming for a higher price because I know I have a backup buyer in John, who is willing to pay $10,000. 
* This allows me to test the waters with Bob and see if he values the product higher. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll go with John's offer, ensuring I still make a good profit."
