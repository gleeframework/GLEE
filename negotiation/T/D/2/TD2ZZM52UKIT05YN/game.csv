"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth a lot to your business. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I see the value in the product, but I could only justify going as high as $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,050,000? This would allow you to acquire the product at a price significantly below its true value, while still allowing me to get a fair return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but we're still a ways off. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This seems like a fair compromise to me. What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer, but $975,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me a little bit more on this.  Would you consider $1,000,000 even? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you are.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
