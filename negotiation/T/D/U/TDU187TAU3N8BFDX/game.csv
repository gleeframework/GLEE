"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me though. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I can do $14,000, which is still a great price considering the value this product offers. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is closer, but still above my budget. Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still negotiating. I can see you're really interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I can do $13,500, which is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
