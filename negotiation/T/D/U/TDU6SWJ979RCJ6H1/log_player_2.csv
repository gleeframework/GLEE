"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. There are 9 more rounds, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts with a strong initial price, significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above Alice's minimum price. This puts the pressure on Alice to negotiate, but leaves room for further adjustments if needed.  The message is friendly and confident, aiming to build a good rapport while making it clear that this is a serious offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's below the market value and allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my target price, it's still above my personal value of $8,000 for the product. With 7 rounds left, it's still worth negotiating further to see if I can secure a price that aligns better with my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $8,750, which is a fair compromise.  This price gives you a good profit while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price but avoids being overly aggressive. It's a smaller jump than the previous counteroffer, suggesting a willingness to reach a compromise. The message emphasizes the fairness of the proposed price and emphasizes a desire to close the deal quickly."
