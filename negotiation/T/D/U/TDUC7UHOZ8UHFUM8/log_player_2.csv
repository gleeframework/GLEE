Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1250000 is still a little below my bottom line.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1275000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget. While the negotiation is progressing, it seems unlikely you'll reach a price below your limit. Considering you have only a few rounds left, it's better to secure the product from John at a fixed price of $1,000,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further risk of a failed negotiation."
