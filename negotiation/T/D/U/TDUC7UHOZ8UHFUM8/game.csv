"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1400000.  This still allows me to recoup a reasonable amount for the product while offering you a significant discount.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is a significant amount for me.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position, but $1200000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial price, and I'm confident it offers you a fair value for the product.  Let's work towards an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $1300000. However, I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's try to finalize this.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
