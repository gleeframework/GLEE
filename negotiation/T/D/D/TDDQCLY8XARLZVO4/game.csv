"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable paying $13,000. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $12,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's reach a deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from your original offer, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $12,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
