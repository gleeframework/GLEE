"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,450,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is truly above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle at $1,325,000. This reflects a fair compromise, don't you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.
