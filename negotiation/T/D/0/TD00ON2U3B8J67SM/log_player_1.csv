"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,450,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

I'm still going to try and negotiate a bit higher.  While Bob is coming up, we're not at a point where taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John makes sense."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,290,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.  What do you think?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'll counter with $1,245,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,245,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,245,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{

}
```

Bob has consistently moved upwards in his offers, and we're now above our minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome, and there's always a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting the $1,245,000 secures a good profit."
