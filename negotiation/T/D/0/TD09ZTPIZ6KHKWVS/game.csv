"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However,  $22,000 is closer to the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $20,000. This is my final offer.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $20,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $19,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me.",19000.0,Bob,4,
