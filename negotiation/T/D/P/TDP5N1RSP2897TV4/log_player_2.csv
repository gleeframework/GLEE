Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Saving Money:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Better Deal:** Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, she's still willing to sell it for a price that's more favorable to Bob than John's offer."
