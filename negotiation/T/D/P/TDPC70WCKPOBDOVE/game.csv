"I'm interested in your product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a little more than that to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a good price for both of us, and we can get this deal done.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again and settle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to move forward with the transaction quickly.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
