(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $10,000, which is your maximum price.  However, you know you can get the product from John for the same price.  There's no advantage to buying from Alice, so you should reject her offer."
