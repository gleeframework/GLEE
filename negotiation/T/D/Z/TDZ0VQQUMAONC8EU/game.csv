"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is something we can agree on.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This still gives you a substantial value for the product, and it allows me to recover a good portion of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. It's slightly higher than my previous offer, but still within my budget constraints. I hope this is acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
