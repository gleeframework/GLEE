"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  I want to see if I can get a little more than the product's worth to me, but I also want to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than my minimum, it's still below what I want to get. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $8,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. I'm hoping he sees this as a fair price, considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, and I'm happy to accept it.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John and it allows me to close the deal without further negotiation."
