Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept.  Here's why:

* **My Perspective:** I'm aiming for a price close to the $10,000 value Bob places on the product. A $9,500 offer still gives me a significant profit ($1,500) while being competitive.
* **Bob's Perspective:**  This price is lower than the $10,000 he values it at, making it a worthwhile deal for him.  He'll likely accept, securing a good deal for himself while still getting the product he wants.

**Important Note:** While this strategy has a good chance of success, there's always a risk.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $8,000. However, aiming for a higher price increases the chance of maximizing my earnings."
