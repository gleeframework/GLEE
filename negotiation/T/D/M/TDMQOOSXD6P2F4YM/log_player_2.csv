"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $85.  It's worth at least $80 to me, so it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I will reject the offer. The product is worth $80 to Alice, so she has some wiggle room to lower the price. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.
