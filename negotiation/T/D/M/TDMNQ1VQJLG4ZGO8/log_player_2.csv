"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $18000. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's too early to buy from John, as I might be able to get a better deal with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter-offer and hopefully get a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $14000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better offer than $18,000, it's still above my budget. It's still early in the negotiation, so I want to see if I can push Alice lower.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter-offer again and potentially get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $11,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
