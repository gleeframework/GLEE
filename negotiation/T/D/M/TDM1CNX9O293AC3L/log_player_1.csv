"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a high starting point, but it allows room for negotiation and leaves some potential for a higher final price. I'm not sure what Bob's maximum willingness to pay is, so it's better to start high and be prepared to go down. If he rejects this offer, we'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price,  $9,200 is a good deal and getting closer to my goal. We've only had four rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can make a good profit with this sale."
