Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects this offer, it will give me a good idea of his perceived value and I can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,400,000 is still a decent amount of money, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my initial goal, $1,425,000 is a good price considering the negotiations. Continuing to bargain may risk losing the deal entirely, and I'm happy to secure a sale at this point."
