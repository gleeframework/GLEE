"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay $12,000 maximum for the product. Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is your maximum price.  However, you can get the product from John for the same price. There is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
