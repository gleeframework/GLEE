"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is a bit high. It's better to negotiate and see if we can get a price closer to $8,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I'm on a bit of a budget right now. Would you consider a price closer to $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit above her value. Let's push a little further before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $9,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference again to encourage Alice while still aiming for a price closer to her valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $9,750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to get as much as possible. While her price is getting closer to acceptable, we're still in a good spot to negotiate, especially since we have John's offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sensing we're close to a deal here. I'm willing to offer $9,250.  Let's wrap this up."",
""product_price"": 9250
}
``` 

We're inching closer to her price but conveying a sense of urgency. This might nudge her to accept, especially since it's a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and my previous offer, which is $9,750. I'll offer the product to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

It seems we've reached a stalemate.  Alice is very consistently aiming for that $9,500 mark. While we could try to push further, it's becoming less likely she'll budge significantly. Accepting at $9,500 is a reasonable compromise, saving us $2,500 compared to John's offer."
