Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving us a chance to still secure a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely mentions ""immense value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price without revealing specifics that might hinder negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. How we proceed depends heavily on Bob's response to this initial offer.  We need to be prepared to negotiate strategically."
