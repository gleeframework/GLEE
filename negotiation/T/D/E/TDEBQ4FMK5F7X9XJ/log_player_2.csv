"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is $3,000 less than your maximum budget and $3,000 more than her valuation. This seems like a fair deal. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product while saving money compared to buying from John."
