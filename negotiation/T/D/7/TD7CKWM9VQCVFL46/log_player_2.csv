"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than what John is offering, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy."
