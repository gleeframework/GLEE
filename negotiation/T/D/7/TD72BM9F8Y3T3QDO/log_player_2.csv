{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. A $10,000 offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for her to make a profit. This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation and shows Bob's serious intent to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a lower price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually lowering the price.  $11,000 is a compromise between Alice's latest offer and Bob's previous counteroffer. This shows he's willing to meet halfway, but also maintains pressure to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above his ideal price. Bob is willing to keep negotiating for a better deal, knowing he has the option to buy from John for $15,000 if he needs to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price.  He is offering $12,000, which is a compromise between Alice's last offer and his previous counteroffer. This shows he is flexible and willing to meet halfway, but is still looking for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than Bob's ideal price. Although time is running out, Bob is still within his limit of 10 rounds and believes he can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's still a chance to reach a price that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial round. With only two rounds remaining, Bob needs to be strategic.  He's offering $12,500, which is a compromise between his last offer and Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates Bob's willingness to come closer, but also underscores his desire to get the best deal. This could be the final push to get Alice to accept. If she doesn't, Bob has John as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left and Alice's offer still well above Bob's target price, the risk of continuing negotiations outweighs the potential reward.  It's highly unlikely that Alice will accept a price significantly lower in the final round.  Therefore,  it's wiser for Bob to secure the product from John for $15,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
