Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is still a good deal for Bob considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to him. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob. 
* **Plan B:** I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's too far below my desired range.  Selling to John would be the ideal outcome, but I'll see if I can push Bob a bit further before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my target while still giving you a good deal.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm highlighting that this price is a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason and fairness.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Target Price:**  $1,350,000 is closer to my desired price while still being a potentially acceptable deal for Bob. 

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while trying to secure a better price for myself. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I will consider selling to John, but I'll see if I can push a bit further first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're not willing to go as low as I was hoping, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $1,320,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think we can make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's too far below what I need.  I believe there's still room for a compromise, and I'll see if I can push Bob a bit more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference at $1,335,000? This would be a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1335000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's only slightly higher than Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Fairness and Collaboration:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a ""fair compromise"" and that we're working together to find a solution. This approach aims to maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Moving Closer to Target:** $1,335,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's significantly closer and might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies that I'm open to further discussion and compromise.  

If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John, but I'll give him one more chance to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still not willing to budge much, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go much higher than $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make it work. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and it seems he's reaching his limit.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of going back and forth without reaching an agreement is too high.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the most logical and profitable decision at this point.  It guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further potential loss of time and energy on a negotiation that may not lead to a successful outcome."
