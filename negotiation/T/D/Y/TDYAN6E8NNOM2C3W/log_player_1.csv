"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm offering $130, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a fair price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I have several rounds left and I don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

I'm lowering my price again to $115.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to make a higher counteroffer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Although Bob's offer is getting closer, I've only got a few rounds left and John is guaranteed to give me my minimum price.  It's not worth risking losing more time and money to potentially reach a deal with Bob."
