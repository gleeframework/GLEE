"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,300,000?  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
