"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($150) to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  This allows for some potential bargaining room and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is better than my minimum, I'm not satisfied yet.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is still above my minimum price, but it's lower than my initial offer, showing some flexibility while still aiming for a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $150 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  This could be a good point to reach an agreement, but I'm still willing to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $147. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $147
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. While I'd like to get more from Bob, we're nearing the end of the negotiation and I'm running out of time. John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale completely."
