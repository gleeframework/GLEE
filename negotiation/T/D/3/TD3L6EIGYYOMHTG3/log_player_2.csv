Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm impressed by your persistence and willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I've already had an offer from John for $1,000,000, and I'm starting to consider taking it. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet my minimum price of $1,100,000. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's time to cut bait. Alice is clearly bluffing about John's offer, trying to pressure me.  She's been unwilling to budge below $1,100,000, and I'm not going higher. John's offer, while not ideal, is a guaranteed way to get the product within my budget."
