"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $1,200,000 by you. Our initial offer for this exceptional item is $1,150,000. We believe this price reflects its high quality and value, while also providing you with a significant advantage over the market rate. Let's work together to finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still too high for Bob. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we aim for a price of $1,100,000? This still offers a good profit margin for us while being closer to your desired amount. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I propose a final offer of $1,085,000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between our interests and provides a satisfactory profit margin for us. I hope this aligns with your budget and expectations.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,085,000 is only $5,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer. With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob can negotiate a significantly lower price. Accepting the offer ensures that Bob gets the product at a price that is within his budget and saves him $115,000 compared to buying from John."
