"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,000. This still leaves a bit of room for profit for both of us, and it's closer to the value I placed on the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to do $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  To be fair, I'm willing to meet you at $8,900. This is my final offer, and it's the closest I can come to your price while still making a profit. Let me know if you're interested.",8900.0,Alice,5,
