Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120 before listing it publicly. Interested?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $80, it's always best to start negotiations higher than you expect to settle. This leaves room for compromise and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to negotiate you down.
* **Not Too High:** Offering a price too close to $150 (your minimum) leaves no room for negotiation and might immediately turn Bob away.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning you have other interested buyers (even subtly like ""listing it publicly"") can incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
