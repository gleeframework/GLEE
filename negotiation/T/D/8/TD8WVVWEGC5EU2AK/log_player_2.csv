"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get a better deal than $130 since you're willing to pay up to $150.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 130 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about 135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

Alice's offer of $135 is better than what John is offering ($150) and is closer to your desired price point.  It's a good deal, so accept the offer."
