"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a starting point for our conversation, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:**  Starting at my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) establishes a firm anchor and signals the product's high value to me. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes this is just an opening offer and encourages Bob to share his perspective. This leaves room for negotiation while subtly conveying that I have other options. 
* **Strategic ambiguity:** I don't immediately reveal John's offer. Having a backup plan strengthens my position, but revealing it too early might make Bob less willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you place on it, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is quite good, I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I have enough rounds to spare, and John's guaranteed offer provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is attractive, the value I place on this product is firmly above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects my seriousness about finding a fair agreement."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and firmness:** I acknowledge Bob's offer as attractive but stand firm on my valuation being higher. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Significant counter:** A $50,000 increase from Bob's offer signals a strong desire to close the deal while still leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" I emphasize fairness and encourage Bob to reciprocate with a reasonable counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's perspective and appreciate her willingness to compromise. I am still committed to finding a fair price for both parties. My revised offer is $925,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and negotiating in good faith, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. The difference between his offer ($925,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,000,000) is significant enough to warrant at least one more counteroffer. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a deal closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $925,000 is close, but I need to feel confident I'm getting its true value. Would you be willing to consider $940,000? I believe that's a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions."",
""product_price"": 940000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive reinforcement:** I start by acknowledging Bob's seriousness and validating his efforts. This helps maintain a positive tone despite the continued negotiation.
* **Small concession:** I decrease my counteroffer amount from $950,000 to $940,000, signaling a willingness to move closer to an agreement. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I reiterate the ""fair compromise"" angle to subtly nudge Bob towards a similar mindset. 
* **Sense of urgency:** I don't explicitly mention John's offer, but framing this as a final effort (""need to feel confident"") subtly implies there are limits to how far I'm willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in finding a common ground. My latest proposal is to purchase the product for $930,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers and is now at $930,000. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $940,000, continuing to push risks:

* **Bob walking away:** He might perceive me as inflexible, especially after multiple rounds. 
* **Wasting negotiation rounds:**  I have a limited number of rounds, and getting closer to John's offer might make it more tempting to just take the guaranteed deal. 

Accepting $930,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
