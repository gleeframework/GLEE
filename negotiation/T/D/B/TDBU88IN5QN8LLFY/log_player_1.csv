Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,000."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, securing a deal with Bob above $12,000 would be ideal.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob. 
    * It's significantly higher than his perceived value ($8,000), giving us room to negotiate down if needed.
    * It's still a compelling discount compared to what we're guaranteed from John. 

This approach aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
