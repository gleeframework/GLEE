"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9000. This would still give me a reasonable profit while allowing you to get a great deal on the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $8250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product.",8250.0,Bob,4,
