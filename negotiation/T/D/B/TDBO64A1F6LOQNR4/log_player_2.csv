"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. You have no information about the product's value to Alice, so there's potential for a much lower price.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows you to gather information and explore better deals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing your seriousness about negotiating. It's a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* **Information Gathering:**  This counteroffer will help you understand Alice's perceived value of the product.  If she accepts, it's a great deal. If she counters, it gives you more information to work with. 
* **Maintaining Options:**  You're still leaving the door open to walk away and buy from John if Alice's counteroffers become too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9000. This would still give me a reasonable profit while allowing you to get a great deal on the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still too high.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's likely still room for a lower price. Rejecting and counter-offering again will allow you to further test her limits and potentially reach a more favorable price.  Remember, John is always an option if negotiations break down completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** This counteroffer shows continued negotiation without being unreasonable. You're making a reasonable compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Middle Ground:** The $8,250 price is the middle ground between your previous offer ($7,500) and Alice's current offer ($9,000). This shows you're willing to be flexible but not willing to be taken advantage of. 
* **Gaining Information:** This will reveal if Alice is willing to budge further or if she's closer to her bottom line."
