"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating,  it's likely that Alice will be unwilling to drop below $900,000. It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John."
