"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product, as it's worth that much to me. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $780,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $820,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you considering it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $820,000. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
