"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. It's a compromise from my initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly higher than my fallback price with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is a decent price, I still believe I can get closer to my target price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still holding firm on a price that's above my minimum.  Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $85.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's only a few dollars below my fallback option with John, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to secure a sale at a reasonable price than risk losing the deal entirely."
