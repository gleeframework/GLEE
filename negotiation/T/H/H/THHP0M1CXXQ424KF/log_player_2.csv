"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

The offered price is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand your position, but $100 is too low for me.  Could you do $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",

This counter-offer splits the difference between her previous offer and my last one.  It shows I'm willing to compromise while still striving for a price within my budget."
