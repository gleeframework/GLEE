"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. You'll get a fantastic product at a price that's significantly lower than its true value to me. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. However, I do have another buyer who's ready to purchase it for $1,200,000. So, this offer is only valid for a limited time.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
