"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He wants to save as much money as possible and $11,500 is still above his target of $12,000.  It's worth seeing if he can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that? I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his maximum budget.  He can keep trying to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds left and he might be able to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $10,750? I think this is a fair compromise and lets us both get what we want."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,750 is close, but I need to get at least $10,900 for this to make sense for me.  Do you think we can make that work? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $10,900 is within his budget and is a much better deal than buying from John for $12,000. It's also likely that Alice won't go lower, as she has shown a willingness to compromise and this is getting close to her minimum."
