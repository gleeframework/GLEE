Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening position. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate. If he rejects outright, I can always go with John's offer of $800,000, ensuring I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try to push for a higher price. There's still potential for a better deal, and I'm willing to engage in another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and is significantly better than John's offer.  I'm going to accept this offer to secure a sale and maximize my profit."
