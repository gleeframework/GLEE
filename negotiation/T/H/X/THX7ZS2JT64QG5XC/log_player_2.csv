"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1500000. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it has. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still slightly higher than my preferred price point. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get it down to $1,200,000 or less.  If this offer fails, I'll buy from John."
