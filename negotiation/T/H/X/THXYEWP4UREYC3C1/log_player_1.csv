Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this right away. However, it sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how interested he truly is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price to $105, which is still above Bob's offer, but shows I'm willing to compromise. This should hopefully encourage Bob to come up in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject this offer.  It's risky to sell to John, as he's my safety net, but I believe I can squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. I'm coming down to $98, which is very close to his last offer. This should hopefully be enough to get him to agree, but if not, I'll have to go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm going to sell to John for $100. While it's not the ideal price, it's still above my minimum and guarantees a sale."
