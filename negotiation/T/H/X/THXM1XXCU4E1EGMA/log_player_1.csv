Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn a higher price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and professional, acknowledging the value of the product and inviting Bob to engage in a dialogue.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and maintaining a positive relationship with Bob.  By offering a price that is attractive but leaves room for negotiation, I increase the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but based on my assessment, I am willing to pay up to $850,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. There's still a potential to get closer to my desired price of $950,000. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can initiate a counter-offer and try to bridge the gap.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to be assertive but not aggressive. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also aware of the value of the product and my own minimum acceptable price.  This approach allows me to maintain some leverage and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective. However, $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  which is a significant compromise on my initial offer. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This counter-offer represents a compromise, moving halfway from my initial offer of $950,000 to Bob's offer of $850,000. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a significant margin above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:**  The message remains friendly and professional, acknowledging Bob's perspective while emphasizing the value of the product and my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while also signaling that I'm not desperate to sell.  By making a counter-offer that's closer to my initial price, I increase the likelihood of reaching a favorable outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I've carefully considered your latest offer and am willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, it's important to consider the risk of further negotiation.  If I reject his offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance he might walk away, forcing me to sell to John for $800,000.  

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit of $75,000, which is a reasonable outcome considering the potential risk of continued negotiation. It's a good compromise that secures a decent price while minimizing the chance of a worse outcome."
