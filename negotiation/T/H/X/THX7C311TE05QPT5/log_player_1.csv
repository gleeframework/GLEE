Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value of your product, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Given its worth to me, I'm prepared to offer $1100000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
