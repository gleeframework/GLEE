"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value of your product, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Given its worth to me, I'm prepared to offer $1100000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $1100000. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me is $1200000. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
