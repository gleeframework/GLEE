"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000, which I think is a fair and reasonable price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time. This is my maximum price point.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is my best price for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $16,000 is still above my budget.  However, it's a good sign she's willing to negotiate. I'm going to counteroffer again to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $16,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $14000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $17000. This is my final offer before considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $17,000 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement and wasting more time is high.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John for a guaranteed price of $12,000."
