"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to be happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000. I'd like to stick with my original offer of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that he won't go above $1,200,000. While this is my minimum acceptable price, I've already had two rounds of negotiation with Bob.  It's likely that he won't budge further, and I'm not confident I can get a better price.  It's in my best interest to accept John's offer and close the deal immediately."
