"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I had budgeted for. Would you consider $11,500? That's a fair offer, considering my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 might still be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
