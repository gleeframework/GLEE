"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be a great asset to your business.  It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's very fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $950,000.** This is still $150,000 more than what the product is worth to you.
* **John's offer is $1,000,000.** This is a higher price, but still within your budget and  only $200,000 more than what the product is worth to you.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to negotiate with John.** Even if you don't get a lower price from John, you can at least try.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice as it gives you the chance to negotiate a better price or, in the worst case, pay only $50,000 more to John than you would have paid Alice."
