Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and you have a guaranteed offer of $800,000 from John, there's a window for negotiation. 

Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation will likely result in a quick sale and a significant profit for you.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message is polite, professional, and hints at the product's value to Bob without revealing your bottom line.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 provides Bob with a substantial discount compared to his valuation, making it a highly appealing offer he is likely to accept. This price also nets you a $350,000 profit over John's offer. 

**Important:** This assumes you and Bob are the only parties involved in this negotiation. In a real-world scenario, additional factors like Bob's negotiation skills, market conditions, and the urgency of the sale could influence the outcome."
