"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  I understand the product's value, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still trying to stay close to my budget, and $1,000,000 is really the maximum I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to go that low?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,015,000. This is a very good price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm not sure I can go any lower than this. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,5,
