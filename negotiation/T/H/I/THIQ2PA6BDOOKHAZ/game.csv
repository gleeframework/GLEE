"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap from it.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,500,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,500,000 represents its full value, I understand your perspective. Let's meet closer to the middle. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
