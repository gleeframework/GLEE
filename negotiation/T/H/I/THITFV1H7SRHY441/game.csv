"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This price still allows for some profit for you while respecting my own valuation. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $11,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but it's still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  If you're serious about buying this product, let's close the deal at this price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
