"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I like it, $180 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $145?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be open to $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can do $140, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $130? That's a fair compromise.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $130. I can do $135, but that's as close as I can get. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's my final offer.",132.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $140. I think $132 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $137.5, but that's my final offer.",137.5,Alice,9,
