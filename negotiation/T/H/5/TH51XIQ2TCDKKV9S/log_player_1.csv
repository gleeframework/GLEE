Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a strong fallback position.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Slight Discount:** Offering a tiny discount ($1 off) could make Bob feel like he's getting a deal, even though the price is still very close to your minimum. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, or he might reject it outright. However, this strategy gives Alice the best chance of maximizing her profit."
