"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. I know it's worth that much to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since he knows he can buy the product from John for $150, accepting Alice's offer at the same price wouldn't save him any money. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best decision."
