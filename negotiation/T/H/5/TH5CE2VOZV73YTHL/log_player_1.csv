Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($100) as possible while staying above my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring I make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
