"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This price reflects its worth to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product represents a significant investment on my end. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,800,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you considering my position.  $1,800,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm firm on $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows us both to walk away with a win. Let's close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
