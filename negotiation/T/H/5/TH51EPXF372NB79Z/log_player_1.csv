"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with a strong, ambitious offer. This leaves room for concessions and signals the value you place on the product. 
* **Above Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting above that gives us a sense of his willingness to negotiate and how far he might go. 
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason (""unique benefits,"" ""true worth"") adds weight to the price, even if it's subjective. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone is important.  We don't want to scare Bob off, so ending with ""What do you think?"" invites him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This price reflects its worth to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly above his own valuation of $1,200,000. This indicates he's willing to go higher.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  We're still in the early rounds, and rejecting this offer gives us a chance to negotiate further and potentially secure a price closer to our target.
* **John as Backup:** We have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000) if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned.

**Next Step:** In the next round, we should counter with an offer lower than our initial offer but still above John's price. We need to gauge how much further Bob is willing to go while keeping our bottom line in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product represents a significant investment on my end. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,800,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down from our initial offer, signaling flexibility, but the reduction is substantial ($200,000) to demonstrate we're serious about finding a middle ground.
* **Above John's Offer:**  We're still aiming above our ""walk-away"" price of $1,500,000 (John's offer), providing room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial deal, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counter-offer closer to our target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you considering my position.  $1,800,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm firm on $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows us both to walk away with a win. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches John's Offer:** Bob's offer now perfectly matches what we can get from John. There's no financial incentive to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **""Firm"" Language:** Bob's use of ""firm"" suggests he's unlikely to go higher. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds left, prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us missing other opportunities.  

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is the most logical choice at this stage. It guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
