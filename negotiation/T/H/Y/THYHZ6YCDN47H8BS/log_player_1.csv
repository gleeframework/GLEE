"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $1,050,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can come to a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price to make this worthwhile for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've reviewed your latest offer, Alice. I'm still not able to meet your asking price. I would like to propose $1,075,000 as a compromise. I hope this proposal allows us to move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting and inching closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to risk another round and see if we can negotiate a higher price. I'm confident that with a strong counteroffer, I can secure a more favorable deal than selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not able to accept your offer.  $1,090,000 is the lowest I can go at this point.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to counter with $1,085,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget constraints.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,085,000 is getting close to my minimum and is still significantly higher than what John is offering. With only 4 rounds left, I believe it's in my best interest to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing out on a sale altogether."
