"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I agree that the product is valuable, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $800,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, $800,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",900000.0,Alice,5,
