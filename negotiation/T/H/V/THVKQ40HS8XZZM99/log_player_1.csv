Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and maximizes the potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is not excessively high, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too steep. This opens the door for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John. This knowledge allows you to be bolder in your initial ask."
