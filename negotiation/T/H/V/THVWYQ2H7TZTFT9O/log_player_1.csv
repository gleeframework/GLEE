Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $140.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100. 

By offering the product at $140, you're aiming to capture a significant portion of the value it holds for Bob while still exceeding your minimum selling price.  This leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a decent deal (saving $10), increasing the likelihood he'll accept."
