"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I recognize the value of the product,  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $10,500.  This price would allow me to make a worthwhile investment and hopefully, we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still looking for a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
