"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $7,800? That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $7,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $7,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",7500.0,Bob,6,
