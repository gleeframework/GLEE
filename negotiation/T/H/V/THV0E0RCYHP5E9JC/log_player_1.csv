"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:**  Highlighting the value of the product to him emphasizes the potential for profit.
* **Room for Compromise:**  While $1,750,000 is a significant markup, it allows for several rounds of counteroffers before reaching a price I find acceptable.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown a willingness to negotiate. I can likely secure a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a Backup:**  The possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage during negotiations, allowing me to hold out for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to work with you, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,600,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows you a good return on your investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to encourage Bob to consider a higher offer.
* **Win-Win Approach:**  The language ""Let's find a solution"" suggests a collaborative approach, making Bob more receptive to negotiation. 
* **Room for More Negotiations:**  $1,600,000 still leaves room for further concessions in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,400,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob's willingness to compromise shows that he's serious about acquiring the product. I can likely push him closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, giving me the leverage to be firm during negotiations with Bob.

I'm going to make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing you a good return on your investment. Let's close this deal and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession to show flexibility, but I'm staying firm close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Fairness & Value:**  I emphasize the fairness of the price and the value of the product to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Urgency & Closure:**  Phrases like ""Let's close this deal"" and ""make this happen"" create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This counteroffer balances my need to secure a decent price with the desire to close the deal. With John as a backup, I can afford to be firm while still showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,400,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $1,400,000 offer, and I've already conceded as much as I can comfortably. Further negotiation at this point is unlikely to yield a better result.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose out on a valuable opportunity. 
* **Time Constraint:** With limited rounds remaining, it's more strategic to secure a guaranteed sale to John rather than risk further negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome. 

While I would prefer to close a deal with Bob, the risk of a prolonged negotiation that doesn't lead to a profitable outcome is too high. It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John."
