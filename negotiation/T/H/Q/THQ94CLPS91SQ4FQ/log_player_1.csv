Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
