Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the potential value he'll gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly invites Bob to respond, setting the stage for a back-and-forth.
* **Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000, giving me leverage if negotiations with Bob stall or break down. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while remaining open to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  The fact that Bob countered indicates he's willing to negotiate. I can likely push him closer to my desired price.
* **John provides a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and have a stronger position to potentially secure a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Frame it as a ""fair compromise"":** This language subtly pressures Bob to see the offer as reasonable.
* **Maintain a higher price:** $11,000 is still significantly above Bob's initial offer but below my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Open the door for agreement:**  The message is friendly and focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while simultaneously pushing Bob closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my desired price, $10,200 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:** Bob's willingness to counteroffer indicates he's still interested in the product and potentially willing to increase his price. 
* **Selling to John is a strong fallback:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the power to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and can potentially secure a price closer to my desired outcome."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,200 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,700, which is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slightly lower price:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer. However, $10,400 is still a bit too far off from where I need to be.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10550}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm signaling this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Small concession:**  I'm only decreasing my offer by $150, showing I'm serious about getting a deal done but not giving up too much.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to encourage him to accept.
* **Direct question:** I'm directly asking for a response, pushing for a decision.

This counteroffer aims to reach a final agreement while still securing a price closer to my desired range.  Since I have John as a backup, I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to budge."
