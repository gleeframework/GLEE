Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so anything less is unacceptable.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Zone:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, leaving room for negotiation but without being ridiculously high that Bob walks away instantly.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair price for such a valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offer starts closer to your minimum but leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he negotiates you down.
* **Confident Language:** The wording emphasizes the product's value without being overly aggressive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't sound like a final ultimatum, making it easier for Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. Remember, you always have John's offer to fall back on!"
