I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives me a good margin over my minimum value, and hopefully, Bob will be interested.  If he rejects, I'll have to gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm going to counter with $13,000. It's a little higher than Bob's offer, but still a reasonable compromise.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and agree to this price."

Bob has moved up to $12,500.  That's a good price and a decent profit.  I'll accept his offer."
