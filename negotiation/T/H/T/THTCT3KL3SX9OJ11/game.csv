"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's try to find common ground. ",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $10,000.  If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I might have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision.",11500.0,Alice,7,
