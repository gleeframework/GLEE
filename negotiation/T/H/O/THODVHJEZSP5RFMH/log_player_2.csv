"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll choose to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $950,000. I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so I'd be saving $50,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John.
