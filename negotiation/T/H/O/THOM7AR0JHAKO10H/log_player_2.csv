"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay my asking price. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her asking price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option."
