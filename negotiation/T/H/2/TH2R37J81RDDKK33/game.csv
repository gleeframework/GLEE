"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to consider an offer of $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm still not getting the value I want for it. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm going to meet you at $1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in it.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
