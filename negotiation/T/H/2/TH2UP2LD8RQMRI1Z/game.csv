"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1100000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1075000. This is a fair offer, considering the product's value to me and my budget limitations. I'm confident we can find a compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1075000. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $1090000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  However, $1090000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1060000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to me and my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement on this final offer.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1060000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I propose a price of $1075000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
