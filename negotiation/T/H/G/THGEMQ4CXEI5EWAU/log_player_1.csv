"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This will give me some room to negotiate, but it's still a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below my target. I want to see if I can negotiate closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is closer to what I want, but still a bit lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $82 is just above my minimum price and is a fair deal considering the limited rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
