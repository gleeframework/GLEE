**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, his ""final offer"" is still $50,000 below my guaranteed sale price with John. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation, potentially for a smaller profit.  I can sell to John now and ensure I get my desired price."
