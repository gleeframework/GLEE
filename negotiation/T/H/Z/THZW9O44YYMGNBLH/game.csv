"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiating, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,600. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,600 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,700? I think this is a fair price for both of us. ",10700.0,Alice,5,
