"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could we agree on $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
