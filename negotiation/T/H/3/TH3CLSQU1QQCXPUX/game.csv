"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more so than my initial asking price. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, I'm still confident the true value of this product is higher.  Would you be willing to consider $1,950,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but I believe this price point better reflects the long-term benefits this product offers.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,900,000. Can we discuss this further?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
