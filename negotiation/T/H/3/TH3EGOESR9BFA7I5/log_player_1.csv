Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to bargain but not making the offer seem unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to secure a higher price closer to my initial goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further.  While $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you want to get a good price, and I'm happy to pay a fair amount. How about $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my desired price point. Accepting this offer will result in a sale that's above my minimum and within the acceptable range.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely outweighs the potential gain of a few hundred dollars."
