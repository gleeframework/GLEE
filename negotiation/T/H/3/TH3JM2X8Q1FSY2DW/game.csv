"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal. Given the value this product offers, I'm asking for $20,000 to start. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers a lot of value and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While the product is good, $17,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $14,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
