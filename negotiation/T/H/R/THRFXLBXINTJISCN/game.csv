"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a lower price than you'd find elsewhere, and I'm still able to make a good profit. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable going above that. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This way, we both get a good deal.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9,250. Can you consider this revised offer?",9250.0,Bob,4,
