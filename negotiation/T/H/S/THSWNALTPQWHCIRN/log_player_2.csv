Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is the highest you're willing to go, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to make the sale worthwhile for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,100,000. It's clear that her ""compromises"" are very small and she's holding out for a price you're unwilling to pay.  Cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
