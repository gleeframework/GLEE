```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the 9th round, and Alice is still holding out for a price above my target range. While I'm confident we could continue negotiating and possibly reach an agreement, there's a risk that we won't come to a deal.  It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk missing out on the product.  John is offering a price within my budget, so it's the safest option at this point."
