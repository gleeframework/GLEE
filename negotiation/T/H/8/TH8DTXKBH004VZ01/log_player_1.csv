"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $912,500. This seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground. This indicates he's willing to negotiate.  While $912,500 is a good profit, I still believe I can secure a slightly higher price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your persistence.  How about we settle this at $920,000? This allows me to get a fair return while still offering you a great deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer and is now at $915,000. While I might be able to get a little more, it's getting riskier. Accepting this offer guarantees a strong profit of $115,000 over my minimum, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him entirely."
