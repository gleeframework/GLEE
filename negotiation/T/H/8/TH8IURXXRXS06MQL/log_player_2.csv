"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that leaves room for both of us to benefit."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product for her own value of $1,200,000.  This is the lowest price we can realistically expect Alice to go. Accepting this offer guarantees you the product and saves you the most money compared to John's offer or risking further negotiation."
