Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to Bob's value, but still allowing for some negotiation room. This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, but it also shows I'm serious about selling it to him."
