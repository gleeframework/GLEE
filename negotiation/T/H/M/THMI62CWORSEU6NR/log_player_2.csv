"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm asking for $900000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still significantly higher than the $1,000,000 I'm willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, and it's always worth trying to get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still above my desired price point. I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000, but there's still some room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $815,000.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to $800,000, I'm still saving $185,000 compared to buying from John. It's likely that further negotiation won't get me a much better price, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product altogether. It's a good deal, and I'm happy to accept it."
