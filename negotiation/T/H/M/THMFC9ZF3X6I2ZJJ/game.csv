"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $1700000 is simply too low for me to consider.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1800000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's see if we can make this work.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
