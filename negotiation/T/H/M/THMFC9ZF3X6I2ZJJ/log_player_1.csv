``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value and potential to try and pique Bob's interest.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $1,700,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,800,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I reiterate that Bob's offer is unacceptable, but I also acknowledge his budget constraints.
* **Meet Halfway:**  I propose a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($1,900,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,700,000). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:**  I clearly state that this is the lowest price I can go, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use language like ""Let's see if we can make this work"" to keep the negotiation friendly and focused on finding a solution."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are only six rounds in, and there's a chance I could lose more time and money trying to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Guaranteed Value:** John offers a sure sale at my minimum, eliminating risk and ensuring I get at least $1,500,000 for the product.  

It's a tough decision, but given the time limit and the guarantee John offers, I'm choosing to sell to John."
