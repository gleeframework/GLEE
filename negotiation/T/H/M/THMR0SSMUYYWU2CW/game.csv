"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I see the value in the product,  $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 is below its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that $1,000,000 is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product. Let's close this deal at this point. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
