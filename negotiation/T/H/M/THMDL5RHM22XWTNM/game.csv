"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $850,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However,  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $650,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value and my current budget.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $650,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $725,000? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you and my own valuation. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"This is getting closer, Alice.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I do value the product. Would you be willing to close the deal at $680,000?",680000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to give up on my target price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $700,000? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you and my own valuation. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,7,
