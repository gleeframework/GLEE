(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing about the product's worth to her. She's trying to anchor you to a high price by claiming it's worth $1,500,000 to her. You know her minimum selling point is likely much lower ($1,200,000). By rejecting her initial offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price closer to her actual valuation.  You have the backup option of John at $1,500,000, so you don't risk losing the product entirely."
