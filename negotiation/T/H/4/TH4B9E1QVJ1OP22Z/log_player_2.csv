{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a lower price, but he doesn't want to risk losing the deal by being too aggressive. Offering $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,200 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial offer and significantly cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's within his budget and saves him $800 compared to John's offer."
