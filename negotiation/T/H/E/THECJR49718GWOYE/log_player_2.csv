"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. While I cannot disclose specifics about the product at this time, I assure you it's worth no less than $1000000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a price that reflects both the value I place on the product and the potential benefits I believe it offers you. If you're interested, we can schedule a time to discuss further details. However, I'm confident in the product's value and I'm prepared to sell it to another buyer for $1000000 if you decline this offer.
