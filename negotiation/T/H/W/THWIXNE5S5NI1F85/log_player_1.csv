{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point:** It's a fair price that leaves room for negotiation, yet is still significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $12,000.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value the product offers to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I explicitly state that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  I'm starting high, hoping to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value of $15,000.
* **Maintain control:** By starting the negotiation, I set the initial terms and can gauge Bob's interest.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  Having John's offer of $12,000 provides a safety net, ensuring I don't end up with a price lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but my budget is limited to $12,000 for this purchase. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By showing I'm not desperate to sell at his price, I encourage him to consider a higher offer.
* **Explore potential for a better deal:** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my desired price. A counteroffer might lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Avoid settling for the minimum:**  Accepting Bob's offer immediately would leave money on the table.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and increase the chances of securing a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to reduce my asking price to $13,000.  This is a significant reduction, and I believe it still reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and value:** I acknowledge Bob's budget, but emphasize that the product still holds significant value.
* **Significant reduction:**  A $1,000 drop shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive and open:** The message is encouraging, aiming to foster continued negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a better price:**  A $13,000 price is closer to my target than Bob's initial offer.
* **Signal flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a fair value for my product. 
* **Maintain momentum:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward."
