"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it, but I need to let you know that I'm looking for $180 to part with it. Would you be interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
