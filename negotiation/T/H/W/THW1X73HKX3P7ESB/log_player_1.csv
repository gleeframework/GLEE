Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net at $800,000, Bob values the product much higher at $1,500,000. Our goal is to capture as much of that value as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly justifies the high price by highlighting the product's value specifically to Bob (""your expertise"", ""significant return on investment"").

**Important Note:** This is an initial offer. We need to be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he rejects the first proposal."
