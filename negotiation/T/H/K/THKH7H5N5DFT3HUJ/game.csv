"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I can meet you halfway at $1,000,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Let's see if we can find a compromise. My counteroffer is $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. My next counteroffer is $1,020,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000 yet. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $1,005,000, and that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",1005000.0,Alice,7,
