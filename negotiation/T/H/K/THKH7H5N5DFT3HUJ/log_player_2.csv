"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's a good idea to start by rejecting Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than your goal, and you want to establish a lower starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I can meet you halfway at $1,000,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Let's see if we can find a compromise. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down a bit, but it's still above your ideal price.  Reject and counter-offer again to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. My next counteroffer is $1,020,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to your target price, but you're still $20,000 away.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a bit further before potentially going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000 yet. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $1,005,000, and that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's getting close, but Alice is still holding out for a higher price.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation is high, and you're only $5,000 away from your ideal price with John. It's better to buy from John and avoid the risk of Alice's next counteroffer."
