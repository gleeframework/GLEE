Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum price:**  You're aiming for more than your $100 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  There's room for negotiation, making it more likely Bob will accept or at least counteroffer. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  This sets a positive tone for the interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum:** You're still making a profit, but you can likely get closer to your desired price.
* **There's room to negotiate:**  Even if you reject Bob's offer, he's shown interest. You can likely find a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is less profitable:** While selling to John is guaranteed, you'll earn less than you could potentially earn with Bob. 

**Next steps:** You'll need to craft a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $108? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's but lower than your initial offer:** This shows you're willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Message is positive and encouraging:** The goal is to keep the negotiation going and hopefully reach a deal.
* **Price is closer to Bob's desired price:** This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $107? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above your minimum:**  You're still earning more than your $100 minimum.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more:** Bob has shown he's not willing to go higher, and you've already conceded quite a bit.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject Bob's offer and he walks away, you're left with selling to John for $100.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale at a decent price, avoiding the risk of a failed negotiation and a lower price from John."
