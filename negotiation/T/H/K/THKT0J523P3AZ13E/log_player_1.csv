Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $14,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $16,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $16000. How about $13500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offers are getting progressively lower, and I'm concerned that we might not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $15,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer and closer to my minimum."
