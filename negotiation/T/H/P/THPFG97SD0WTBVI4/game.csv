"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a pretty good deal for this product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $95. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm happy to buy the product from you.",95.0,Bob,4,
