Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This sets a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Unknown:** Since I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, I'm aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  By having John as an alternative buyer, I can comfortably walk away if Bob's counteroffers become too low. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Higher Value Potential:**  While $900,000 is a good price, I believe there's still potential to earn more, given that my minimum is $800,000.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially drive the price higher.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Having John as an alternative buyer ensures that I'm not taking unnecessary risks. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm counter-offering at $1,000,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Maintaining Upper Hand:**  By staying above $900,000, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at that price.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still giving me a good chance of getting a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is only a small increase from his previous offer of $900,000. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  It's likely that further negotiation will only yield a small increase in price. Accepting this offer secures a sale at a price significantly higher than my minimum. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and potentially lead to a lower price if Bob decides to walk away. 

Selling at $920,000 is a good outcome, and I'm happy to close the deal."
