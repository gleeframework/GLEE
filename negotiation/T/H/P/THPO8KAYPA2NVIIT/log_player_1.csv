"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm willing to push for a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I think I can still push for more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's valuation, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, I can get closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my target, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. It's worth risking another round to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise, but I think it's within a reasonable range for both of us. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. This is the price John is willing to pay, so it's a safe bet for me. I've managed to negotiate a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
