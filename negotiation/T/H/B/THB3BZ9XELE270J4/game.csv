"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm interested, I'm not quite ready to pay $12000. I'm willing to offer $10000. I believe this is a fair price, considering your value for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $11000? This is a fair price considering the value you placed on the product and my minimum price. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $10500? I'm confident we can reach an agreement that's fair to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
