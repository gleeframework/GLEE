"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for this product, considering its value. It's a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $10,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This would be a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
