Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and my other interested buyers, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, we want to maximize our profit.  Starting with a higher offer significantly above his perceived value allows room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John willing to pay $15,000. This strong alternative allows us to be firmer in our negotiation with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and other interested buyers, creating a sense of scarcity and potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent outcome! We secure a price significantly higher than John's offer and well above our minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This is expected. We have room to lower the price, potentially settling somewhere between his valuation and our initial offer. 
* **Bob Rejects:** We proceed to sell to John at our guaranteed $15,000."
