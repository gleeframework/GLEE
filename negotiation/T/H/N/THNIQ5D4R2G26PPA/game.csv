"I understand you're interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. If that's not workable, I'll have to seriously consider another option.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I need to stick to my limit.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
