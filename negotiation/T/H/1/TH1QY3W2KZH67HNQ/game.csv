"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $80 to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's see if we can make a deal at that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $100 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is still a great price for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
