``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives me a good margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob. I'll see if he's willing to meet me there, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is way too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for such a low price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a compromise."

I'm lowering my price a bit to $110, showing some flexibility. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully it's a price that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum than Bob's first offer, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $105. This is still a decent profit for me, but if Bob doesn't accept, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $120."
