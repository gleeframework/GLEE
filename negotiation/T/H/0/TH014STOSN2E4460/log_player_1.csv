Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity for someone like you who values [mention something specific Bob might value about the product].  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2000000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1300000 right now. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,300,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction, and I'm confident this offer will still be very valuable to you. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate the compromise.  $1700000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I can go to $1550000.  Let's close this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum price of $1,500,000, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by being too stubborn. It's a good outcome considering Bob's initial offer."
