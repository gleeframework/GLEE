"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity for someone like you who values [mention something specific Bob might value about the product].  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's budget.  There's no reason to accept it immediately. Bob should reject the offer and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,000,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1,300,000 right now. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1300000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1700000. This is a significant reduction, and I'm confident this offer will still be very valuable to you. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There's also the option of buying from John at a lower price if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate the compromise.  $1,700,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I can go to $1,550,000.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1550000}
