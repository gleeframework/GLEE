Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $750,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still confident in its value. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good compromise.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's only $25,000 more than my counteroffer and significantly less than what I'd pay John.  It's in my best interest to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
