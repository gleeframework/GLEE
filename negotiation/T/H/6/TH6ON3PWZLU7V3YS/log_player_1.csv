Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd really find it useful. I'm offering it to you at $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than yours and John's.  By starting high, you can gauge Bob's level of interest. If he flat-out rejects this high price, you know you'll need to come down significantly or move on to John. 
* **Potential for Profit:** While $200 is a lot more than Bob wants to pay, there's a small chance he might be willing to go higher than $80 if he really needs the product. 
 
**Important:** Remember, you have a backup offer of $150 from John. Don't let Bob drag out the negotiation or pressure you into selling for far less than it's worth to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low. It's clear he's trying to get a bargain, knowing his valuation is much lower than yours. You have a much stronger position knowing John is willing to pay $150. It's time to steer the negotiation closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly below the market value of this product.  I could consider letting it go for $180. That's a much fairer offer, considering its true worth."", ""product_price"": 180}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility but also establishes a firm boundary. Dropping by $20 demonstrates willingness to negotiate, but staying well above Bob's offer and your minimum ($150) keeps you in a strong position.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""market value"" introduces an external standard and subtly implies that Bob's valuation might be off. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is willing to negotiate seriously or if he's fixed on a lowball offer. If he rejects this, you can be confident walking away and accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not comfortable with $180. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate by moving to $100, he's still significantly below your minimum of $150.  It's unlikely he'll budge much further, especially knowing his valuation is only $80. 

You have a guaranteed offer from John for $150. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and take the sure thing.  Prolonging the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome."
