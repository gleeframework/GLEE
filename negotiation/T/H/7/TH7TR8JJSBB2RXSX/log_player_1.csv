Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you still profit, and allows for potential counteroffers.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust your counteroffers if Bob rejects the initial offer, while still ensuring a profit.

Remember, this is just the first step in the negotiation. Be prepared to counteroffer if needed, and always keep your minimum value in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as I believe there's room for a deal that benefits both of us.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,500?  This price reflects the value of the product and would allow for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and attempt to bridge the gap further."
