"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,500,000. How about we try $1,475,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1475000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,475,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise, however.  I'm prepared to accept $1,525,000. This price reflects the value of the product, while still allowing you to secure it within your budget.",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,500,000 and $1,525,000, which would be $1,512,500. This is my final offer.",1512500.0,Bob,6,
