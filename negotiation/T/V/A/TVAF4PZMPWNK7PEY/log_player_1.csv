Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point."

This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $9000? This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's worth and the value I'll gain from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

This is a good deal for me. I've been able to get a price closer to my desired range and it's significantly better than selling to John. I'm willing to accept Bob's offer."
