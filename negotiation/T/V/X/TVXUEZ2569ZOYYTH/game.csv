"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and your desired selling price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle on $1,300,000?  This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still above my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while staying within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
