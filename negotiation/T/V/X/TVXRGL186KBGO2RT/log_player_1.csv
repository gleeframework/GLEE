Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob, incentivizing him to accept a price closer to my ideal outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer.  While selling to John for $10,000 is tempting, I believe I can still secure a better price from Bob. His offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's willingness to pay more than $9,500, while still being closer to my minimum acceptable price.  By meeting him halfway, I aim to keep the negotiations moving forward and hopefully secure a deal closer to my ideal outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, this offer meets my minimum acceptable price and is a reasonable outcome. Continuing negotiations risks delaying the sale and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
