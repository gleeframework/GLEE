Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a strategic offer:

* **Higher than your minimum:** It aims to earn you more than the guaranteed $12,000 from John.
* **Not too high:**  $15,000 is a reasonable price to start negotiations, leaving room for potential haggling. 

**Reasoning:** 

By offering a price higher than your minimum, you create an incentive for Bob to accept the offer. If he values the product more than $15,000, he'll be motivated to buy it from you.  If he doesn't, you can still sell it to John for a decent profit."
