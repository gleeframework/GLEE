"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While it sounds like a great product, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can meet you halfway at $8,500.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I can do $8,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's the minimum I need to make it worth my while.",8000.0,Alice,5,
