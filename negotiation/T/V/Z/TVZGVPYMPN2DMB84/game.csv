"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify paying $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $600,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to facilitate this deal. This price still allows for a healthy profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I could potentially go up to $700,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering the market value and my own budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options. ",850000.0,Alice,5,
