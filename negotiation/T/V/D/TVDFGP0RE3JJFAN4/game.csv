"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it still leaves you with a great value.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,200? That's the maximum I can afford, and I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection.",12200.0,Bob,4,
