Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and the possibility of a counteroffer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Not too high:** It's important to avoid scaring Bob away with an extremely high offer.  
* **Not too low:**  We want to maximize our profit. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, we can adjust our offer based on his counteroffer.
* **Provides context:** We emphasize the value of the product for Bob.

This strategy allows us to be flexible while still prioritizing our goal of earning as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below the $12,000 value to Bob. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation.  While Bob is on a tight budget, I can try to meet him halfway with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is the safest option:**  If the negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for my minimum price. However, I want to exhaust negotiation options first to see if I can get a better price.

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it still leaves you with a great value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlight the value:** I remind Bob that $13,000 is still a good price for him, given the product's value.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still above Bob's offer, but not too far away, creating an opportunity for a successful negotiation.

This approach is a balancing act: I need to show flexibility to keep Bob engaged, but I also want to secure a price that's close to my desired minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,200? That's the maximum I can afford, and I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,200 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for future deals:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and potentially build a relationship with Bob for future transactions.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer and forcing me to sell to John at my minimum price.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice. It secures a sale at a price that is still above the product's value to him, and it keeps the door open for potential future negotiations with Bob."
