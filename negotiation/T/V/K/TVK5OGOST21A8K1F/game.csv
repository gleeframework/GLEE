"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm on a tight budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can you meet me at this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I hope you'll consider this offer seriously.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $850000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
