"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10200. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I still think $10200 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be mindful of your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product for $10000.

"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9600. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer the product for $9800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for you.",9800.0,Alice,7,
