Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:** I want to maximize my earnings, so I aim for a price as close to Bob's value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Risk:** I'm taking a calculated risk. While I could offer closer to $1,200,000 and potentially get a higher price, there's a chance Bob might reject it. 
* **Safety Net:** My offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000, providing me with a safety net if Bob rejects.

This strategy balances maximizing potential earnings with the risk of losing a sale and the comfort of having a backup buyer."
