# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,800. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,800 is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price of $12,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product while saving a considerable amount of money.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential savings."
