"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a clear case of rejecting the offer. $200 is far above your maximum budget of $120. You'll want to counteroffer or look at John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

$175 is still too high for my budget. I'll reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  $110 is still within my budget and hopefully compelling enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll reject and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

I'm going up a bit, but I'm still below my limit. I'm hoping Alice is getting more flexible at this point."
