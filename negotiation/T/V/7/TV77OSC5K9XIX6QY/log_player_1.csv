Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but the price you're offering is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $125 is a good price for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable price, it's not moving fast enough. It's unlikely he'll go above $115, and I'd rather take the guaranteed $120 from John."
