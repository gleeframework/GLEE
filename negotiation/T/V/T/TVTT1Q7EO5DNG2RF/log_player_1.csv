Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate down, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$8,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the product for such a low price. I'll counter with a higher offer, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping it well above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to counter with a higher offer, but I'm starting to consider John's offer as a real possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $10,000. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John."
