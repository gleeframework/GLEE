"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $150.  Offering $120 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and might be tempting enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $130, which is within Bob's acceptable range of $150.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject the counteroffer and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer at $130 is the most financially sound decision in this situation."
