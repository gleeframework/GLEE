Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a unique opportunity to acquire something of significant worth."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $925,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still securing a price well above your minimum. 
* **Justify the Price:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he might be for the product. In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about the buyer can lead to a more tailored and potentially more profitable approach."
