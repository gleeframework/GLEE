Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,750,000.  I believe this price is fair given the value we both see in it, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.
