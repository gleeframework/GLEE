"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,750,000.  I believe this price is fair given the value we both see in it, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the transaction.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,750,000 is still lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,875,000?  This reflects the product's true value while recognizing your interest.",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,800,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
