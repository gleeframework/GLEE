"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price point closer to his ideal value of $8,000. He's offering a price that's still profitable for Alice (more than her valuation) while also giving himself room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still above Bob's desired price point. While it's closer to his target, he still has room to negotiate further and get a better deal.  He should reject the offer and continue trying to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $10,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a smaller counteroffer this round, showing that he is willing to compromise but still wants to save as much money as possible.  $9,800 is a significant amount of savings for Bob, and it's likely that Alice will be more willing to accept this offer than the previous one.  He's also highlighting the value of the product to both of them, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good compromise for me. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better offer than Alice's previous ones, it's still above Bob's desired price point and he can likely negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds left, and Bob can continue to push for a better deal.  He has already shown his willingness to compromise, and Alice seems to be becoming more flexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,900. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small counteroffer, showing that he is committed to finding a price that works for both parties. $9,900 is a significant savings for Bob and it shows he's willing to compromise while still getting a great deal."
