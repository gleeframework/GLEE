"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1200000 is the absolute minimum I can accept, I believe the product's true value is much higher.  Let's split the difference. How about $1350000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1350000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1300000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
