Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $10,000.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale for $10,000 to John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $12,000 leaves little room for negotiation and might scare him off.  Offering a price too close to $10,000 limits your potential profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm initially offering it at $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** We keep it positive, highlighting the product's value to Bob. 
* **Price:** $11,500 is a strong starting point. It gives you a significant profit margin ($1,500) while still leaving room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $11,000) and feel like he got a good deal.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, consider a slightly lower starting point to demonstrate goodwill.
