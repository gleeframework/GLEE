Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. This is a great deal for something of this quality.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""quality,""  Alice subtly justifies the high price without revealing her own minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While this offer might lead to Bob rejecting it outright, it also has the potential to secure a much higher profit than selling to John.
* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know much about Bob's negotiation style. A very assertive Bob might be turned off by an initial offer this high.  

This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and knowledge of Bob, other offers might be more suitable."
