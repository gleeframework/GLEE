"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good value, Bob. However, I have to say that $9000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we compromise at $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. However, $10500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $11500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about we try $11000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I think we're really close to a deal. How about we meet at $11750? It's a great price for you, and it's still a good deal for me.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $11375?",11375.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11750, Bob. I think that's the best price I can offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to consider other options. How about we stick with $11750?",11750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious offer of $11375, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'd like to finalize the deal at this price.",11375.0,Bob,10,
