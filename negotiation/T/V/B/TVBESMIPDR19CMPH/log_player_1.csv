Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This price still gives you a good deal considering your value for the product. Let's find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for a slightly higher price.  It's time to close the deal."
