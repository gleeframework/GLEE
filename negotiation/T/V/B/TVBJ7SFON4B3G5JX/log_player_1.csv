Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum asking price of $80. I'll see if I can get him to budge a little in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $82.50?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $82.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $78.  Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $78 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go down to $80 for the product.  That's my absolute minimum, but I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 80}
