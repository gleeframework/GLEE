"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000 to make this deal work. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle, what do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9500. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10250.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and you to get the product within your budget.  Let's finalize this deal â€“ I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is the price I was originally considering buying the product from John for. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
