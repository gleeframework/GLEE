"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows some room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $100. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110,  a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm dropping my price to $105.  This is another compromise, but it's still above my minimum.  I believe Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, we only have 4 rounds left and I'm not sure he's going to budge further. It's getting risky to continue negotiating. I'm going to sell the product to John for $100 to ensure I get my minimum price."
