Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a better price than John's offer, while also not scaring Bob away with an unreasonable initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm not happy with Bob's low offer, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my initial price. This shows some flexibility while still aiming for a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It seems like Bob is firm on his offer and isn't willing to budge. While I'd like to get more, I'm not willing to risk losing the sale altogether. John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, so it's the safest option at this point."
