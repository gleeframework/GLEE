"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is a special offer considering the value it holds for us and its relevance to your needs. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, my budget for this product is $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer, but I must maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I propose a price of $10,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's closer to his target price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to accept that offer and avoid any further potential delays or complications with Alice."
