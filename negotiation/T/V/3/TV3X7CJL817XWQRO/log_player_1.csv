"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm going to need $10,000 to make this work. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. I think that's a more reasonable price, considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too far off from what I want. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a much better deal with John."
