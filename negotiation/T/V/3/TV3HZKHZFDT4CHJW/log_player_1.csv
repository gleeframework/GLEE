Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is higher than your minimum price of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is lower than the product's worth to Bob ($120), giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is direct and highlights the value for Bob.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is above your minimum price of $80, you can still potentially get a better price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price and potentially secure a higher profit.  

The negotiation process is ongoing, and you have the opportunity to try and close the gap between your expectations and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more than $85 for the product.  Given its value to you, how about we settle on $95? This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  The $95 offer is a compromise between your previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Highlighting value:** The message reiterates the product's value to Bob while still presenting a compelling offer.
* **Negotiation space:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while staying above your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is a fair compromise and meets your goal of earning more than your minimum price of $80.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and secures a decent profit. Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob rejecting your counteroffer and potentially walking away is significant.  

At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible option to maximize your earnings while minimizing risk."
