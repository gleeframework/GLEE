"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the chance to own this unique item, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be happy to purchase it for $12,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is still lower than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject any lower counteroffer and Bob will be left with no choice but to buy from John.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a lower price than John."
