"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price. You want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $11,500? This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my ideal price, but $11,500 is still above my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it ensures I can stay within my spending limit.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. How about we try $11,250? This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is only $250 more than my last counteroffer.  At this point, the difference is small enough that it's not worth continuing to negotiate. I'm getting a good deal compared to buying from John, and it's likely I won't get a significantly better price from Alice."
