"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a tight budget. Can you consider meeting me at $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget at $82.50. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,
