Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $20,000 is a strong opening price. It leaves room for negotiation and ensures I'm not immediately giving away too much value.
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the ""unique"" nature of the product implies it holds a higher potential value for Bob.
* **Open-ended Message:** I'm not being pushy or setting a deadline. This allows Bob to consider the offer carefully and potentially come back with a counteroffer.
* **Plan B:**  Remembering that John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net and sets a minimum acceptable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000. That's my top limit.  Let me know if you're willing to work with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's not even close to my initial asking price, and accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Bob is clearly interested, and while his initial offer is unacceptable, he has shown willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Counteroffer Opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially finding a middle ground that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range while still being open to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than I anticipated, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm proposing a price of $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still reflects the unique value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my desired range but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Compromise:**  By stating this is a ""significant reduction"" from my initial offer, I emphasize my willingness to compromise.
* **Value Reiteration:**  Mentioning the product's ""unique value"" reminds Bob of the potential benefits he'll gain by acquiring it.
* **Open-Ended:**  The message encourages further discussion, signaling I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit more than I can manage. Let's split the difference and go with $10000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Compromise:**  Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by meeting me halfway between our last offers.
* **Potential for Profit:** While it's not my ideal price, accepting his offer still allows me to make a profit.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** Rejecting his offer might lead to further negotiation, but it also risks losing the deal altogether. 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option. It's a fair compromise that ensures I make a decent profit and secures the sale."
