"Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000. That's my top limit.  Let me know if you're willing to work with that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than I anticipated, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm proposing a price of $12000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still reflects the unique value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit more than I can manage. Let's split the difference and go with $10000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the outcome.",10000.0,Bob,4,
