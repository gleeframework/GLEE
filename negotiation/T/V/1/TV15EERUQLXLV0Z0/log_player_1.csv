Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is much higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, and it's below Bob's perceived value.  I'm confident he'll counteroffer, and then we can haggle from there. If he rejects outright, I can either lower my price or move on to John."
