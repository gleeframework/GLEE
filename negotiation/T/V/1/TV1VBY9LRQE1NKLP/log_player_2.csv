Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal at $1,225,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

We're getting close, but there's still room for negotiation. Alice is coming down in price, indicating she's willing to make a deal. Let's see if we can push a bit further."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a deal at $1,200,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough call! Alice is clearly very intent on getting at least $1.2 million. We're running out of rounds to negotiate. 

Let's analyze:

* **Accept:** We get the product for $200,000 more than John's price.
* **Reject/Counter:** We risk Alice becoming firmer in her stance. We might not get much lower. 
* **Buy From John:**  Guarantees the best price but ends negotiation with Alice.

It's a gamble either way. I'm leaning towards taking the sure thing at this point.
