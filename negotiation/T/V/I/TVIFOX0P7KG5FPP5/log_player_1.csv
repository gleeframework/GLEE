"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll reap."",
""product_price"": 950000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and holding firm for a higher price is strategically advantageous."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and so am I. This product represents a significant investment for you, but it also delivers extraordinary value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Show firmness:**  By stating ""final offer,"" we increase the pressure on Bob, signaling our willingness to walk away.
* **Strategic concession:** A $50,000 drop shows flexibility but maintains a strong position above Bob's valuations.
* **Highlight value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's ""extraordinary value"" reinforces its worth above a simple price tag."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below your last offer. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has countered with the same offer twice, and also declared it his ""final offer.""  This signals a potential dead end in negotiations.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's standing offer provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a significant profit margin. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has diminishing returns. Each round carries the risk of a stalemate, while we have a bird-in-hand offer from John.

It's strategically wiser to secure the guaranteed profit with John than to risk a lower outcome by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
