Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer Alice should make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made if you sell to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation increases the chances of him accepting. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price:** The offered price of $1,150,000 gives you a $150,000 profit margin, which is a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the value to Bob and the fairness of the price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. Be prepared to counter or potentially walk away if his counteroffer doesn't meet your minimum acceptable profit margin."
