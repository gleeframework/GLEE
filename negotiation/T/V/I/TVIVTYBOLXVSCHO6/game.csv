"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $9500.  This is a great deal for both of us - you'll get a fantastic product for a price below its value to you, and I'll get a fair price for something that's important to me.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
