"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate and leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm starting with a positive and friendly tone, which is important for building rapport. 
* **Unique Value:** Mentioning the product is unique is a subtle way to try and pique Bob's interest and potentially increase its perceived value to him.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy for the following rounds. If he rejects, I'll likely lower my price but not by too much. If he makes a counteroffer, I'll evaluate it against my minimum and decide whether to accept or counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Accepting his offer would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's low offer is discouraging, I believe there is room for negotiation.  He's expressed interest, and I can try to meet him halfway. 
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:** Having John's offer of $10,000 provides a safety net.  If I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, I can always sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his offer of $9,000 and my initial asking price of $15,000. My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the unique value of this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm trying to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my initial asking price.  $12,000 represents a significant discount for me, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the unique value of the product to try and justify my price. 
* **Compromise Language:**  Using phrases like ""willing to come down"" and ""fair considering the unique value"" demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining some leverage. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's reaction to my counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John. 
* **Adjust Strategy:**  If Bob's counteroffer is closer to $12,000, I'll be more open to a deal. If it's significantly lower, I might consider a lower counteroffer or start thinking about selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'm not getting my ideal price, there's a chance I could potentially negotiate a bit higher in future rounds. However, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price is significant.
* **Time is Limited:** We're already in Round 4, and I only have 10 rounds total.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale, and with each passing round, the likelihood of finding a better buyer decreases.

**Next Steps:**

While I'm accepting Bob's offer for now, I will keep John's offer in mind as a safety net. If future rounds don't yield a better price, I'll always have the option to sell to him."
