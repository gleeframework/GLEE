"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to pay more than his perceived value of the product ($120). Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a better offer from Bob. Since John is offering the same amount as Bob, it makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation rounds."
