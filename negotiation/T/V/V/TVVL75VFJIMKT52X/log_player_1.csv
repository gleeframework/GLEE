Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation of $120. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Optional):**  While not strictly necessary in this scenario, offering $119 instead of $120 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he got a slight deal if he's prone to negotiation.
* **Secure the Higher Sale:** Even if Bob tries to negotiate down, it's unlikely he'd go below $100, ensuring Alice still gets a better price than selling to John."
