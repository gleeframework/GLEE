"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know the value is much higher for you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  There's a good chance Alice will come back with a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving money. You can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000 if needed."
