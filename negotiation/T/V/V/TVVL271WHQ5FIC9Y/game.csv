"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to do $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $9,250?  This still gives you a significant discount, and it's a fair price for me.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
