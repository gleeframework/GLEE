"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to do $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming for the $8,000 price John offers.  
* **Counteroffer Rationale:**  A $8,500 counteroffer is a strong starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Bob doesn't want to immediately go for his absolute maximum, as that might give Alice no incentive to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $9,250?  This still gives you a significant discount, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Bob's goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally $8,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** While $9,250 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Bob has a few more rounds to try and get closer to his target price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  The $9,000 offer is closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating that he's taking her perspective into account.
* **Staying Within Budget:** $9,000 is still within Bob's budget, but it's getting close to his maximum.
* **Leaving Room:**  The counteroffer is not Bob's absolute minimum, leaving some room for Alice to negotiate further if she wants."
