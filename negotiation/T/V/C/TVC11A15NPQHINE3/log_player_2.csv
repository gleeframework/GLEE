{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $110.** This is within your budget of $120.
* **Buying from John would cost you $120.** 
* **Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $10.**

It's always a good strategy to accept a lower price, even if it's only slightly lower, if it's within your budget."
