"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice is asking for $115. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You can always go to John if you can't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's value ($100) but still within my budget. 
* This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate, while still trying to save money. 
* It leaves room for Alice to counter if needed, but hopefully, it's a price she'll find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counter-offer is still too high.** While closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I have several rounds remaining, and there's a chance Alice might come down further.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option.**  I can always go to John if I can't get a better deal with Alice, but I'm willing to keep trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to the middle:** My previous offer of $110 was rejected, so I'm moving slightly closer to Alice's offer of $117. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Still within my budget:** $112 is still within my maximum price of $120, so I'm not sacrificing my own financial goals.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further. If she accepts, I've secured a good deal. If she rejects, I'll have more information to inform my next offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:**  Alice's last offer was $118, and my last offer was $112. This offer meets in the middle, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer is close to my maximum, but it's a final attempt to see if Alice is willing to accept a price closer to my budget.
* **Running out of time:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and I need to start closing the deal if possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at my maximum:** While I'm willing to pay $120, I don't want to go any higher.
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 7, and there's not much room for further negotiation.
* **John offers the same price:** Since John is also willing to sell for $120, there's no benefit to continuing to negotiate with Alice.

It's better to secure the product now from John and avoid the risk of Alice continuing to hold out for a higher price in the remaining rounds."
