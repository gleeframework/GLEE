"Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about offering $17000?",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $17000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $19500? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",19500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $19000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",19000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $19500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",19500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go below $20000, to be honest. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $20000, but that's as low as I can go. It's the best I can do.",20000.0,Alice,9,
