"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the value the product brings to the table.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
