"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
I'm starting with my maximum value, as I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay that amount.  This will set the baseline for negotiations and hopefully encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum. I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so there's no reason to settle for less at this point. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate but also indicates that I'm not desperate to sell.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough. My backup option with John guarantees me $1,200,000, so there's no need to rush into a lower deal. I'll continue to negotiate and try to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I want to avoid losing too much money, and with John's guaranteed $1,200,000, I have the luxury of continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm going to keep narrowing the gap, offering a price that's just above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us, and with each round, we're getting closer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

We're very close, but I'm still going to reject.  I'm not quite at my minimum yet, and it's important to hold out for a deal that feels fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1012500}
```

I'm offering a price in the middle of our last two offers. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying slightly above my minimum. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to finally agree to a deal."

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call.  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
