{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a truly valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great fit for your needs. My starting price is $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
This offer starts high, aiming for a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product.  It also sets a positive tone and emphasizes the product's value, hoping to make Bob more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still significantly lower than my ideal goal. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to secure a better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my initial price point to make this work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to achieve my target."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$950,000 is closer to my minimum than John's offer, but I still want to see if I can get closer to my initial goal.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $950,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to John's offer, but it's still not close enough to my minimum.  We're running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale with John.  I'll sell to John and secure the $800,000."
