Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still not quite comfortable with $103.50, but I'm willing to make one more move. How about we meet at $108? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $108.  It's clear she's comfortable letting the negotiations go down to the wire.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible and you have a standing offer for $150 from John, it makes more sense to take that deal rather than risk Alice not budging further and ending up empty-handed."
