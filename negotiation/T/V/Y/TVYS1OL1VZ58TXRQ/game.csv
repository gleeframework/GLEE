,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8,200. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8200.0,Alice,5,
