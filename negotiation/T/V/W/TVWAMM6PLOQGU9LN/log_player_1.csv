"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly suggesting the price is justified. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is polite and indicates I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.

By starting high, I aim to:

1. **Anchor:**  Influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 
2. **Gather Information:** Observe Bob's reaction to this initial price to understand his negotiation style and willingness to pay. 
3. **Maximize Profit:**  Potentially secure a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $2,250,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). I have room to negotiate and John's offer provides a safety net. I'll counter-offer in the next round to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. Considering the true value of this product and its potential to benefit your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial price but still staying well above both my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while emphasizing the product's value.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value proposition, directly tying it to potential benefits for Bob's business. This aims to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer seeks a middle ground.  The goal is to move the negotiation closer to a price point where I maximize profit while still being potentially acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, it's risky. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but this offer is already a compromise on his part.  

Accepting this offer guarantees I achieve my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
