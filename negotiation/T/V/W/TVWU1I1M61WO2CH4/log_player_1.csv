{
""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, at least $1,000,000. I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a price that will prove to be a wise investment on your end."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, but we don't know his upper limit.  A significantly higher offer tests his willingness to pay a premium.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the mutual value of at least $1,000,000, we anchor the price in that range and then attempt to push it higher.
* **Fallback Option:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer.

**Important Note:**  This is a very aggressive opening offer.  There's a chance it could turn Bob off.  However, it maximizes the potential profit if he's willing to accept a high price."
