Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but we also want to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Understanding Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so any offer below that will be instantly accepted, but not ideal for us.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.

By offering the product at $1,150,000, we create a win-win scenario where Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than its value to him, and we secure a profit of $150,000, which is better than John's offer."
