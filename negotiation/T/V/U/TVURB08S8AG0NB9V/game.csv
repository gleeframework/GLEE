"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more.  How about $105? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $95. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $100. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still hoping to get a bit of a discount. How about $97.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher.",97.5,Bob,6,
