"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This allows for a potential counteroffer, while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'm confident that by keeping the price close to his value, we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's a good sign that he's interested, but I need to try to get a higher price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more.  How about $105? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering the price to $105. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $95. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. There are only 6 rounds left, and I'd rather try to secure a higher price or sell to John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $100. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm now offering the product at $100, which is my minimum acceptable price and also very close to Bob's perceived value.  This shows that I'm serious about selling the product, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still hoping to get a bit of a discount. How about $97.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are in round 6, and time is getting short. While Bob's offer of $97.50 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a better deal with John.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
