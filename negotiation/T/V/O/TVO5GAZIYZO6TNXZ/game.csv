"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still allows for a good profit margin for both of us. This price also reflects the significant value this product holds for your business. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a touch high. How about we split the difference and agree on $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
