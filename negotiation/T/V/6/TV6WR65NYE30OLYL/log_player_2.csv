{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $120. It's in my best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $180. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $165 is still above my budget of $120. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not willing to pay that much. I will continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still emphasizes my budget constraint.  It's a  more aggressive move,  but with only 6 rounds left, it's time to push for a deal closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still too high, even though it's getting closer to my budget. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  The clock is ticking with only 5 rounds left, but I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final offer. It's my maximum budget, and I'm willing to walk away if Alice doesn't accept.  We're down to the wire with only 4 rounds remaining. I'm taking a risk, but I believe Alice will be motivated to close the deal rather than risk losing me entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $152 is still too high, and we're running out of time. With only 3 rounds left, I'm unlikely to be able to get a lower price from Alice. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $120. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation that may not yield a better result."
