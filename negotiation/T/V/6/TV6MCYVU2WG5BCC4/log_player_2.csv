Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,250 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,875? This price is very close to my minimum, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $11,875 is close, but I need to stick to my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $11,625, but this is really my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer, and the price of $11,625 is a reasonable discount from her initial offer.  Continuing to negotiate has a high risk of failing, leaving you to buy from John at the full $12,000."
