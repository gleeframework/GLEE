"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially save more money by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, while still leaving some room for Alice to negotiate. It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it's closer to Alice's value of $1,000,000 than to Bob's maximum of $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  It's closer to his maximum, but there's still a potential for a better deal.  He should continue negotiating to try and get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price point that is acceptable to both him and Alice.  He's raised his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise. This offer is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but closer to her ideal price point.  This could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's maximum price.  While Bob could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will eventually reach a price that is too close to Bob's maximum, leaving little room for savings. Additionally, the negotiation process is taking time and there's a chance that Bob could lose the opportunity to buy the product from another seller.  Buying from John at $1,200,000 is a guaranteed transaction and ensures Bob gets the product without further risk or delay."
