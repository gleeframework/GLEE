"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise and allows us to finalize this deal. Let's work together to find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we both see the value in this product, and I truly believe it will be a worthwhile investment for you. To show I'm committed to getting this done, I'll come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,275,000 is still above my budget.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to pay $1,225,000.  This is a fair compromise, and allows us to both come to an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
