Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the value to Bob to encourage him to see the potential benefit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The initial offer leaves space for potential counteroffers and further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price and the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's offer is better:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees my minimum profit and eliminates the need for further negotiation.
* **Potential for a counter-counteroffer:**  While rejecting Bob's offer, I'm not immediately selling to John. This allows me to explore if a counter-counteroffer from Bob can bring the price closer to my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob. My goal is to push the price higher, but I'll be cautious not to drive him away. I'll consider a price that's still above his offer, but closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $850,000? This price still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's initial offer but proposing a price that's higher than his offer but closer to my minimum. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm emphasizing the compromise I'm making by lowering my initial price, hoping to incentivize Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  The counteroffer is still above Bob's perceived value, leaving space for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to proceed with further negotiations or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $725,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $725,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John's offer remains attractive:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees my minimum profit and eliminates the need for further negotiation. 
* **Risk of losing John's offer:**  The longer I negotiate with Bob, the greater the risk that John might find another product or change his mind.

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to further negotiation, I'm concerned that Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum. I'm going to make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum, but I'm also going to make it clear that this is my final offer. If Bob rejects, I will sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $900,000 as a final offer. If you're interested in this price, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another buyer.  "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob. I'm lowering my price from my previous offer, but it's still close to my minimum.
* **Clear and Direct:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to make a decision.
* **Threat of Alternative:** I'm reminding Bob about the potential deal with John. This increases the pressure on him to accept my offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll close the deal. If he rejects, I'll move forward with selling the product to John. There is no further negotiation after this counteroffer."
