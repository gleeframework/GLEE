"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $850,000? This price still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $725,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $900,000 as a final offer. If you're interested in this price, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another buyer.  ",900000.0,Alice,5,
