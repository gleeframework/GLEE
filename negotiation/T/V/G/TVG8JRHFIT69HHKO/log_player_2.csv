"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's very fair, considering its value to you.  I'm sure you'll agree that it's a great deal. Let's talk about $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $12,000 is less than $15,000. 
* **You still save money:** You are willing to pay up to $15,000, so getting it for $12,000 is a good deal."
