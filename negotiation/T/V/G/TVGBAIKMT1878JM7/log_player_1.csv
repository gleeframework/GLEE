Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in this product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to consider $1000000?  I'm confident this product is valuable, and I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000, but higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000), I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1100000.  Let's split the difference. How about $1050000?  That's a fair price that I'm confident we can both agree on.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000), but lower than my last offer of $1,100,000, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

However, I also notice that Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure if I want to continue negotiating further. Considering the risk of losing the sale, I'll also consider selling the product to John for $1,000,000.
