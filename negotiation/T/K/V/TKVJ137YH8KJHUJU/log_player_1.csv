"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but not so high that it immediately turns Bob off.  I'm hoping this will allow for some negotiation and potentially get a good price while also leaving room for concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product at a higher price than he's currently offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $130. While it's still a bit lower than I'd like, it's a reasonable price and I'm getting closer to my desired range. We're now in round 4, and I want to avoid risking a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John for less."
