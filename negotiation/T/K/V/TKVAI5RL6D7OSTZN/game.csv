"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $13750. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider this offer?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $13250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13250.0,Alice,5,
