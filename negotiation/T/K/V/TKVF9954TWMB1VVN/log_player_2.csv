Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100, which is the market value you mentioned earlier. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no guarantee of getting a better deal from Alice at this point, and further haggling might lead to missing out on the product."
