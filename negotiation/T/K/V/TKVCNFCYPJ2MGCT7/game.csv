"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can we meet in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $22,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a significant discount and a fair offer considering the quality and potential return on investment.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the discount, but $19,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $16,000. Can we discuss further?",16000.0,Bob,4,
