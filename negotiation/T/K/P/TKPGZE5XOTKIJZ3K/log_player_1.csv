"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit.  I'm confident that Bob will be motivated to negotiate since the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer but still leaves me with a profit. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $16,500 is a good price for me, and it seems like we're getting close to a deal. It's better than selling to John, and I don't want to risk the deal falling apart completely."
