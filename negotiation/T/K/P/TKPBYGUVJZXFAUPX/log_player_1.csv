Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,999 is just below your guaranteed selling price. This creates the impression of a deal for Bob while maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is phrased to invite Bob's thoughts, leaving room for potential counter-offers if he's interested but finds the price a little too high."
