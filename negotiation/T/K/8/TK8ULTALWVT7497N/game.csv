"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your experience. I believe it's worth more than what you're currently paying for similar items. Let's make this valuable asset yours today. Would you like to purchase it for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $80 right now. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your interest in the product, Bob. Thank you for your counteroffer. Considering the value and uniqueness of the item, I would like to propose an offer of $95 for the product. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle and makes the deal beneficial for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking with my original offer of $80.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your persistence and understanding. After careful consideration, I am willing to lower the price to $90 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you and allows us to finalize the transaction.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm very close to my budget, but  $90 is still a little too high. I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $80.  Let me know if you're willing to take it. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. This is my final offer considering the value of the product. I hope you find this acceptable and we can proceed with the transaction.",85.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you getting closer to my price.  I'm going to have to stick with $80.  It's my absolute limit, but if you can accept that, we can finalize this deal. Let me know if you're willing to go for it.",80.0,Bob,8,
