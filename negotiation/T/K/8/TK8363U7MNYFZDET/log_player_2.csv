Alice is moving closer to our desired price range, but we can still try to get a better deal. There's a decent gap between her offer and our last counteroffer."

Round 7

While we could try to haggle further, Alice is consistently meeting in the middle and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a significantly better price in the remaining rounds."
