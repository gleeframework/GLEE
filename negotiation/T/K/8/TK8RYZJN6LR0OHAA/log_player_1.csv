{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a reasonable price that is still beneficial to me.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $14,000. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $13,250 is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it.  It's a good compromise and I'd rather secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
