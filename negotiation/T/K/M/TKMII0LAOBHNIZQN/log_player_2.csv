Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider your offer. However, due to the high demand for this product, I must maintain a minimum price. Therefore, I am proposing a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. This price still allows for a reasonable profit margin while reflecting the product's value to you. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations, and we can move forward with the transaction.
