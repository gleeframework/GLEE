"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product for me. However, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further at this price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider your offer. However, due to the high demand for this product, I must maintain a minimum price. Therefore, I am proposing a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. This price still allows for a reasonable profit margin while reflecting the product's value to you. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations, and we can move forward with the transaction.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $900,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows for a smooth transaction.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
