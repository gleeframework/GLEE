"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. Based on its potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's inherent worth and the significant benefit it can bring to your operations. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which still leaves room for you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still allows me to make a substantial profit. This price is a significant step towards your offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still out of my budget. I believe a fair price for both of us is $950,000.  This offer recognizes the value of the product while also respecting my financial limitations. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price acknowledges the value you place on the product while ensuring I can achieve my desired outcome.  Let's finalize this agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
