"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the value I'm seeking.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit and is fair to both of us. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1,250,000. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  $1,250,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000 as a final compromise.  If you aren't willing to meet me halfway on this, I'm going to have to consider selling to John instead. ",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000. Can you consider this price?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm finding it difficult to justify going any lower than $1,300,000. This price still represents a significant profit for you, and we're getting closer to a deal. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm going to have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
