While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of Bob rejecting further offers and ultimately leading to a sale to John for $1,000,000 is too high. This offer is still within a reasonable range, considering Bob's valuation and the diminishing rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and secures the sale."
