{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

As Bob, my goal is to save money. Since the product is worth $12,000 to me, and Alice is offering it at that price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still not ideal. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price. There's still room for a lower offer from Alice, and I have more rounds to try."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and we're getting close to my desired price point.  At this point, it's a better deal than buying from John.  While I could try for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might walk away, or I might run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
