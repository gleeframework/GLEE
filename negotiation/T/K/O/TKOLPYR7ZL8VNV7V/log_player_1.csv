"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. It's worth a significant amount to the right buyer. To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point given its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** By starting near Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), we're aiming to anchor the negotiation in a range that's favorable to us while still seeming reasonable to him.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:** The $50,000 difference between our offer and Bob's value provides space for concessions in later rounds.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential gain from the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  We have ample room to counter and work towards a price closer to our initial offer. Accepting now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. Additionally, selling to John for our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) would be premature at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,130,000? This price reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1130000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (But Not Too Much):** We are moving closer to Bob's offer to signal our willingness to negotiate, but not conceding too much too soon. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the counteroffer, even if general, keeps the negotiation grounded and prevents the back-and-forth from seeming arbitrary. 
* **Reiterating Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces our position that the price is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $1,105,000. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,105,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,105,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price point, but we still have room to negotiate. While $1,105,000 is a significant amount, accepting now would mean losing out on potential profit. We are willing to continue the negotiation to strive for a better outcome. We are not yet at a point where selling to John for $1,000,000 is the better alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm proposing $1,120,000.  This reflects the significant value this product holds and represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Concessions:** We are making smaller concessions now to signal we are reaching a point where large jumps are less likely. This can nudge Bob to be more aggressive in his counteroffers.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** By framing the price as a ""fair deal for both of us,"" we reiterate that we are seeking a win-win solution and not trying to take advantage of him. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** We are still significantly above John's offer, allowing us to maintain a strong position in the negotiation. We are not desperate to close the deal at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not going to go above $1,115,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,115,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position, But Risks:** While we're in a strong position, Bob has now presented what he claims is his ""final offer."" Continuing could lead to him walking away.

* **Profitable Deal:** Accepting $1,115,000 yields a profit of $115,000 above our minimum.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome.

* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation has diminishing returns. Accepting now allows us to move on and potentially pursue other deals.

This decision balances maximizing profit with the inherent risk of negotiation."
