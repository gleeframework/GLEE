"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $850,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm committed to purchasing this product, but I can only afford $825,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm still not able to go above $800,000. That's my absolute limit. This product is valuable to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,6,
