"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This is my final offer before I explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're serious about this deal, but I'm not willing to give up more profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is my last offer before I consider other options",920000.0,Alice,5,
