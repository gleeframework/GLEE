"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That way, we both get a fair deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget.

If you're willing to meet me at $105, I'll give you the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
