{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly. I'm also prepared to sell to John for $120, so I know my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I want to let you know that I'm also considering buying from a competitor who's willing to sell it to me for $100. If you're willing to meet me at $105, I'll give you the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the threat of going to a competitor. It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that meets my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that I can get $120 from John, so I'll sell to him instead."
