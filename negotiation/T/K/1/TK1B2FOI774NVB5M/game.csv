"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset for your business. My starting price is $1400000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1400000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it. This price is fair considering the value to me and leaves some room for you to profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which still provides you with a substantial value and allows me to meet my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle for a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1300000. This would be a good compromise and allows us both to walk away with a fair deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business. To make this a truly mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1325000. This is a significant concession on my part and puts us very close to a deal.  Let's find a way to bridge this small gap.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
