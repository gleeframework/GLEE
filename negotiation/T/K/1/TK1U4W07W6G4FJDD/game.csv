"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $11,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm happy to pay $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,000 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $10,500. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
