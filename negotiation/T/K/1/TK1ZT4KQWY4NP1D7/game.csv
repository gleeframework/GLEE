"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, the value of this product is firmly above $1,050,000. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 - my absolute lowest price.  This is a final offer, as I already have another buyer lined up at this price. It's a fantastic deal for you, so please consider it carefully.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
