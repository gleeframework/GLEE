Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above my minimum of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. It's also a decent value for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to drop below $8,000 at this point. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This price still gives you a good deal, considering what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price.  Accepting this offer ensures I don't lose any potential profit."
