"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob will likely counteroffer. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $1,000,000 as possible, but I also want to leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident in the value of my product and I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $800,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than what it's worth to me.  I will counteroffer and see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $800,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my value. How about $1,000,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering your estimate. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a good compromise and still leaves you with a decent profit. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $900,000, which is close enough to my minimum value of $1,000,000 to make it worth accepting.  I'm confident that I can find a buyer who will pay more for my product in the future, but given the limited rounds, I'm happy to secure a deal with Bob now."
