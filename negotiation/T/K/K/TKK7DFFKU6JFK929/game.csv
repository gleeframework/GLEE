"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $115 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's make this deal happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  If we can agree on that, let's make this deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $108, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $109?  It's a small increase from your last offer and gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",109.0,Alice,5,
