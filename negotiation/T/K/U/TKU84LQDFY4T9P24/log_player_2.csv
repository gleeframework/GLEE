"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget of $10,000. It makes sense to reject and counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $17,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate further. You may be able to get closer to your target price of $10,000."
