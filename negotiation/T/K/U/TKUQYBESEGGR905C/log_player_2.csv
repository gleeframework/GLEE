"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120.
* Alice is offering $100.
* There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $90?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120.
* Alice is now offering $95. 
* This is a good price, and you're likely to save more by accepting than trying to negotiate further.  There's a chance she'll reject your next counteroffer, and you'll end up buying from John at a higher price."
