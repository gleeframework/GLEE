"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is within his budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value of $800,000.  This is a significant drop from the initial offer of $950,000, but it's still above Alice's minimum. This gives Alice some room to negotiate but also shows Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $920,000 is a better price than the initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  He knows that Alice's minimum is $800,000, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob more leverage to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now increasing his counteroffer to $880,000. This is a significant increase from his previous offer of $850,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within his desired price range. This move aims to incentivize Alice to accept the offer and close the deal, as it's closer to her desired price of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily working down the price.  While he could continue to try and negotiate, the current offer of $900,000 is a good deal considering his budget of $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal, and the potential savings may not be worth the risk.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's still within his budget and saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John."
