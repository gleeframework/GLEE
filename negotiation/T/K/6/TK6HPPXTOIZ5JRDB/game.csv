"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850,000.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to get this amazing product, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my reach. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to meet you at $900,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,6,
