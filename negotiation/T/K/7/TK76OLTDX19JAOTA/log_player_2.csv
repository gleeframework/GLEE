Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to make this work on a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your hard limit is $800,000, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is as close as I can get to your limit while still making a decent profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and getting the product for $850,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000 price."
