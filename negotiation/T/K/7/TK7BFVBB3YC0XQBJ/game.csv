"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50?  This would still be a great deal for you!",117.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $110 just doesn't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",115.0,Alice,5,
