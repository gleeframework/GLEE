Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

I'm lowering my price from $1,800,000 to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum."

I've reached a point where negotiations with Bob aren't progressing quickly enough.  He's still significantly below my desired price range, and I'm concerned that the negotiations will continue to drag on.  

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While it's not my ideal price, it guarantees a sale and meets my minimum value requirement."
