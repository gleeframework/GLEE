"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm sure you'll find very interesting. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. Would you like to make an offer or accept my price?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to offer $1200000 for it.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $1350000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
