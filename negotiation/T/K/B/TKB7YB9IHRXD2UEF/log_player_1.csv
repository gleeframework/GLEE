{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob makes it more appealing.
* **Open-ended question:**  Encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Important Note:**  I am aware that I could simply sell to John for $15,000. However, I'm trying to maximize my profit and see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob's offer is a decent starting point for a counteroffer, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing negotiations.
* **Selling to John is an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the backup option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price. This gives me leverage. 

**Next Steps:** I will proceed to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Continuing to emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce my position.
* **Offering a fair deal:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  That's a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Negotiation leverage:** My ability to walk away and sell to John gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired $15,000, but still showing willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Leverage:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise, but also highlights that I'm not willing to go too low. 
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open Ended Question:**  The open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Note:**  I'm still aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I have the leverage to walk away if Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer."
