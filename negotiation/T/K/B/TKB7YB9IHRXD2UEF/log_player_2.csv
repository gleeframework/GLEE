# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her initial asking price, you can likely get it for less.  The next round gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still higher than your desired price.  You should reject her offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $10,250 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still not worth it.  You can get the same product from John for $8,000, which is a much better deal."
