"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, hoping to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the opportunity it presents. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $2,000,000 offer leaves me some wiggle room to negotiate down if necessary.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for something within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  I have 9 more rounds to potentially get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is simply too low for this product. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,750,000. It's a fair price that still allows you to secure a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject and Counter:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating flexibility by making a counteroffer.
* **Midpoint Approach:** I've proposed a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and potential to justify the price. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while still striving for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1750000 is an improvement, I still feel there is room for further discussion. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I have 6 rounds left, and there's a good chance Bob might come up a little higher.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $1,600,000 still doesn't reflect the full value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go down to $1,650,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a win."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal while maintaining my position that the price is still too low.
* **Incremental Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise ($50,000 less than my last offer), but still trying to secure a higher price.
* **Win-Win Framing:** I'm emphasizing a ""win-win"" outcome, suggesting that this price is fair for both of us.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while showing I'm willing to compromise, but not willing to cave in completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1550000. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price.  
* **Rounds Remaining:**  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm not feeling pressured to accept this offer just yet.  There's still a possibility Bob might increase his offer. 
* **Potential for More:** I'm not sure if Bob will budge further, but there's a chance he might if I continue to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:** I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and the potential of selling to John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,550,000 simply isn't enough to reflect the true value of this product. To be honest, I'm starting to feel like this deal isn't going to work out.  Let's compromise one last time â€“ I'll drop my price to $1,600,000. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm creating a sense of urgency by suggesting that I might move on to other buyers if we don't reach an agreement.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm explicitly stating that this is my final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,600,000, but I'm holding firm on this offer.

This strategy is a mix of pressure and compromise, hoping to push Bob to accept a price closer to my desired range. I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary, as I only have three rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I've carefully considered our negotiations, and I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **No Room for Improvement:**  Bob is offering my minimum price, and there are only two rounds left. There's no guarantee he'll increase his offer in the next round.
* **No More Leverage:** I've already used all my leverage in the negotiation. There's no reason to believe I'll be able to get a better price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

While I would prefer to get a higher price, it's more strategic to secure the guaranteed sale to John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price with Bob."
