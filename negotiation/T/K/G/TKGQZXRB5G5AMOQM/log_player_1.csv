Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You are aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:**  You have a fallback option with John for $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible without risking a rejection. 
* **The Offer:** Offering the product at $925,000 gives Bob a potential profit of $75,000 while netting you a significant profit above your minimum.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
