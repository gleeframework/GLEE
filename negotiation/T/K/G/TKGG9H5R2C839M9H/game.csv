"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000  is significantly below its true value and potential for generating revenue. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other buyers willing to meet my valuation.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I still think $1,050,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and potential for revenue. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above this price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
