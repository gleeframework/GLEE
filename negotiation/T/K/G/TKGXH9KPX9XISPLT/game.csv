"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value for me.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think I can do better. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
