You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and John is also selling for $1,500,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  You can get the product from John at the same price."
