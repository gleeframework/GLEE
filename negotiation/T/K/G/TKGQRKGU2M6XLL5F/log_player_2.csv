"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer ($11,000 vs. $14,000), we create room for negotiation and signal that we're looking for a better deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $11,000 is still a reasonable profit margin for Alice ($1,000 over her valuation) while putting us in a strong position to potentially meet in the middle later in the negotiation. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** We haven't forgotten about John's offer of $15,000, which acts as our upper limit. We want to secure a price significantly better than that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your position, $11,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. Could you do $13,000? That would make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice lowering her price to $13,000 shows she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's still a gap between her offer and our ideal price. A counteroffer around $12,000 could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John as Backup:**  We're still below John's offer, so there's no immediate need to accept Alice's price. We maintain leverage."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($13,000) and our previous offer ($12,000), signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** By phrasing it as a ""fair compromise,"" we subtly nudge Alice towards a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $12,500 is a strong offer. It's significantly lower than John's price ($15,000) and a good deal for us if accepted.  It also leaves a little room for Alice to counter if she's absolutely unwilling to go that low."
