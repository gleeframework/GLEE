"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,350,000 is the maximum I can go. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer - let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I can see you're really serious about this deal.  However, $1,400,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,425,000 as a final compromise.  This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize this.",1425000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable going above $1,400,000. I've reached my budget limit, and I really need to be careful with my expenses. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
