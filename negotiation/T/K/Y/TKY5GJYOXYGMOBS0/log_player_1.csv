"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strong Opening:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Leave room for Negotiation:** This price allows for 10 rounds of negotiation while still maximizing my potential earnings. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure the highest possible price, but I'm also aware of the time limit and John's offer. I will assess Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly, being prepared to make counteroffers or accept a lower price if necessary to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Selling to John is a better option:** I have the opportunity to secure a higher price by selling to John, making his offer more attractive at this stage.
* **Negotiation potential:** I am willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to start the next round with a higher counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, aiming to find a price closer to my initial asking price. However, I will keep John's offer in mind and might choose to sell to him if the negotiations with Bob stall or if I feel his offer is unlikely to improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price and make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price still leaves room for further negotiation, giving Bob the opportunity to meet me halfway.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to create a scenario where Bob feels pressured to accept a higher price by showing my willingness to negotiate while also emphasizing the value of the product. I'm confident that I can close the deal at this price or, if necessary, continue negotiating in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,350,000 is the maximum I can go. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to justify selling the product.  
* **John's offer is the safer option:**  I'm guaranteed to earn $1,500,000 by selling to John, and there's a risk that Bob's offer won't improve further. 
* **Negotiation risks:** We are already halfway through the rounds, and there's limited time to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, but I am keeping John's offer as a safety net. I am prepared to accept a slightly lower price from Bob if necessary, but I won't settle for anything less than $1,450,000. If I don't see a significant improvement in Bob's offer in the next round, I will sell to John to ensure I achieve my minimum target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer - let me know if you're ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm setting a clear deadline for Bob, emphasizing this is my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and pressure to accept.
* **Compromise but Not Too Low:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price and increase the likelihood of him accepting.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping to secure a deal at this price, but I'm aware of John's offer and might be willing to accept a slightly lower price if Bob agrees to this final offer. If Bob rejects, I will likely go with John's offer in the next round to minimize risk and ensure a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the possibility of doing business with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,450,000. 
* **John's offer is a safer bet:** With only a few rounds remaining,  the risk of further negotiation with Bob is high. John's offer provides a guaranteed higher return. 
* **Negotiation time is running out:**  We're now in the 6th round, and the remaining time might not be sufficient to push Bob to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'm still hopeful I can get a higher price from Bob. But, with the remaining rounds limited and John's offer on the table, I'm choosing to play it safe. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price, but I am prepared to sell to John in the next round if Bob rejects my final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I can see you're really serious about this deal.  However, $1,400,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,425,000 as a final compromise.  This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm making a final concession, hoping to close the deal with a price that's just slightly higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product again, making it clear that this price is still very favorable for Bob.
* **Urgency:**  I'm reiterating that this is a final compromise, putting pressure on Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a deal as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible. This offer is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, making it potentially attractive to him.  However, I'm prepared to accept John's offer if Bob rejects this final counteroffer. With only three rounds remaining, I need to make a decisive move to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable going above $1,400,000. I've reached my budget limit, and I really need to be careful with my expenses. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time and no significant progress:** We are down to the last two rounds, and there has been no significant improvement in Bob's offers. 
* **Risk of no deal:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in no deal at all, as he has clearly stated his budget limit.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a higher profit of $1,500,000, which meets my minimum target.

**Strategy:**

I'm prioritizing a guaranteed profit over the possibility of a slightly higher price from Bob. With the time constraint and Bob's firm stance, I'm choosing the secure option of selling to John."
