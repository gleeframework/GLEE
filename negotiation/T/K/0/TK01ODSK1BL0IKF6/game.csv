"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it allows you to stay within your budget.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $10,250 as a counteroffer. This is closer to my budget while still allowing you to receive a fair price for your product.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. While $10,250 is a better offer, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about $10,400? This gives us both a fair price, and keeps the deal moving forward. Let me know what you think.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I would like to counter with $10,350. This brings us closer to my budget while still providing you with a reasonable profit. I hope this helps move the deal forward.",10350.0,Bob,6,
