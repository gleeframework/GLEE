"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'll sell it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $850,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $920,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $920,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering its value and our previous offers.  Let's try to reach an agreement here.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, $880,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $915,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $915,000 is getting closer, I'm still not there yet. I'm prepared to offer $895,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best offer we can both agree on. What do you say?",895000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, $895,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $910,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",910000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $910,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, and this is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.  I believe this is a fair price considering all our negotiations.",900000.0,Bob,10,
