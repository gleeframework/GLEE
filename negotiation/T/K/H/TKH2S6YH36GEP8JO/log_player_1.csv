Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value at $15,000, given its unique features and benefits. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting with a higher price ($15,000) allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Justification:**  While Bob values the product at $12,000, mentioning ""unique features and benefits"" might encourage him to consider a price slightly higher if he sees the value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests willingness to discuss, which is crucial in negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide to go lower, closer to your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might want to start slightly lower. However, starting too low can undervalue the product.
* **Market Information:**  Is $12,000 the absolute market value, or could the product be worth even more to the right buyer? If you have time, researching the market further could be beneficial."
