"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  This product is a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will generate a strong return for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the potential of this product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
