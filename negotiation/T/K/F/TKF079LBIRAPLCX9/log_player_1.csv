{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to two rounds left, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John's offer is secure:** John is willing to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing I won't lose money.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a chance that Bob will reject my counteroffer in the next round, leaving me with only one final round to potentially get a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing risk:** By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit. Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of not reaching a deal and potentially losing out on a sale. 
* **Focusing on certainty:** With limited time and a guaranteed offer from John, it's more prudent to accept the safe option and secure a sale."
