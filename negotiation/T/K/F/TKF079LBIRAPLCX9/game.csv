"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $140.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  $140 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $145? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this deal happen!",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price.  How about $142? This is my final offer. Let's make this happen.",142.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're at your limit, but $142 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $144.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a small profit.  Let's finalize this deal!",144.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really trying to stay within my budget. $144 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $143?  This is my absolute final offer.",143.0,Bob,8,
