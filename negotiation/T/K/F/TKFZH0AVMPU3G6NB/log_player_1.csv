This offer starts at a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
