"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm getting a fair price for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,750? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. ",10750.0,Alice,5,
