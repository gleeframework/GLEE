"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $200 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $140 is closer, I'm afraid my budget just can't stretch that far.  Would you consider $95? That's the absolute highest I can go.",95.0,Bob,4,
