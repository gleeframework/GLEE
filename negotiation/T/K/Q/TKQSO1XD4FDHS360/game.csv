"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a more comfortable price for me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to sell for $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
