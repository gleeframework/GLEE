"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,500,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to $800,000? I believe this might align better with both our interests.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding the inherent value of this product. While $800,000 is a significant offer, I'm confident it's worth considerably more. To find a middle ground, how about we settle on $1,200,000? This acknowledges your interest while reflecting the product's true potential.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. While $1,200,000 is a substantial amount, I still believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering my financial situation and the product's potential, would it be possible to negotiate down to $1,050,000? I think this could be a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
