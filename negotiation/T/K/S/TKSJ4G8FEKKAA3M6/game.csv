"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1500000. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth and potential.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low. It's important to recognize the unique value this product holds. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1350000. This still leaves room for you to profit significantly, while acknowledging the product's true worth. Consider this my final offer before I explore other opportunities.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
