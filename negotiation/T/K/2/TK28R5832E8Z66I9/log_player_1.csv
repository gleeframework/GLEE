Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $500,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer, giving you leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that $500,000 surplus as possible without alienating Bob completely. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" frame the negotiation positively.
* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant portion of the surplus value. 
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the ""return on investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get $350,000 more than John's offer.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly and still come out ahead.
* **Bob Rejects:** You accept John's offer, securing your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round offer. In a real-world negotiation, there would likely be multiple rounds of offers and counteroffers."
