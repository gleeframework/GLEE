"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $850,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value this product has, $850,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it,  a price that I believe is fair given my own valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $825,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. This price is within my budget, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us.  What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,
