"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit your business greatly.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential benefits for Bob, aiming to create a positive negotiation environment.
* **Open to Discussion:** The phrasing ""start the conversation"" and ""what are your thoughts"" invites Bob to engage actively in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness to pay:** His response will indicate how much he values the product and how flexible he might be.
2. **Establish a strong initial position:**  Even if this offer is rejected, it sets a high anchor point for subsequent negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. After evaluating its potential value to my business, I am willing to offer $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still below my starting point and significantly under my ideal selling price. I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to accept a price below my minimum yet, nor do I want to settle for John's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's clear you recognize the value of this product. However, my initial assessment of its worth to your specific business model was considerably higher.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,950,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:**  I've lowered my price by $50,000, demonstrating movement and a willingness to compromise. However, I've coupled it with a justification that subtly reaffirms the product's high value specifically for Bob's business. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer remains significantly above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer, keeping the negotiation momentum going.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  The phrasing ""middle ground"" and ""fair deal for both of us"" emphasizes a collaborative approach rather than an adversarial one. 

I believe this approach keeps the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. Considering the value I believe the product can bring to my business, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is strong and significantly exceeds both my minimum price ($1,500,000) and his initial perceived value ($1,200,000). While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob could walk away or become less willing to negotiate.  

Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the potential for a stalemate or losing the deal altogether. It represents a successful negotiation outcome."
