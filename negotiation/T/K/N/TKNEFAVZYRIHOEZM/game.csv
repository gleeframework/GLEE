"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  I believe it has the potential to significantly benefit your business.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2,000,000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price point reflects the unique value proposition this product offers.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm comfortable offering $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,400,000. This price reflects my strong desire to work with you while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. I believe this offer represents a significant value for a product of this caliber.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. Given my budget constraints, I'm offering $1,200,000. This represents a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
