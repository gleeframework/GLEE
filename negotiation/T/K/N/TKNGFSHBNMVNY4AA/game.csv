"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $950,000.  Do you think that's doable?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I need to know if that's the best you can do. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. I can tell we're getting close.  How about $980,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm glad we're close to an agreement. However, $980,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,020,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
