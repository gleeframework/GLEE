{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $100. Could we possibly negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Would it be possible for us to settle at $105? This would allow me to stay within my budget while also providing you with a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price and allows me to avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely."
