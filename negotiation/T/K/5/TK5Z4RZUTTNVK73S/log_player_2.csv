"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Would you like to make an offer of $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might prompt her to come down in price."
