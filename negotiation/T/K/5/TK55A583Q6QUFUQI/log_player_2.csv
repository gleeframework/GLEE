"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand $100 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to come down a bit more to $110. That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get a fair price for the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $110
* **Bob's Value:** $150
* **Alice's Value:** $80

While Bob could try to negotiate further, $110 is a fair price. It's within Bob's budget and a decent profit for Alice.  There's a higher chance Alice will accept a counteroffer, but it's not worth the risk of her rejecting it and then having to buy from John at a higher price."
