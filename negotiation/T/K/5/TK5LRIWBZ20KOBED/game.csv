,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1500000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1000000.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
