"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a competitive price.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product and willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make this investment.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be very happy with the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of reach for me.  I'm happy to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $887,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",887500.0,Alice,5,
