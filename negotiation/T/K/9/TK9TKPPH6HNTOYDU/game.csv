"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  That would allow me to make this deal work for me while still providing you with a great deal on this valuable product. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a deal work, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,125 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",10125.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm trying to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $10,187.50?  This is only a slight increase from your offer, and it would bring us much closer to a deal. It's also a more rounded number that could make the decision easier for both of us.  What do you think?",10187.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll go up to $10,100. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product offers, and I'm willing to make a final concession. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",10100.0,Bob,8,
