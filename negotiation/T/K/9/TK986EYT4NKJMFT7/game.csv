"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $110 is still a bit higher than I can go. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? ",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $107.50 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference again and go with $108.75. It's just a small step closer to a deal.",108.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $108.75 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we go with $107.12? It's only a small difference, but it gets us closer to an agreement.",107.12,Bob,6,
