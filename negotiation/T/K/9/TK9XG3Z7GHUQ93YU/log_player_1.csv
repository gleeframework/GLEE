Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product is worth less than $18,000 to me. I would like to propose a price of $16,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $16,500. This price still allows me to save some money while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $16,500 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum, and it seems like Bob is firm on his price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less."
