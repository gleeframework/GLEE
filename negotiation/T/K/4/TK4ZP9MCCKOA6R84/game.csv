,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a lower price,  $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $112.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again?  I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and also allows you to get a great deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
