"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

The offer from Alice is too high. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting its value. While I do think it's a great product, $9,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $8,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still not the best deal. John is offering the product for $8,000, which is a better price than Alice's current offer. Therefore, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John."
