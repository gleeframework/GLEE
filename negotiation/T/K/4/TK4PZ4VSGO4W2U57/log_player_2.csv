{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a strong opening move to show Bob's serious intent to negotiate and push for a lower price. He's aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $1,000,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is determined to get the best deal possible. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows him to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows he's willing to compromise but is still aiming for a price closer to his ideal. He's trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Alice while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's ideal price point, and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to Alice becoming unwilling to sell or even increasing the price.  While Bob could continue to try to negotiate, accepting the offer at $1,090,000 is the most logical move at this point. It secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer and is within Bob's budget."
