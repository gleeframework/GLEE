"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at a price of $1,500,000.  This is a unique product with significant value, and I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always beneficial to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:**  While the initial price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, justifying it with the product's ""unique"" and ""valuable"" nature might make it seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price allows for potential counteroffers and compromises, making a deal more likely within the 10 rounds. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer of $1,200,000.  While there might be a slight chance of negotiating a higher price with Bob, it's risky. Accepting John's offer guarantees the maximum possible profit without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
