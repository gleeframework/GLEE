Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. Would you be willing to go up to $130?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think $115 is still a bit too low, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $125? That's as low as I can go 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice seems firm on not going below $125. It's a reasonable compromise, saving me $25 compared to John's offer."
