"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. Would you be willing to go up to $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I think $115 is still a bit too low, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $125? That's as low as I can go",125.0,Alice,5,
