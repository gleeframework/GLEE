**Strategy:**

* I want to start high to maximize my potential profit.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation while also setting a strong initial position.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to come closer to my desired price.
* At this point, it's getting riskier to continue negotiating with Bob. I've already lowered my price significantly, and further concessions could lead to a lower profit margin.
* Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a good profit and avoids the risk of continued negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed profit with John.
* While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of continuing negotiations outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal.
* This decision balances my desire for maximum profit with the need to make a timely and secure sale."
