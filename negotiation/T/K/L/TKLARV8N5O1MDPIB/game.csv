"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle this right now at $760,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as high as $760,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
