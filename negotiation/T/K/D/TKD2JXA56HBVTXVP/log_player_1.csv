Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. There's room to negotiate for a higher price, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still seeking a price closer to the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $85 is not ideal, it is still a higher price than selling to John.  Bob is clearly not willing to go higher, and further negotiation might lead to a lower price. Therefore, I will accept his offer and sell the product."
