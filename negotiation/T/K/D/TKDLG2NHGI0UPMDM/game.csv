"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price still provides you with significant value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,225,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
