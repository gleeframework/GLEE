{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:**  This is a starting point for negotiation. It's above Bob's perceived value but gives him room to counter-offer.
* **Message:**  I've kept the message brief and positive, emphasizing the ""deal"" aspect. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  I'm starting high, hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  Leaving room for Bob to counter-offer keeps the negotiation going.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  I can always accept John's offer if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is too low:** While Bob is willing to pay $15,000, his offer is significantly below my minimum. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. I can likely get a higher price than $12,000 by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have John as a backup. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $15,000 and his offer of $12,000. I want to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $16,000, which is a compromise between my initial price of $18,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the ""deal"" aspect to maintain a good rapport. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation.  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'm still determined to get a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** I'm trying to get a price closer to my desired price while acknowledging Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** This encourages further discussion and keeps the possibility of a mutually beneficial agreement open.
* **Remain flexible:** I'm ready to adjust my offer if necessary, but I'm not going to settle for a price significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $14000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate further to try to reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **John's offer is a good fallback:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can sell the product to John for $15,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired price while considering Bob's finality. I want to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $14,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. I'll accept $14,500 for the product, but this is my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're agreeable."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $14,500, which is halfway between Bob's offer of $14,000 and my previous offer of $16,000.
* **Final offer:** I'm stating this is my final offer to signal seriousness and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage acceptance.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** $14,500 is still a significant profit for me.
* **Encourage acceptance:**  The ""final offer"" message creates pressure for Bob to accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $14500. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Please consider this my final offer.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's final offer is below my minimum:** Bob's final offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's offer is a better option:**  I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000, which is a better deal for me than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Ending negotiations:**  There's little chance of getting a better price from Bob. It's time to cut my losses and accept the safer option. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll inform Bob that I've decided to sell the product to someone else, and then contact John to finalize the sale."
