"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $14000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on $14000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. I'll accept $14500 for the product, but this is my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're agreeable.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $14500. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Please consider this my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
