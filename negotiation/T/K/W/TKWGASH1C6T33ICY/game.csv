"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to achieve. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000?  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement without needing to go any further.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
