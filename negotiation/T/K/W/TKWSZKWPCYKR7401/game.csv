"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's capabilities warrant a higher investment.  I could consider coming down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still quite a ways apart. I appreciate you coming down, but I can't justify going above $1,000,000. If you're able to come down closer to that, I'm very interested, otherwise I might have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
