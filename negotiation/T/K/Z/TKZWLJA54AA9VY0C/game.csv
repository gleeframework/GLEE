"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $200 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. ",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $175 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $125. This is my final offer, let's see if we can close this deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have your budget, but $125 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $150 for the product. This is my final offer, let's make this deal happen. ",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125. It's a fair price for both of us, let's close the deal.",125.0,Bob,6,
