"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for your business."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down and ensures that Bob is incentivized to try and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and your potential profit. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to facilitate a deal. This still leaves a profit margin for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's closer than his previous offer, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a better deal with John. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,400,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential profit it offers you.  Let's close this deal now and avoid further delays."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to go a little higher, but $1,500,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and the potential profit you'll make. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Even though we are getting closer, I'm concerned that further negotiation may lead to more delays and ultimately a lower price. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with John, so I'll choose to sell the product to him for $1,500,000."
