"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $75. This is a good deal, but I can try to get it for even less. I'll reject her offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 

I'll start by offering $60. This is still a good deal for Alice since it's more than what it's worth to her, and it gives me some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $80 is still a good deal for me, as it's below my maximum price of $100. I'll accept her offer and avoid further negotiation."
