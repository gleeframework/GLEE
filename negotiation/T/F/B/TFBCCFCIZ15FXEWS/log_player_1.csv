"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's a significant discount:** Offering $12,000 is a 25% discount from your minimum price, which could be appealing to Bob.
* **It's not too low:** It's still above the product's value to Bob, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's friendly:** A positive message creates a good starting point for negotiations. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest while keeping your options open. If he rejects, you can either counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to your minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what you want. You have 8 rounds left and John is waiting to buy at your desired price. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your goal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's still a great price for a product of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  You're willing to negotiate, but not at a massive loss.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You're still above Bob's offer, giving you room to move in the next round.
* **Remains positive:** It keeps the communication open and friendly.

This strategy allows you to keep moving the price up while staying in control of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your goal, it's still below your desired price. You have 6 rounds left and John is a guaranteed sale at your minimum. It's worth pushing for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows continued flexibility:**  You're still willing to compromise, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Offers a small concession:** You're only increasing your offer by $250, indicating you're getting close to your limit.
* **Expresses urgency:** The ""let's close this deal"" message adds a sense of finality, potentially encouraging Bob to accept. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining your leverage. It's likely that Bob will either accept or counter with an offer closer to your desired price."
