"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I've made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to make one last, final, and firm offer: $1200000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. This is my absolute final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
