Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, it's best to start high and see if he's willing to bite.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  Remember, I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can do better. He has shown he's willing to pay over my minimum, so I'll see if I can push him higher. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than the $2 million I initially asked for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,850,000.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, this deal still nets me a significant profit and is above my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether and being forced to sell to John for a lower price. It's time to close the deal and move on."
