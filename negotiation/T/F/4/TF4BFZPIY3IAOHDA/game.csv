,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,500? This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $11,000. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, how about $11,250?  This price is closer to your offer and hopefully we can close the deal. ",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
