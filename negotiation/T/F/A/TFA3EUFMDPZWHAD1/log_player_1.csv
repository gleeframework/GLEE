Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high.  Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique"" nature, you add perceived value, making the higher price more palatable.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than your guaranteed $1,200,000."
