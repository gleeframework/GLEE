"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?  I believe that's a fair price that would benefit us both.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid $6,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
