"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to pay $12,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still hoping for a price closer to $13,000.  This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",13500.0,Alice,5,
