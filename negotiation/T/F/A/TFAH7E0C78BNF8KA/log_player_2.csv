"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $90. While this is a good deal, you can get it for $100 from John, which is still within your budget. Since you want to save as much money as possible, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
