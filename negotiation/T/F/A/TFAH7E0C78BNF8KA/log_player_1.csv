Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer of $80 from John.

By offering the product to Bob at $90, you are:

1. **Maximizing Profit:**  You are aiming for the highest possible price Bob might accept, maximizing your potential profit.
2. **Staying Above Your Minimum:** You are ensuring you receive more than John's offer.
3. **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob could counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially earn even more. 

This strategy balances risk and reward to achieve the best possible outcome for you."
