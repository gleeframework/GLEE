"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get a good price. If Bob rejects, I'll have to be more flexible, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's less than half of what I value the product at. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still holding out for a decent amount.  $12,000 is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,500 is still too low. I'm not getting any closer to my minimum of $15,000, and I'm running out of time. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit more, but I'm still holding firm. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a good deal for him and that we're getting closer to a compromise. If he rejects this, I'm seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I need to be realistic. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. While I'd love to get more, I can't risk losing out entirely.  Selling to John guarantees me a decent profit and avoids further haggling."
