"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $9,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,
