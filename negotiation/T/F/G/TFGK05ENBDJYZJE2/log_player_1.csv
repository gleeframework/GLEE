``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is still below my minimum:** While it's closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $10,000.
* **More rounds left:** I have more rounds to negotiate and potentially increase the offer.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If I can't get a better deal, I can still sell to John for $10,000. 

I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3

**Reasoning:**

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, after careful consideration, I am willing to pay $9170 for the product. I believe this is a fair price and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,170
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too close to the end:** With no more rounds to negotiate, I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob.
* **John's offer is better:**  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees a higher price than Bob's final offer.
* **Risk of losing everything:**  Rejecting Bob's offer risks ending the negotiation without a deal, leaving me with nothing. 

I'll take the guaranteed $10,000 from John, as it's the most profitable option in this situation."
