```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1300000. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'll give you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'll counteroffer at $1250000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's price,  the offer is still above his preferred price and there's no guarantee that they'll be able to agree on a price.  John's price is the best offer Bob has right now, and there's no need to risk further negotiation."
