Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (though unlikely given his valuation). 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Why not other prices?**

* **$120 or higher:**  Bob will definitely reject this, as it's more than his perceived value.
* **$100-$110:** This leaves potential profit on the table. Bob might accept immediately, and you'd miss out on getting a higher price."
