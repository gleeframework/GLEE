"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $850,000 from Alice.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice values the product at $800,000, offering $750,000 is a reasonable starting point.  This leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $775,000 is within your budget and significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal considering you value the product at $1,000,000.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better price in further negotiation, so accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
