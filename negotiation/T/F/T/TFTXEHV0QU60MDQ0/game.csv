"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is my best counteroffer at this time.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit away from that number.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'll meet you at $1,300,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
