Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $800,000. I understand that's a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $925,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and offer it to you for $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

This is a good deal.  Alice is very unlikely to go much lower and it's already significantly less than John's offer."
