"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at face value. You can try to negotiate a lower price, and if that fails, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a 10% discount seems reasonable. It's a significant enough reduction to signal your interest in negotiating, but not so low that it's immediately insulting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved slightly closer to your counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by continuing the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round, meeting her halfway. This shows I'm serious about getting a deal, while still pushing for a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is still coming down in price, and we're getting closer to a deal. There's no reason to accept this offer yet. Let's keep negotiating to see if we can get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly becoming more flexible in her pricing. I'm raising my counteroffer again, this time meeting her halfway.  We are getting closer to a mutually acceptable price, and this move shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is now offering a price that is only $20,000 more than my last offer. This is a very small difference, and accepting her offer is a good deal.  There's a good chance we won't be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds, and it's better to secure the product now than risk losing it to John or having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
