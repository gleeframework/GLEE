"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, at $110, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I know he values the product at $80, so there's some room for negotiation. This will also give me an idea of how serious Bob is about acquiring the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $75 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm not eager to sell to John for $100,  I'm willing to hold out and see if I can get a better deal from Bob.  There's still room for negotiation, and I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm countering with $95. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both be happy with the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $85. While it's still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's also higher than what John would pay.  It's important to be flexible in negotiations, and it's better to make a deal than to hold out for too long and risk losing both buyers."
