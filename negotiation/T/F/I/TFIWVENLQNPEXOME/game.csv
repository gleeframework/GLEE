"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $700,000. Would you consider this?",700000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,850000.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $760,000?  That's a reasonable compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $760,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $810,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",810000.0,Alice,5,,
