Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting with a significantly higher price than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value (""exceed your expectations"") without revealing your minimum price.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the product and price can influence Bob's perception of its value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:** This strategy assumes Alice has some knowledge of the market and potential buyers like Bob. If there's a chance others would pay even more than $1,200,000, she should adjust her offer accordingly.
* **Bob's Personality:** This offer assumes Bob is open to negotiation. If Alice knows Bob is very price-sensitive, she might start lower but still above $800,000.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk Bob might reject outright. However, Alice has a guaranteed backup offer from John at her minimum price.

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation where Alice can still achieve a price significantly higher than her minimum while ensuring a sale."
