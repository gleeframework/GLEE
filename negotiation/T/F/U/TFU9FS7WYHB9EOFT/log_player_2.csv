"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you $500,000:**  You'd pay $1,000,000 instead of $1,500,000 from John.
* **It's still a good deal for you:** You value the product at $1,500,000, and you're getting it for less."
