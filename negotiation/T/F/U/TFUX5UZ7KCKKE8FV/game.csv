"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but would like to start at $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This price reflects the true value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $11,500. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? That would be a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
