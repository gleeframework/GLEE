"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $13,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's valuation.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but would like to start at $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob wants to start low and leave room for negotiation. $10,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer and closer to her valuation, but still leaves room for compromise. 
* **Showing Interest:**  The message expresses interest in the product, but also clearly states Bob's desired price point. 
* **Setting the Stage:**  The message ends on a positive note, inviting further discussion and emphasizing finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There's room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to try and drive the price down closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $11,500. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob shows willingness to meet Alice halfway by suggesting a price in between their last offers.
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""fair"" price, appealing to Alice's sense of equity.
* **Target in Sight:**  $10,750 is closer to Bob's desired price but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
