"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a fantastic product at a price significantly lower than its value to you. I'm confident this is a win-win situation. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiating, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still leaves room for you to make a substantial profit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.
