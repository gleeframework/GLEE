Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and while my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to make this offer particularly attractive to you. Would you be interested in discussing a price around $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob at a slightly lower price can still yield a significant profit.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, allowing us to potentially meet in the middle while still exceeding our minimum.
* **Confidential Minimum:** We don't want to reveal our absolute bottom line ($1,200,000) to Bob.  This keeps our options open and maintains a stronger negotiating position. 

**Outcome:**

This offer creates a good balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
