"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his limit. He can get the product for less from John, and there's no need to risk further negotiation."
