"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the potential savings are small and the risk of losing the deal to John is higher."
