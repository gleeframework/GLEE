"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $160 to start.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $160 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for me. This product is high-quality, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  Could you do $75? That's a fair compromise, I think."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I can't accept $75, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go below $100, and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. You can get the product for a guaranteed $80 from John."
