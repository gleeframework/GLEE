"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is considerably higher, and $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, so I'm offering $14,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
