{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a bit below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it leaves some room for negotiation. By offering a reasonable price initially, I hope to entice Bob to accept the offer or at least counteroffer, giving me a chance to earn more.  If Bob rejects, I'll then decide whether to accept his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? I'm really interested in the product but my budget is limited. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  I'll try to meet him halfway, but I'll still aim for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110 to try and make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $110 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer. I'll try to meet him halfway once more. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $105.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
