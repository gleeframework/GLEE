"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? I'm really interested in the product but my budget is limited.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110 to try and make this work.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $110 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $105.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,5,
