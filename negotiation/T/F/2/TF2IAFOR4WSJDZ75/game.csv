"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in your product but my budget is much lower. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $17000, considering your interest in the product. Let's find a middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $16000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $14000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
