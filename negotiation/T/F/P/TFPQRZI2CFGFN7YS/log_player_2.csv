"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000 from Alice.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer, as she values the product at $8,000. You can save money by rejecting her initial offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $12,000. It's a fair starting point for negotiation, as it's still above Alice's value of $8,000.  By offering a lower price, you're showing your willingness to negotiate and are likely to start a productive back-and-forth with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  While you might be able to get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John at a much higher price.  $11,000 is a good price that allows you to save money and still get the product."
