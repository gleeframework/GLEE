I'm starting with a significantly lower offer of $8,000. This is a bold move, but it signals my seriousness about buying the product while still leaving room for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still too high. It's time to try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my maximum."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
