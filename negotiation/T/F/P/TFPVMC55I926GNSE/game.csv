"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to start at a price of $18,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product to me. Let's make a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.  Let's close this deal and avoid going any further.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out. I'll meet you at $14,000, but I need you to meet me halfway on the last offer. I'll give you a slight discount, and I'll sell the product to you for $13,750. This is my final offer.",13750.0,Alice,7,
