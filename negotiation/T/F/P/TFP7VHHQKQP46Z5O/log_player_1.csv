Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product has incredible potential and will bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet halfway? I can offer it to you for $1,125,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I still feel that $950,000 was too high. I've done some research and found that similar products are being sold for around $875,000. Would you consider $875,000 for this product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. While his offer is getting closer to his perceived value, it's still a long way from our minimum and we have room to negotiate. Moving to the next round keeps the possibility of a better deal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, but comparing this product to others at $875,000 is like comparing a thoroughbred to a donkey. This product offers unique advantages and value that others simply can't match. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, Bob."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are now applying pressure by: 

* **Highlighting the product's uniqueness:**  We're reinforcing why his comparisons are inaccurate.
* **Making a smaller concession:** Shows we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Declaring a ""final offer"":** Creates urgency and forces a decision. 

This strategy aims to either get Bob to finally meet closer to our price or make him realize that dragging this out further is pointless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence and the value of the product, but I still believe that $875,000 is a fair price considering the market trends and comparable products. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $875,000 and is unlikely to budge significantly.  He's using market comparisons that might not be entirely accurate for this specific product. At this point, continuing negotiations with Bob carries a higher risk of losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  Selling to John ensures we get our minimum acceptable price."
