"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $850,000 is too far below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $950,000?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and $900,000 is getting closer. However, I still need to make a profit. How about $925,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $912,500? ",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $912,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's split the difference and go with $918,750. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",918750.0,Alice,7,
