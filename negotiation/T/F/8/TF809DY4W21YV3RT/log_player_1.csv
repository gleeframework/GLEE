Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous offer. It's close to my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  I'm willing to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
