"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 113}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $113.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a better price than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $112 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
