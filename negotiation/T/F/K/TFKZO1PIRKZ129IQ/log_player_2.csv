"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Alice's offer is good, you can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring the negotiation further and seeing if you can get closer to your ideal price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm open to further discussion.

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000, and it's within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you ending up paying John's price is too high."
