"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $1,400,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to acquire this product for a bit less.  I'm willing to offer you $1,250,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm open to further discussion.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
