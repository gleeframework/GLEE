{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still above my maximum value of $100. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

$85 is still within my budget and a good deal compared to buying from John for $100.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the product."
