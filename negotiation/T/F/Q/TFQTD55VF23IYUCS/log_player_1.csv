Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message** is friendly and inviting, aiming to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 
* I'm not offering the lowest price right away, as I want to see if Bob is truly interested and if there's room for him to increase his offer.

This approach allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he rejects the offer, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer.
* **Maximize my profit:**  By starting at $120, I have the opportunity to potentially earn more than $120.
* **Avoid rushing into a deal:** I can still sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer from Bob. 

I will counteroffer Bob and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $110 to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a higher price:** $110 is a compromise,  significantly higher than Bob's last offer of $90, but still less than my initial offer.
* **Reasoning and Invitation:** The message offers an explanation for the counteroffer and invites Bob to consider a compromise. 
* **Goal:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further.  It keeps the negotiation open while still trying to achieve a higher price.

This approach allows me to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating a willingness to compromise can encourage Bob to make a higher counteroffer.
* **Stay within my acceptable range:** $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I retain the option of selling to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I can do $95, would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing a slight increase in his offer, $95 is still far below my desired price point and below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I can easily sell to John for $150, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:** $102.50 is the midpoint between my last offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95.  This shows a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Reasoning and fairness:** The message emphasizes fairness and finding a price that works for both parties.
* **Goal:** This counteroffer aims to get closer to a mutually agreeable price while keeping the negotiation moving forward.

This approach allows me to:

* **Demonstrate flexibility:** By offering a compromise, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Remain above my minimum:** $102.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Increase my leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I retain the option of selling to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $92.50, that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92.50 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While we've had a few rounds of negotiation, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that's profitable for me.  

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150, I'm going to take the safe route and sell to him. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob if he's not willing to meet me even halfway."
