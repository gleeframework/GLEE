Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** By mentioning that I know he's interested, I'm appealing to his desire to get the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Ending with ""Let me know what you think!"" signals that I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

This opening offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price. If he rejects, I can use his counteroffer to assess his willingness to pay and adjust my own offer accordingly. If things go south, I have the backup option of selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While $9,000 is better than John's $8,000 offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and leaves me with a smaller profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's interest and counteroffer indicate that there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground.  This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward and gives me a better chance of securing a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I've linked my counteroffer to my initial price, reminding Bob of the value I'm placing on the product. 
* **Openness:** Ending with ""Would you be willing to meet me halfway..."" keeps the door open for further discussion.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

*  **Increase my profit:**  $10,500 is a more favorable price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I'm showing that I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Maintain a positive relationship:**  My message remains polite and accommodating, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While not my ideal price, $9,500 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Little room for improvement:**  It's unlikely Bob will budge further, and a counteroffer could potentially lead to him walking away, leaving me with John's $8,000 offer. 
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I might risk losing both buyers.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to maximize my profit. It's a good deal considering my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing both buyers by pushing for a higher price."
