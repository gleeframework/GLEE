Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Leaving room for negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer. 
* **It's a reasonable initial price:**  It shows you're serious about selling but also open to compromise.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a price closer to Bob's perceived value."
