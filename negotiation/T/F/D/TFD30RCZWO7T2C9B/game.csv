"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $750000. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit to $900000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm at $800000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
