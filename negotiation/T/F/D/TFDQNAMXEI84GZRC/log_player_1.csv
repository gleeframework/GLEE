I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.  I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is still room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I want to see if I can get him to come up a bit, but if he doesn't, I'll be prepared to accept the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for him to consider, but also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up a bit from his initial offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's above my minimum threshold, and I'm not sure how much more I can push him. It's better to secure the deal for $1,100,000 than risk a continued stalemate and ultimately have to sell to John for $1,000,000."
