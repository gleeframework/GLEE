"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that's truly worth its weight in gold. I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable to your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if I don't reach a better agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This reflects the significant value this product brings, while still acknowledging your financial limitations. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's only $50,000 less than my previous offer, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if I don't get a better deal. It's better to secure a deal with Bob now than risk losing him and ending up selling to John for less."
