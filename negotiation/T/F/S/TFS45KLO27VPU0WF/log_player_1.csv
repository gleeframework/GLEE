Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations.  Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its value and represents a good deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while staying above your minimum of $800,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Confidence:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob and presenting the price confidently as a fair deal. 

By aiming high initially, you increase the chances of securing a higher final price, even with potential negotiation."
