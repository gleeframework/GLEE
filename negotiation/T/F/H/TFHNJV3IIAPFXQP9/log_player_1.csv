"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. I think it would be a great fit for your needs. I'm asking for $22,000 to start the negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000), I aim to set a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price gives me significant room to negotiate downwards throughout the 10 rounds.
* **Preserving the Option of John:**  While I'm engaging with Bob, I always have the fallback option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Let's start with $12,000 and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, his message suggests willingness to negotiate. I want to explore if we can reach a price closer to my target.
* **John as a Back-up:**  I'll keep John in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $22,000 might have been a high starting point, $12,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, But Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial drop from my initial price to demonstrate flexibility and signal a willingness to make a deal. However, the $18,000 counteroffer keeps me well above both my minimum acceptable price and Bob's initial offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle Tactic:** This common negotiation strategy can be psychologically appealing as it suggests fairness and compromise. 
* **Continuing to Gauge Bob's Interest:** This counteroffer will help me better understand how much Bob is truly willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $15,000?  It's a fair compromise and closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 matches my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will agree, and I risk him walking away. 
* **Time Value and Certainty:** Accepting now provides a sure sale at a reasonable price, rather than potentially prolonging negotiations and risking no deal with Bob."
