Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I'm looking for a quick sale, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $15,000 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob would accept a slightly lower price.  
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested but wants to negotiate. 
* **Quick Sale Incentive:** Highlighting the ""quick sale"" aspect might entice Bob to act fast and accept the offer.

**Important:** It's crucial to balance getting the best price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If you're uncomfortable with any negotiation, accepting John's $15,000 guarantee is a safe option."
