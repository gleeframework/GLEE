``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see the value in this product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?

You have three options:

While $11,000 is closer to your target, you're still paying more than the product's worth to you. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I can see you're making a serious offer. I'm willing to meet you at $10750. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above your target price of $10,000.  Since you can get the product from John for your target price, it makes more sense to go with John's offer."
