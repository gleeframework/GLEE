{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn a higher price. I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $150, which sets a minimum acceptable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even lower than his own perceived value of $100.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $140, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150 and still within a range where Bob might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's closer to my desired price and  I'm willing to accept it, given that John is waiting to buy the product from me for $150.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us."
