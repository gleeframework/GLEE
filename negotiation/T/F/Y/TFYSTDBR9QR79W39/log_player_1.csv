{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It's also not excessively high, so it's likely to be considered by Bob.  We'll see how he responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $1,100,000? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I need to try and get closer to my target price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your offer carefully. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I would like to propose a price of $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product to me. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and it's higher than the guaranteed offer from John. It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept it."
