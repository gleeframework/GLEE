"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is my maximum offer, considering the value I see in it. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  Given the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1750000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1400000 still falls short of my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1600000 as a final compromise. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
