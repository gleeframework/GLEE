"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure will bring you great value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its exceptional qualities and the potential it holds. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1700000. Can you consider that?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1900000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1800000, but I need to make a final offer. If you can meet me at $1800000, I'm willing to make the deal happen. Can you consider that?",1800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really serious about the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1850000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1800000, but I need to be honest, I'm starting to get a bit worried that I might not be able to get a better deal. Can you really not go any lower?",1800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one last offer: $1825000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. What are your thoughts?",1825000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1800000, but I'm not going any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider other options, including buying the product from John for $1500000. Is that the final offer?",1800000.0,Bob,10,
