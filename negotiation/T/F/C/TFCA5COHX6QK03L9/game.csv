"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we try $16,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I'm looking for.",16000.0,Alice,5,
