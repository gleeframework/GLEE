"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly above your maximum budget. It makes much more sense to negotiate rather than accepting this initial price or going with John right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a strong starting point:

* **Aggressive but within reason:**  Starting low gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying well below your $15,000 limit. 
* **Polite and expresses interest:** Shows you're serious about buying but not desperate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to your range, $18,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer.  There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your $15,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on this unique product."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Splitting:** By proposing $13,000, we're suggesting a price point almost exactly in the middle of the current negotiation range ($10,000 - $18,000). This can be a powerful negotiation tactic as it makes your offer seem more ""fair"" and encourages movement from the other party.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  Importantly, this counteroffer keeps us well within your $15,000 maximum, leaving some room for a possible final compromise if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  We reiterate your interest and highlight the product's ""unique"" nature (using Alice's previous language) to justify the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we try $16,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but $16,000 is still above your ideal price and what John offers. There's a chance you can negotiate her down further, so it's worth at least one more counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers.  Would you consider $14,500?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counter-offer shows Alice that you are willing to compromise and move closer to her price while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Specific Figure:** Using a precise number like $14,500 makes the offer feel more considered and less like a simple round number. 
* **Last Chance Tactic:**  While the message is open to further negotiation, this counter-offer subtly signals that you're getting close to your limit and might consider John's offer soon."
