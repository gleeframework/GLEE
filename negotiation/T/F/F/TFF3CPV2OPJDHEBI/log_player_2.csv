"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is lower than John's price, but still above Alice's own valuation. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer and proposing a counteroffer, you might be able to secure a better deal without risking losing the opportunity to buy from John at $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer aims to anchor the negotiation closer to your target price. While $110 is a significant jump from $140, it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Open:**  The message maintains a positive tone and expresses continued interest in the product. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without seeming aggressive. 
* **Strategic Consideration:**  You're starting below Alice's valuation ($120) to gauge her flexibility. Even if she rejects this initial counteroffer, it provides valuable information for your next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless she makes a more compelling offer.  You're still below your maximum budget and have the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($110) and her current offer ($130). This strategy is often perceived as fair and can help break stalemates.
* **Targeting Alice's Valuation:**  You know Alice values the product at $120. By offering this price, you're giving her the opportunity to make a small profit while securing a good deal for yourself. 
* **Pressure Point:**  This offer is strategically placed.  It pushes Alice to decide if a small profit is better than no deal at all, especially since you have John's offer as a backup."
