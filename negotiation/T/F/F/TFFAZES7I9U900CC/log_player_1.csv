Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at $11,000."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for a potential higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 creates a sense of a ""deal"" for Bob, as it's a significant discount from what he perceives as its value ($8,000). 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly might be more advantageous than waiting for John, even if it means a slightly lower profit. 

This offer balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of a higher selling price."
