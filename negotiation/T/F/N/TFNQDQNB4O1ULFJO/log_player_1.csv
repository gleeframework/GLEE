Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum.  This means a deal is impossible unless one of you changes your valuation.

**The Strategy**

Since a deal within the current valuations is impossible, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor:**  Start with a very high offer, hoping to influence Bob's perception of the product's value. This is risky, as Bob might immediately reject it.
2. **Direct to John:** Knowing Bob won't meet your minimum, you can go directly to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000.

**The Offer (High Anchor Approach)**

While risky, let's try the ""High Anchor"" approach to see if we can push Bob closer to your minimum:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its rarity and value in the market, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1900000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're positioning the product as highly desirable and in demand.
* **High Anchor:** The price is significantly above both your minimum and Bob's maximum, aiming to shift his perception of the product's value.
* **Time Pressure:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to negotiate quickly.

**Important Note:** Be prepared for Bob to reject this offer. If he does, you can always go directly to John."
