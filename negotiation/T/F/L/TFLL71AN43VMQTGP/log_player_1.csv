"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The price is still below my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential counteroffers without jeopardizing my minimum profit.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $115 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to encourage further negotiation and potentially get a price closer to my target. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $120, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not conceding too much. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I'm making a profit.
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both of us, fostering a cooperative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $105. This is my best offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is sticking to his offer of $105, which is below my minimum acceptable price. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  I've already spent three rounds trying to negotiate a better deal. Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of wasting more rounds and potentially reaching a deal that's less favorable than selling to John. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $120, which is a safe and secure option considering the current negotiation impasse."
