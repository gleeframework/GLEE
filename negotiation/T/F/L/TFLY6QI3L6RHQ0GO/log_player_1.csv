Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
 
I'm starting with a high price to give myself room to negotiate. Even if Bob counteroffers significantly lower, I have a good chance of settling on a price higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $160 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I know I have a buyer at $120, so I'll counteroffer and see if I can get him closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that price might be a little high, but I can't go as low as $85.  Could you do $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}

I'm coming down significantly from my initial offer but staying above my minimum to allow for some wiggle room. This offer should signal that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $115 is still a little more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to do $95?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I could push for a bit more, $95 is a decent profit above my minimum. It's not worth the risk of Bob walking away for a potential gain of $5-10."
