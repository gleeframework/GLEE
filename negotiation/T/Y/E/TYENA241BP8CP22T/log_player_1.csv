Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $130 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down while still keeping the price well above my minimum ($100).
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100, which provides me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is above my minimum, it's a significant drop from my initial offer.  I believe Bob is still willing to pay more. I'll counter-offer to see if I can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $110 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still holding firm on a price that represents a significant profit margin for me.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge Bob's price sensitivity and determine our next steps in the negotiation."
