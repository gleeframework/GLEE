"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
