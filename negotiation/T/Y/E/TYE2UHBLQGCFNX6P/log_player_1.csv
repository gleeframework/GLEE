Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.
