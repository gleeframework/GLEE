Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to go below $13,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation when you have a guaranteed price of $12,000 from John."
