{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price:** I'm aiming for a good profit, but I also want to incentivize Bob to negotiate.
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures that Bob has a good incentive to accept.

I'll be ready to adjust my price depending on Bob's response and keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's too close to my minimum acceptable price. I want to try and squeeze out a bit more profit. I will counteroffer with a slightly higher price, but still remain competitive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $850,000 is closer to what I was hoping for, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to your asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me! It's well above my minimum acceptable price and it seems like Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price. It's unlikely I can squeeze out much more. It's time to close the deal and secure a good profit."
