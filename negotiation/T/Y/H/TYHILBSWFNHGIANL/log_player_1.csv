"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  Given its value and potential, I believe a fair starting price is $1,750,000. I'm confident this is a price that reflects the product's worth while also leaving room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $1,300,000 feels more in line with its value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I value your interest and understand your perspective, $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price still reflects the product's value but also demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my threshold.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if we can bridge the gap further.  If we don't find common ground in the next round, I'm prepared to move forward with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue working towards a solution. However, $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,550,000.  This is a fair compromise that demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  I believe this price is a reflection of the product's value, and I'm confident it will be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $1,525,000?  I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Given that we've been negotiating for a few rounds, I'm confident that I won't be able to get a significantly better price.  It's also a better offer than John's offer of $1,500,000.  Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
