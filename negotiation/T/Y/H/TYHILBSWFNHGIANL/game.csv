"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  Given its value and potential, I believe a fair starting price is $1,750,000. I'm confident this is a price that reflects the product's worth while also leaving room for negotiation. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $1,300,000 feels more in line with its value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I value your interest and understand your perspective, $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price still reflects the product's value but also demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. ",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue working towards a solution. However, $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,550,000.  This is a fair compromise that demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  I believe this price is a reflection of the product's value, and I'm confident it will be beneficial for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
