{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than my minimum of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, hoping to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Could you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $12,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. Would you be willing to consider $12200? It's a bit closer to your initial offer, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  $12,200 is relatively close to my initial offer and a good deal for both of us.  There's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a lower price, or I might end up selling to John for less.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and closes the deal."
