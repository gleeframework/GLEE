"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $10,000.  I think that's a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that we both want to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
