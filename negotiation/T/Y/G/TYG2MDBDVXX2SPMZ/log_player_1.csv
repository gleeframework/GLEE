Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's worth to me, subtly implying it's worth more than what I'm asking. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price is lower than my minimum value, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate. 

This approach aims to:

* **Get Bob interested:** The offer is attractive, even if slightly higher than his perceived value.
* **Start negotiation:**  It sets a starting point for the negotiation process.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I retain my ability to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  Accepting his offer would be a huge loss for me.  While selling to John for $15,000 is an option, I'll try to negotiate with Bob first to see if I can get a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $6,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I show that I've considered his counteroffer.
* **Firm but fair:** I state my counteroffer is still a good deal for Bob. 
* **Seek compromise:** I use language like ""middle ground"" to signal a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Maintain leverage:** The price is still above Bob's offer and below my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation while keeping my options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still far from ideal. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  While I appreciate your offer, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show progress:** I acknowledge that we are moving closer to an agreement.
* **Meet in the middle:** I suggest a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Appeal to fairness:**  I frame the offer as a fair price for both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintain leverage:**  This price is still above Bob's offer, but also closer to my minimum, showing a willingness to compromise."
