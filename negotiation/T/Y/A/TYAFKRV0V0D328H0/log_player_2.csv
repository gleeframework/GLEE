"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it's worth $950,000. We're confident this price reflects not only the product's worth but also the opportunity it presents for both of us. Please let me know if this offer aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's a significant gap to bridge.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** While it's expensive, it guarantees you'll get the product. 

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice.  A good starting point would be significantly lower than her offer, but still above her minimum price."

I'm open to further discussion, but I need to stay within this price range."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. After careful consideration, I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the product's value and market positioning, I propose a revised price of $900,000. This still maintains a significant profit margin for us while acknowledging your budget constraints. I look forward to your feedback on this proposal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above your desired price point and leaves you little room to negotiate further.
* **You can likely get a better deal.**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you've demonstrated your willingness to walk away. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option, but you want to save money.**

**Next Steps:**  Make another counteroffer. This time, aim for a price closer to your ideal range but still above Alice's minimum. You can try something like $875,000."
