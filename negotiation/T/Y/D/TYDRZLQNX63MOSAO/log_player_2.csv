"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a lower counteroffer allows room for negotiation. It's a good strategy to aim lower than my actual maximum price ($120) but higher than Alice's minimum ($100)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you in the middle at $105. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to see if I can get her down a bit further before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, Alice. How about we settle on $95? That's a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm inching my counteroffer closer to her last offer, signaling that I'm willing to compromise.  This price point is still within a comfortable range for me, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $95. I can do $98, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $98 is a good deal for me. It's below my initial maximum and a significant savings compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate for a few dollars risks losing the deal altogether, and it's unlikely I'll get a much better price from Alice at this point."
