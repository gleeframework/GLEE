Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,200,000, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter-offer and try to close the deal closer to my desired amount."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer is a good compromise and a significant profit for me.  It's better to secure the deal now than to risk losing him and having to settle for John's lower offer."
