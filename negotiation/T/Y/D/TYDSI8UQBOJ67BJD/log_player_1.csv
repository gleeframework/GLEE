Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested, and we can finalize the details. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,250,000, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives Bob a good deal and me a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive and appealing way, emphasizing the value for Bob. I'm also leaving the door open for negotiation if he's not happy with the initial price.

**Why this approach?**

This approach balances maximizing my potential earnings with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I increase the chances of him accepting the offer. However, the price is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to achieve a good profit even if Bob rejects and I have to sell to John."
