Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit well above your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $15,000 to him, so there's room for him to counter with a lower offer, and for you to counter back.
* **It shows you're serious about a deal:**  By not starting with a ridiculously high price, you show Bob you're open to negotiation and a fair deal."
