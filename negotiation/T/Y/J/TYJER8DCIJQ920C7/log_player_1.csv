Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge the value of the product, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product, which is still within a reasonable range considering its potential benefits. I'm confident this price represents a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
