"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's something that could potentially save you a lot of money and increase your efficiency. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this is a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, you know you can get the product for less from John. By rejecting this offer, you're strategically putting yourself in a position to get a better deal without exceeding your budget."
