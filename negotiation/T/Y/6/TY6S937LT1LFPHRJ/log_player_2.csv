"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. If not, I'll be selling it to someone else for a slightly lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob opens the possibility that Alice might lower her price to get a sale.  Even if Alice doesn't lower her price, Bob can still buy from John at the same price."
