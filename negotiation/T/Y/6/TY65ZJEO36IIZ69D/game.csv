"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to make a starting point. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000 to start. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",16000.0,Alice,5,
