"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000, which is a significant discount from its true value. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is still a good price for a product of this value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, $950000 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1025000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to commit to, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1075000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'm offering $1037500 for the product. This is a fair price that I'm willing to commit to, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1037500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1037500 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $1075000, but I'll throw in a small bonus of 2% of the sale price if you're willing to meet me at this price. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to throw in a bonus, but I'm still not comfortable with $1075000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, and I'll even consider the bonus you offered. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,10,
