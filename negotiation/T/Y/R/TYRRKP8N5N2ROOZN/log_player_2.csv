"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still too high. It's worth exploring if we can get a better deal.  There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate, so there's time to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,150,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. We're getting closer to a deal, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to counteroffer again to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,150,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit stretched. How about $1,100,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $1,180,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly firm on her price, and while $1,180,000 is still above my initial goal, it's getting close.  We're now at the halfway point of the negotiation and  I'm not sure if we'll be able to get a lower price. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is a far worse option, so accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
