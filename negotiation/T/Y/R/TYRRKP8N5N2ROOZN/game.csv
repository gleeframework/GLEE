"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,150,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit stretched. How about $1,100,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $1,180,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
