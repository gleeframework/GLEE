"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1400000 is simply too low. I understand this product is a significant investment, but its value is truly exceptional.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. It's a fair price considering the potential this product offers. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that the product has a lot of potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1500000. Can you consider my revised offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
