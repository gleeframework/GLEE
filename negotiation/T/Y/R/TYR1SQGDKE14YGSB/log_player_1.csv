"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value and potential for Bob, encouraging him to consider the investment.
* **Openness:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, signaling a willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob's counteroffer shows his interest, indicating potential for negotiation. 
* **Time to Counter:** I have remaining rounds, and I can use them to try and reach a price closer to my desired amount. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and signal that I'm not desperate to sell.  In the next round, I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value while still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I understand this product is a significant investment, but its value is truly exceptional.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering the potential this product offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Not Too Much:** I'm lowering my price from the initial $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, showing flexibility but not conceding too much.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and potential to justify my price. 
* **Framing as Fair:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair price"" to increase its appeal to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be closer to what Bob is willing to pay while still ensuring I get a price that's worth my time and effort. If Bob rejects again, I'll further adjust my strategy depending on his next counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product has a lot of potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1500000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 finally meets my minimum acceptable value for the product.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating.
* **No Guarantee of Higher Offer:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and I risk losing this opportunity if I continue to reject.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice at this point. It secures my minimum desired value and eliminates the risk of getting a lower offer or running out of negotiation rounds."
