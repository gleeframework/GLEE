"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my profit, so I start with a high price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm offering a price below Bob's perceived value, so he's more likely to accept.
* **Focusing on the value:** I highlight the benefit to Bob, emphasizing the potential savings he could make. 
* **Setting the stage for negotiation:**  This initial offer establishes a starting point for future rounds, if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $110 is above my minimum acceptable price ($120), it's significantly lower than my initial offer.  I want to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's counteroffer indicates his willingness to pay more than $110. 
* **Keeping options open:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round and try to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's compromise.  How about $125?  That's still below your perceived value and closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reiterating the value:**  I remind Bob of the product's worth to him, reinforcing the value proposition.
* **Maintaining control:** I'm not conceding too much but keeping the negotiation moving in a positive direction. 
* **Creating urgency:**  By suggesting a compromise, I'm implying that this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $117? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my goal:** While $117 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Room for improvement:** Bob is clearly willing to pay more than $110.  I believe I can get him to come up a bit more.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm committed to getting a price closer to my desired value.
* **Keeping options open:**  Rejection allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  I can't go lower than $120, as that's my minimum.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $118.50?  That's a good price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 118.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final stand:** I'm offering my final price, which is just above my minimum acceptable price. This shows firmness and commitment. 
* **Compromise offer:** I'm suggesting a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Focus on closure:** I'm emphasizing the desire for a deal and the benefits of reaching an agreement. 
* **Urgency:**  By implying that this might be my final offer, I'm encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously and avoid further negotiation."
