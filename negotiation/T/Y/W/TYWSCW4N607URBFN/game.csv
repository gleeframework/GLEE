"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think I've already gone as far as I can. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
