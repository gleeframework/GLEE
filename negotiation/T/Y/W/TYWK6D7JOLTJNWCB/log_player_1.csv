Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I'm aware that I could get $150 from John, but I'm hoping to get more from Bob if he values the product higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not convinced that's the best I can do. I'm going to try to get a higher price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $175.  This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is better than John's offer of $150, so I'll accept it.  This ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
