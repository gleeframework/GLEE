"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the price in Bob's mind and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Not Too Aggressive:** While we want a high price, starting at $1,200,000 (Bob's full perceived value) might be too aggressive and lead to an immediate rejection. 
* **Leaving Room:** The $1,100,000 offer leaves a $100,000 potential profit for Bob, incentivizing him while still securing a significant portion of the product's value for Alice. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message aims to be polite and collaborative while also gauging Bob's initial interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than our desired outcome. While it's higher than our safety net (selling to John), we have room to negotiate and aim for a better price. We're still in the early rounds, so there's no need to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm open to negotiation but need to land closer to my valuation. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We are lowering our price from the initial offer to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 
* **But Hold Firm:**  The counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, indicating we're serious about a higher price point.
* **Find Middle Ground:** We've moved $50,000 from our initial offer, aiming for a compromise closer to the middle ground between the two previous offers.
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement and maintains a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would allow both of us to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,000,000 represents a $200,000 profit over our minimum acceptable price from John. This is a significant gain.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 demonstrates his willingness to compromise and find a middle ground. It suggests he's motivated to make a deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we could push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away altogether. Accepting now secures a very good outcome. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Accepting a strong offer now reduces the risk of running out of rounds and being forced to accept a less favorable outcome."
