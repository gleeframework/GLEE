"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm open to negotiation but need to land closer to my valuation. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would allow both of us to get a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
