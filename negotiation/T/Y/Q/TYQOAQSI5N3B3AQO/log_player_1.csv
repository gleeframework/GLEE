Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in the potential value it could bring, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you think the product has unique benefits, but I still think $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

We're getting close, but I'm still holding out for a better offer from Bob.  We're only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm encouraged we're finding common ground. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,225,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us, especially considering the long-term value this product will bring to your business."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I still think $1,225,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000, which I believe is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm looking for a good deal, but I'm also looking for a price that I can comfortably pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough one!  It's tempting to hold out for more, but we are getting very close to my walk-away point. Bob is moving slowly, but he IS moving. Let's weigh the options:

* **Accept $1,175,000:** This is a sure thing, and only $25,000 under my absolute minimum.
* **Reject and Counter:**  There's a chance Bob could walk away entirely, or dig in even more.  He's proven to be a tough negotiator.
* **Sell to John:** This is my safety net, guaranteeing $1,200,000. It means losing out on potential profit, though.

Given the circumstances, the safest option is to secure a win. Bob is unlikely to go much higher.

While I could push for the extra $25,000, accepting $1,175,000 minimizes risk at this stage.  A bird in the hand, as they say!"
