"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,125? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges both of our positions.",8125.0,Alice,5,
