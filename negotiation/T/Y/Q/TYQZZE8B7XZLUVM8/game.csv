"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $9,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I've already compromised significantly by meeting you halfway earlier. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,750. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",9750.0,Alice,5,
