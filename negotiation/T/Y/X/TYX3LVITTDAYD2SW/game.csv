"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with an offer of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of this product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $14000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $13000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me. Let's close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'll make a compromise at $13750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",13750.0,Alice,5,
