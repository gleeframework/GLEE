"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $110. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is cheaper than John's price, you can potentially get a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  $110 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  How about $95?  I'm really interested in this product, so I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $95 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$105 is a good compromise and falls within my budget of $120. It's a better deal than buying from John, and Alice seems willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer will save me money and allow me to get the product."
