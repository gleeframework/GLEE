"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $950,000, reflecting its true worth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While you're willing to spend up to $800,000, her offer of $950,000 is significantly more. You know John will sell you the same product for $800,000, making it the better financial decision."
