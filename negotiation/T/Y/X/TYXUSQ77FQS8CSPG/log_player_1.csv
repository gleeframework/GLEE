Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $950,000, reflecting its true worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Confident Tone:**  The message aims to convey the product's value and create a sense of exclusivity, potentially encouraging Bob to accept the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Negotiation is dynamic, and if Bob rejects this initial offer, you (as Alice) might consider a slightly lower price, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
