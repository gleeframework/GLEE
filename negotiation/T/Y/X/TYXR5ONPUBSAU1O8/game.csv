"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider $7500? I'm really interested in this product and I think it's fair value.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  $8500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair and reasonable for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
