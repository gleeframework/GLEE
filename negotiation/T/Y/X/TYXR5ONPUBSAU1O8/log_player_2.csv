"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $10,000, accepting Alice's offer would use up his entire budget with no room for negotiation. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider $7,500? I'm really interested in this product and I think it's fair value."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to Bob's preferred price, it's still above his ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get closer to his desired $7,500 price."
