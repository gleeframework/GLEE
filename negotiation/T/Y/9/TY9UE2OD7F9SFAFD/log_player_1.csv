{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although it's a little less than I hoped for, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a sale than to try to push for a higher price and potentially end up with nothing."
