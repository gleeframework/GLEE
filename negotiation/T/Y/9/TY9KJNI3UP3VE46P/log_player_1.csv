Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 (John), you can start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $19,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial high price also helps gauge Bob's level of interest. If he flat out refuses, you haven't lost anything. 

**Important:** It's crucial to be prepared to negotiate downwards if Bob shows resistance to the initial price. You might want to have a lower limit in mind, below which you wouldn't go."
