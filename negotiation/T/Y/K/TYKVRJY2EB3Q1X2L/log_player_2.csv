"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value to us and the potential it holds for you, I propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is above your maximum budget of $800,000. You want to save as much money as possible, so it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and the market conditions, I am willing to lower the price to $825,000. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $825,000 is closer to my budget, I can still do better. I'm determined to get the product for as close to $800,000 as possible.  By rejecting the offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $825,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
