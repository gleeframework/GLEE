{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to create a positive impression."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. How about $140? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground. $140 is closer to my initial offer but still lower than my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While my ideal price is higher, accepting Bob's offer for $125 is still a good outcome. It's above my minimum value of $120, and any further negotiation might risk losing the sale entirely."
