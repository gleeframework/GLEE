"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,5,
