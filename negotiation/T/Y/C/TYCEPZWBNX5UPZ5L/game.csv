"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,000,000 is a significant investment, I believe it undervalues the potential returns you'll gain.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in the product and represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let's aim for a quick agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. This reflects my desire to close the deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized.  What do you say, shall we shake on it?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
