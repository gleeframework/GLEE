"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob will get. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm not making a hard ultimatum, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm aware of my alternative buyer, John, and will be mindful of my minimum price throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is an improvement from his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity to Negotiate Further:** I'm willing to engage in further negotiation to see if I can reach a more favorable price.
* **Keeping John as a Safety Net:** I'm aware of my backup option with John, which gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by much. This indicates I'm serious about selling to Bob but also value the product.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I emphasize a ""fair deal"" for both of us to try and resonate with Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Positive Tone:** I keep the message positive and encouraging to maintain a good relationship and keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Strategic Price:** $9,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, but it gives him room to counteroffer and allows me to see if he's truly serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 than any previous offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer is high.
* **Fair Compromise:** $9,000 represents a fair compromise, considering Bob's initial value and my own minimum price.
* **Time is Money:** Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good deal and move on to other opportunities.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, the risk of losing the deal and getting less from John outweighs the potential gain from further negotiation at this stage."
