"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price while still offering her a profit margin. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and if Alice rejects it, you can continue to adjust your offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is within your budget and closer to your ideal price.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is now greater. It's a good compromise to accept the offer and secure the product."
