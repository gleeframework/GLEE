"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above my ideal target. I want to see if I can push for a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. It's a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves some room for you to benefit significantly, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is a much better price than her initial offer.  While I still prefer to pay less, it's getting close to my ideal target and definitely a better deal than buying from John.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a good price and avoids further negotiation."
