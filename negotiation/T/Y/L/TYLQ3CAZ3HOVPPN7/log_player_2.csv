"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is your maximum budget.  There's no reason to accept it immediately. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting lower:** A counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $125 is a reasonable starting point, giving Alice some room to come down while still allowing you to save money. 
* **Being polite:**  A friendly message shows you're interested in a fair deal, even if it's less than her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $135, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget:**  $135 is still lower than the $150 you'd pay John, making it a better deal for you.
* **Final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Rejecting it risks losing the deal entirely and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. 

It's always a gamble when accepting a final offer, but in this case, the risk of losing the deal is higher than the potential benefit of continuing to negotiate."
