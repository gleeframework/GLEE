"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's close the deal.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'll sell the product to you for $17,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $15,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make it worth my while. I'll sell the product to you for $16,500. It's a bit more than your original offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but I need to make a bit more profit to make this deal worthwhile. I'll sell the product to you for $16,200. It's a small increase, but I'm confident it's worth it for both of us.",16200.0,Alice,7,
