"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This price would be fair for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,020,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
