"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $12,000 at this time. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still above your value for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $14,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What are your thoughts?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, which is a good compromise. This deal is still beneficial to you as you'd be making a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is a compromise from my previous offer. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but I'm willing to accommodate your budget. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you are trying to get the best price for your product.  However, $13,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price, as it is more than what the product is worth to me, and it's still closer to your last offer. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 4. I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  While I'm interested in your product, I'm still not willing to go above $12,500. This is a good compromise, and still lets you make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",12500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $12,800, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,9,
