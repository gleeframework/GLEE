"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $120 is a decent price, there's a good chance you can get a better deal. Alice is starting quite high above her own valuation of the product. Rejecting her offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to your desired price range."
