"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. To start, let me propose a price of $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come closer to your offer. I am proposing a price of $900000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing a fair return for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely secure a better deal if he keeps pushing.  It's better to keep trying to lower the price rather than settling at $900,000, especially since John is still an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $900,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your proposal and am willing to agree on a price of $890000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, Bob is still closer to his target price of $850,000. There's still a $40,000 gap, and it's worth trying to close that gap before accepting.  It's better to keep pushing for a lower price, as John is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $890,000 is closer, but I'm still a little higher than where I need to be. I'm willing to go to $880,000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 880000}
