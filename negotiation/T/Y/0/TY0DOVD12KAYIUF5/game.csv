"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come closer to your offer. I am proposing a price of $900000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing a fair return for us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $900000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $875000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
