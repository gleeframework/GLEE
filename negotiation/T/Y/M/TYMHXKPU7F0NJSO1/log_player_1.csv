"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  Framing it as a ""great deal for both of us"" emphasizes the potential win-win situation. 
* **First offer is crucial:** This initial offer sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $8,800 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $8,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and reach a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 provides leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand it's a bit lower than my initial price. However, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let's find a middle ground, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer to show willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and focusing on finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Emphasize the benefits:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $9,000, both of us can still benefit. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum and allows for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,700 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $8,700 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation still possible:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation.
* **John's offer provides security:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $8,700 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Move closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing a continued willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but not by much.
* **Maintain a positive but firm tone:** I want to avoid sounding overly aggressive while still demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my minimum.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Leave room for one more counter-offer:** This price allows for one more round of negotiation if Bob rejects this offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I am willing to pay $8,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $8,600 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **We are nearing the end:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob increases.
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 provides me with a strong fallback option. I can hold out for a better price from Bob without excessive risk."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $8,600 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 for this final round of negotiations. This is my last offer.  If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to move on to other options.  What's your final decision?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but final offer:**  I'm making it clear this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.

* **Emphasis on limited options:**  I'm reminding Bob that if he rejects this offer, I'll have to explore other options, potentially selling to John for a higher price.
* **Setting the stage for a decision:** This offer forces Bob to make a final decision."
