``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has remained firm at $1,200,000 for two rounds. This suggests he may not be willing to go higher. While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer secures an extra $200,000. It's better to take a sure profit now than risk getting stuck in further negotiations and potentially ending up with John's offer as the fallback."
