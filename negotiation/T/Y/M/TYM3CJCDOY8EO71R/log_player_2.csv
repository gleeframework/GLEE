**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000.  Since we have a guaranteed option with John for $800,000, it makes more sense to take the sure deal and save the extra $50,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a risk of her not budging, forcing us to take the $800,000 anyway."
