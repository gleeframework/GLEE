"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the compromise, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $820,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",820000.0,Alice,3,
