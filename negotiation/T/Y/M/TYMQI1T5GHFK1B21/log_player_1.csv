Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1050000, but I'd like to propose a 5% discount if you're willing to throw in some additional support and training for the product. What do you think?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even with the discount, I'm not comfortable with his price and I believe I can still get closer to my target.  The extra support and training is a good idea, but I can offer that independently of a lower price."
