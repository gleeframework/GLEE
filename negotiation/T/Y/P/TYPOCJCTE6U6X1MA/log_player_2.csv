"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,450,000.**  This is more than you're willing to pay ($1,500,000 maximum).
* **John's offer is $1,500,000.**  While this is your maximum, it's still better than Alice's offer.

**Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John allows you to save $50,000.**"
