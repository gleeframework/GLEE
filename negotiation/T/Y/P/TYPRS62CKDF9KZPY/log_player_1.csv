"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good deal.  This also allows room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can find a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still maintaining a margin above my minimum.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and may entice Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal with further negotiation.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John for $12,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm dropping my price again, but it's still above my minimum and close to John's offer.  Hopefully, this shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower."
