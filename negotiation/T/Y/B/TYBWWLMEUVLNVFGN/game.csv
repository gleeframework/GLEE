"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150.  This would still allow me to get a fair price for the product while also giving you a good deal. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $150.  How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?  This seems like a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $137.50 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $145, which is a good compromise and still a fair price for this high-quality product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",145.0,Alice,5,
