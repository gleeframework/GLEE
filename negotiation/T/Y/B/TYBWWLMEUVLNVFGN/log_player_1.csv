"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love!  I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get close to my desired price.  I'm also signaling that I'm open to negotiation, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than rejecting outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.  I'm still open to negotiation, but I need to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150.  This would still allow me to get a fair price for the product while also giving you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm offering $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and also a good compromise considering Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also have a clear bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $150.  How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?  This seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $137.5 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $137.50 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $145, which is a good compromise and still a fair price for this high-quality product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm flexible but also determined to get a reasonable price."
