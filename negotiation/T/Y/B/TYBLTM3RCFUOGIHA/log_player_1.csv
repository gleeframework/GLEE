Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This message is direct and to the point, leaving no room for misinterpretation.

This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and start a potential negotiation. If he rejects, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response. Remember, you can always fall back to John's offer of $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still try to push for a higher price. You have a strong position since Bob has already acknowledged the value of your product. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're not desperate for a quick sale and are willing to negotiate further. You can then counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial, allowing both of us to reach a satisfying agreement."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good strategy:

* **Middle ground:** It splits the difference between your previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,250,000), showing you're willing to compromise.
* **Still above your minimum:** You're still aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000, keeping your profit margin.
* **Positive framing:** The message focuses on mutual benefits, highlighting the potential for a win-win scenario.

This counteroffer maintains a firm stance while demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.  It's likely to encourage Bob to consider a compromise and move closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,287,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,287,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,287,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,287,500 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's a good deal, and it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiations and potential delays.  

Here's why accepting is the best choice:

* **Profit Margin:**  You'll still earn a significant profit of $87,500.
* **Time Savings:**  Continuing negotiations could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 is still available, but there's always a risk that he might back out or change his mind.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a favorable price and avoid the uncertainties of further negotiation."
