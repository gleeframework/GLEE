"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob and hoping to create a positive impression. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message invites Bob to discuss the price, suggesting flexibility on my end. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal while leaving open the possibility of a counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product at such a significant loss.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to my target.  There are still rounds left, and I have the option to sell to John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that satisfies both of our needs and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a good deal on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm not desperate to sell and I have a backup option with John.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $130 is still a bit lower than where I need to be, but I'm willing to go down to $135 to make this deal work.  This is a great product that I'm sure you'll enjoy, and I want to make sure we both walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** I'm offering a slightly lower price to demonstrate my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize value and mutual benefit:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and focusing on the positive outcome of closing the deal.
* **Create urgency:**  I'm suggesting that this is a good opportunity for both of us to find a mutually beneficial outcome.

This counteroffer aims to inch closer to Bob's desired price while still ensuring I receive a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125, which is the lowest I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. We've been negotiating for a few rounds now, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, and it seems unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer. 

To ensure I get a price I'm happy with, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
