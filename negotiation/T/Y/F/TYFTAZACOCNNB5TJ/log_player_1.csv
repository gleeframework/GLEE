Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation helps, Alice should start with a price closer to her own valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't just state a price; it hints at the product's value, making a higher price seem more reasonable. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This offer assumes there's room for negotiation. Alice should be prepared for Bob to counter-offer and have a strategy for reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk that Bob will reject this offer, leading Alice to sell to John at her minimum acceptable price. However, the potential for a higher profit might be worth the risk."
