Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and direct, highlighting the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I aim to:

* **Test Bob's interest:** If he accepts, I've earned more than my minimum.
* **Open room for negotiation:**  If he rejects, it gives him a starting point for his counteroffer.

I'll keep John's offer as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fail or stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for it at this time. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll try to gauge his willingness to negotiate and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to move forward.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and framing my offer as a fair compromise. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price closer to the middle, I'm hoping to:

* **Encourage Bob to accept:** The offer is more appealing than my initial one and potentially more agreeable than John's offer.
* **Show flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a common ground.

If Bob still rejects, I'll need to carefully consider whether to accept John's offer or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your latest offer and while I understand the value of the product, I am unable to go above $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise given our previous discussions. I hope you find this offer acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I've reached a point where the potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the risk of losing time and ultimately accepting a price below my minimum.

**Reasoning:**

* **John's offer:**  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which meets my minimum requirement.
* **Negotiation risk:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob could lead to a stalemate or a further reduction in his offer.
* **Time is valuable:**  Further negotiation could take up time that I could be using to explore other opportunities.

**Conclusion:**

In this situation, the certainty and value of John's offer outweigh the potential risks and uncertainties of continuing negotiations with Bob. I'll accept John's offer and secure the sale at my minimum price."
