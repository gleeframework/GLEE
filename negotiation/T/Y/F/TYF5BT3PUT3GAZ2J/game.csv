"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,250. If we can meet in the middle here, I think we can close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
