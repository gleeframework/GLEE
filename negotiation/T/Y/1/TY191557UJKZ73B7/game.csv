"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested,  $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $155? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's meet in the middle at $150. That's fair for both of us, and I can get it from John for that price if we can't come to an agreement.",150.0,Bob,4,
