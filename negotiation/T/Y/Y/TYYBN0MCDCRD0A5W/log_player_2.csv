"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $120, and John is offering the product for exactly that amount, there's no incentive to negotiate with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price point."
