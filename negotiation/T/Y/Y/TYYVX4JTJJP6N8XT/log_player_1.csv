**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his initial offer and seems unlikely to move significantly closer to Alice's desired price.  At this point, continuing the negotiation poses a greater risk of losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It makes more business sense to cut the losses and take the guaranteed offer."
