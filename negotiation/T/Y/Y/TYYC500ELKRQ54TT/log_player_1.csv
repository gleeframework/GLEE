"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired value. It's early in the negotiation, and I can still try to improve the price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1,100,000.  This is a fantastic product, and this price still represents a significant value for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired value of $1,200,000. There are still rounds left and I believe I can push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,060,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiations are getting increasingly difficult. While Bob is offering more than his initial offer, it is still far below my minimum acceptable price.  I have already reached a point where I'm not confident I can close a deal with Bob that meets my needs. The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and reaching a stalemate is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, so it's the best option at this point."
