"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. While I understand its value to you, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth to both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I must respectfully decline the $875,000 offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $825,000 for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
