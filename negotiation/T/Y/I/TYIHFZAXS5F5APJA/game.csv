"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,500 for the product.  This still represents a great value for you, considering its worth to you is $8,000. Let's find a compromise we can both be happy with.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9,500 is a good deal for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
