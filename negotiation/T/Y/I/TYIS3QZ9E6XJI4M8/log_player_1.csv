"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be highly valuable to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's potential value to Bob. 
* **Open Communication:**  I encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation. 

This initial offer sets a high bar and gives me room to potentially compromise in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $950,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $800,000, it's still below my minimum price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for a better deal, especially considering Bob acknowledged the value of the product. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to explore higher prices.

I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer that's closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the unique value this product offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum price of $1,000,000, ensuring a profitable deal for me.
* **Reinforcing value:** I reiterate the product's unique value to encourage Bob to accept. 

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still holding my ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget, would it be possible to reach an agreement at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Time is valuable:**  We've already had three rounds of negotiations, and continuing to bargain might lead to more rejections and delay the sale.
* **John's offer:** While John is willing to pay $1,000,000, there's no guarantee he'll remain interested if the deal with Bob falls through. 

Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable sale without risking further delays or losing out to John."
