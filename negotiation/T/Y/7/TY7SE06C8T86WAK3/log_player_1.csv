Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still lower than my desired price.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price. Let's see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's.  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $250 less than my minimum acceptable price, and considering the potential for further negotiation, I don't think I'll get a better deal. It's time to accept the offer and move on."
