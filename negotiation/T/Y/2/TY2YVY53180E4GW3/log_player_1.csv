Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $100. While selling to John for $100 is an option, I'd prefer to continue negotiating with Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $120. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum price, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with it.  I'm willing to take a bit of a loss to avoid selling to John, but I believe I can get a better deal from Bob. I'll counteroffer once more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

This time I'm offering $105.  It's still above my minimum, but close enough to Bob's offer that I think it might be acceptable to him.  I'm hoping to close the deal without having to go through more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is close to my minimum, but it's still not enough to satisfy me. I've already made several concessions and don't want to continue negotiating.  At this point, it's more profitable to sell to John for $100.  I don't want to risk going through more rounds and getting a worse offer from Bob."
