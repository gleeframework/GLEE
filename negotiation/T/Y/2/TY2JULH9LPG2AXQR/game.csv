"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd need a price closer to $600,000 to make this work.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $700,000. If you're able to work with that, I think we can make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value this product brings, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Alice,5,
