"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price while still allowing me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's the most I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to ensure I can recoup my costs. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still not enough for me to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
