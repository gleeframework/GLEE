"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's the most I can afford.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to ensure I can recoup my costs. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can secure a better deal with further negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum acceptable value with more rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still not enough for me to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
