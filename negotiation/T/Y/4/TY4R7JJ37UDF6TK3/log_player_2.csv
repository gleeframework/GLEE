This is a great deal, considering the market value of the product is $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice is grossly overvaluing the product and trying to take advantage of you. You can get the product for a much more reasonable price from John."
