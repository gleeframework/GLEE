"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, but I won't go any higher.  Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still too high for me. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my offer of $1000000.  This is the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
