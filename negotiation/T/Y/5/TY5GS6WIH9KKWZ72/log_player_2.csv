# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000.

Alice seems firm on not going below this price. It's a significant saving compared to John's offer, and further haggling might make Alice pull out."
