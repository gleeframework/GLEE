Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit for Alice. 
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product's value exceeds even Bob's valuation, encouraging him to consider a higher price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing further"" signals flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts the initial offer or a negotiated price close to it, Alice earns significantly more than selling to John.
2. **Secure a Favorable Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down, starting high increases the likelihood of a final price above the $800,000 backup offer.
3. **Maintain the Option of John:** If Bob rejects the offer outright, Alice can still sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
