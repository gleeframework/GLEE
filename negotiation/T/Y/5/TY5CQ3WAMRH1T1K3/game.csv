"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
