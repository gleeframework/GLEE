"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle this time.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from $16,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $17,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal this time.",17000.0,Alice,5,
