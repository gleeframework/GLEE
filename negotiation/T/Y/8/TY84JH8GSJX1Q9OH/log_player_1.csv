{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I've started with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive tone:** I've used a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage with the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I've made it clear that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation process.  I'm prepared to potentially lower the price if Bob's counteroffer is reasonable, but I also have a ""walk away"" price of $10,000 to ensure I don't settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still a bit below what I'd like to get.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell and that I believe the product is worth more. This sets the stage for a counteroffer from me in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  Let's meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I've met Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasize meeting in the middle:**  This language suggests flexibility and encourages Bob to see this as a fair compromise.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm staying friendly and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 

By offering $13,500, I'm taking a calculated risk.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to stick with my current negotiation strategy or sell to John. However, I believe that this counteroffer  demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $13500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $12800? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. While I would prefer to get more, I'm running the risk of getting stuck with John's offer of $10,000 if I continue to reject Bob's offers.  

It's time to be practical and secure a sale that's within my acceptable range.  By accepting Bob's offer, I can close the deal and move on."
