"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your prompt response. We acknowledge your position and are pleased to offer a price of $1,085,000 for our product. This is a slight increase from your last offer, but we believe it strikes a good balance between your budgetary constraints and the value of the product. We hope this proposal will be more in line with your expectations and allow us to move forward with a mutually satisfactory agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob has a few factors to consider:

* **Alice's offer is closer to his desired price.**  $1,085,000 is only $25,000 more than his last counteroffer.
* **Further negotiation might not yield much more savings.** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but the gap is shrinking. 
* **John's price is significantly higher.**  While Bob could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving him with John's higher price.

Given these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision. It saves Bob a substantial amount compared to John and represents a good compromise."
