"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. I also want to keep in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $120, so I don't want to lose too much profit by being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I'm confident I can get a better price. While I could sell to John for $120, I want to see if I can get a higher offer from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. This still gives me a decent profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering $95. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but still leaves me with a profit of $15. I'm trying to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still keeping my bottom line in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $80 is a bit low for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $95. How about $87.50? Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob or from John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $87.50 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but shows a continued willingness to negotiate. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is a fair price that would make us both happy. This might motivate Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only four rounds left, it's not worth risking a lower offer from Bob. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $120, which is a better deal for me than accepting Bob's current offer of $88."
