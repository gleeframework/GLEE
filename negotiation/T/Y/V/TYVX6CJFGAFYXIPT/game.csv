"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $12,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. That's the highest I can go.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my minimum. This is a fair price for both of us, as the product is worth this much to you. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm close to your minimum price, but I'd like to get a bit closer to the price I was hoping for. How about $13,500? That's the lowest I can go.",13500.0,Bob,6,
