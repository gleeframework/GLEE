"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 10 rounds to work with, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
