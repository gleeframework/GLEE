"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,350,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. After careful consideration, I am proposing a revised offer of $1,300,000 for the product. This price still allows me to maintain a reasonable margin while providing you with a competitive deal based on the product's value to your business. I hope we can move forward towards a satisfactory agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $1,275,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to make this purchase.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
