Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $15,000, there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price, giving me some profit above his perceived value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is a strong offer that signals the product's value while leaving me room to negotiate down to $13,000 if necessary. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. I don't need to desperately sell to Bob."
