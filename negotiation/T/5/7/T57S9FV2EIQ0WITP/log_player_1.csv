"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still do better.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take the $1,250,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I think there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it seems like Bob is not willing to go higher. With only a few rounds remaining,  the risk of not closing a deal at all is too high.  I'm happy with $1,000,000, and John is a reliable buyer."
