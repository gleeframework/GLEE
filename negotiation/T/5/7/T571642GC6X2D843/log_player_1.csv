Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also expressing confidence in the product's worth to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm countering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a decent profit margin for me.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for the product

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's the same as his previous offer, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference. How about $13,250? This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our last two offers. This shows a willingness to compromise and could be a good point for Bob to accept.  I'm also highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price and reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? I think that's a fair price for the product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $15,000. While I'd like to make more, Bob's counteroffers are consistently below my minimum, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Selling to John guarantees I get my desired price."
