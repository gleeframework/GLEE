Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given its value to you, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's potential and allows for some room for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
