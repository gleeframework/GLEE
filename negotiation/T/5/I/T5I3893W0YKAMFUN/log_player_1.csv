{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and also reflects the value of the product to me.  I'm confident that I can get at least $12,000 from John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to maximize my earnings, $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair compromise that gives Bob a better chance of securing the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has now offered my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount.  I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
