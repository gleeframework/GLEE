"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum threshold but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to work towards a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is still lower than my ideal price but it's a reasonable compromise that acknowledges Bob's offer while leaving room for further negotiations. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $9,500 and is higher than my minimum target of $8,000. I'm going to accept this offer to close the deal and secure a good profit.  There are still 6 rounds left, but the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price isn't worth it."
