"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,001. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $1 better than John's offer. It's not worth paying an extra dollar to avoid dealing with John.  You can get the same product for a lower price from John."
