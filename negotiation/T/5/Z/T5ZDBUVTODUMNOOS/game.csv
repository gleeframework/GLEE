"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've considered your offer carefully, and while I understand your position, I'm unable to agree to $1,075,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,060,000. This is a reasonable compromise that respects both the value of the product to me and your expectations.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
