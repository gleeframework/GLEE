"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.

{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $650,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $875,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $725,000? I'm eager to work towards a deal."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. While $725,000 is appealing, I can't quite justify letting it go for less than $800,000. This is my firm bottom line; I believe it reflects the product's genuine worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice has reached her bottom line and matched John's price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as the price will be the same."
