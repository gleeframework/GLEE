"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'd like to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from that number.  Would you consider $950,000? It's a significant investment for me, and that's where I'm comfortable.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a significant investment for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'd like to counteroffer at $1,020,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
