"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $110, which is still higher than your ideal price. 
*  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I am willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $100. 
* Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point that is halfway between our desired prices. 
* This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still saving me money compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Alice's offer of $115 is still above my ideal price, but it's closer to my limit than her previous offer. 
* It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $105. 
* If Alice rejects this counteroffer, I'll buy from John to avoid getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $115, and I'm willing to pay up to $120. 
* Offering $110 is a compromise that is closer to Alice's offer, but still allows me to save some money.
* This is likely the last counteroffer I'll make. If Alice rejects, I will buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $112.5 is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my limit.
* Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price, and it's possible Alice might raise the price again. 
* Buying from John for $120 is a worse option, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to ensure I get the product at a reasonable price."
