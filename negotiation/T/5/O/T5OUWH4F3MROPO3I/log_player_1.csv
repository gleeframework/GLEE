"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. My starting price is $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $115, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by expressing confidence in the product and showing interest in Bob's perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $100. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm firm on my price of $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to meet you at $98. Would you be willing to sell the product to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm not sure if I can get Bob to go any higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John rather than risk losing both deals by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
