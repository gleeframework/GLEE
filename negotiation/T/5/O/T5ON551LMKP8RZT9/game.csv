"Alice, that starting price is quite high.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense.  How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to move closer to a reasonable price point.  While I believe this product has value, $1,400,000 is still too high.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product.  How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm seeing some movement but we need to bridge this gap faster.  I can go up to $1,050,000, but that's my limit.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your limit.  To be fair to us both, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product brings.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
