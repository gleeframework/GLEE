"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I can get closer to my asking price.",110.0,Alice,3,

I understand that $110 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110.,108.0,Bob,4,
