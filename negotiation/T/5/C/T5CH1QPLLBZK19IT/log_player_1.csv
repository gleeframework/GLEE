Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
