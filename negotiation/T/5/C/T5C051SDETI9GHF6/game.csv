"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $11000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $10000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $11500 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Alice,5,
