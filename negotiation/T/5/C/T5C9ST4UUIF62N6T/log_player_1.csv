Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $135, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This price allows for Bob to make a counteroffer, creating a back-and-forth that might lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Backup:**  Keeping John in mind, I'm not willing to go too low. If Bob rejects the offer, I have a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** My minimum price is $150. Bob's offer is below that.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $120 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to negotiate further. I still have John as a backup, so I can afford to be a bit flexible.
* **Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. How about $130? That's a fair price that gives you a good discount and still allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I provide justification for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product and the compromise I'm making.
* **Fairness:** $130 is still above Bob's desired price but significantly lower than my initial offer. 
* **No John yet:** I'm still hopeful I can close the deal with Bob, so I'm not rushing to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I am unable to go beyond $120. Is there any possibility of reaching an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $150.
* **No Further Compromise:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I've already lowered my price significantly. I don't want to keep going lower, risking a loss on the sale.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money on this deal. 

By selling to John, I secure a sale at my desired price and avoid potentially getting stuck in a protracted negotiation that might result in a lower price."
