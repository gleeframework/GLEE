Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than what it's worth to him.

{""product_price"": $110}

This offer is still a good deal for Bob, as he can buy the product at a price that is $10 less than its value to him. I'm hoping he'll accept the offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $105. Since this is lower than my minimum price of $120, I'll choose to reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that's higher than his previous offer, but still lower than my minimum price of $120.

{""product_price"": $115}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
