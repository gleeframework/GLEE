Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for the highest price Bob might accept, knowing his value is $100. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 allows a buffer for potential counter-offers while staying above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** Briefly mentioning the product's value to Bob reinforces his incentive to buy.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob accepts:** You gain a $10 profit over your next best offer.
* **If Bob rejects:** You still sell the product to John for your minimum acceptable price of $80."
