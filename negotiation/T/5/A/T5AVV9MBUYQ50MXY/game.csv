"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value this product brings, and its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value proposition while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price",1200000.0,Bob,4,
