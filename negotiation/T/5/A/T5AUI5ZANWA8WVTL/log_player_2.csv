Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and offered the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and at this point, the potential savings with Alice are outweighed by the certainty of John's $1,000,000 offer."
