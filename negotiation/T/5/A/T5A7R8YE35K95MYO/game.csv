"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $108. It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can come to an agreement.",108.0,Alice,3,
