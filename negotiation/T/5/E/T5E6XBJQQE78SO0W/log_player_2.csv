"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $145 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a lower price, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's $10 less than Alice's initial offer. This shows good faith while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $135 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above Alice's value for the product.  Bob should continue negotiating, as there's potential to reach an even lower price.  There are still 7 rounds remaining, so it's worthwhile to keep exploring better deals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $138.  Let's split the difference and see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 138}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer, but he's still trying to keep the price below Alice's last offer. This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway, making it more likely Alice will accept."
