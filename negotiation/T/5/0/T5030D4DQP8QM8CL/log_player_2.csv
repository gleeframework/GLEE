"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $1500000 for it.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident that the product's potential will far exceed that price. Let me know if you'd like to discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. Since you know you can buy the product from John for the same price, there is no incentive to accept Alice's offer.  By rejecting, you leave the possibility open for Alice to potentially lower her price to make a deal."
