Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident that the product's potential will far exceed that price. Let me know if you'd like to discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Message:**  I'm highlighting the product's value and potential while acknowledging the high price. This encourages negotiation while expressing confidence in the product. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard deadline or stating that this is my ""final offer,"" which allows for flexibility if Bob wants to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point.  The optimal strategy depends on your assessment of Bob's likely willingness to pay and your risk tolerance.  If you believe Bob might be willing to pay a lot more than $1,500,000, you could start higher.  If you're more risk-averse, you might start closer to John's offer."
