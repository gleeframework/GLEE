,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 at this time.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $14,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
