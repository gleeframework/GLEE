Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain.  What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  I'm offering $8,250. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming closer to our target price, we're still above our absolute limit with John. There's room to negotiate further, and the risk of Alice walking away isn't high yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  We're now at the point where our target price matches our backup option (buying from John). 
*  By directly proposing $8,000 and framing it as a ""split the difference"" compromise, we increase the likelihood of Alice accepting. 
*  If Alice rejects this offer, we still have the option to buy from John without losing anything."
