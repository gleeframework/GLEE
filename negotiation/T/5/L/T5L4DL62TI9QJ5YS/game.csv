,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate.  How about we settle at $7,750?  I feel like that's a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  I'm offering $8,250. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",8000.0,Bob,6,
