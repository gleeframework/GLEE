"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",8000.0,Bob,4,
