"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your absolute limit, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $81. It's a small increase, but it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,5,
