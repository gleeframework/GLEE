"Hi Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It's valued at no less than $10000 to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. My initial offer is $15000. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $8000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the move towards meeting in the middle, I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $9500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $10750.  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your previous offers, but I am still aiming for a price closer to my maximum of $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $10250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
