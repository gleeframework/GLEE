Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It's valued at no less than $10,000 to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. My initial offer is $15,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $8000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, and it's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the move towards meeting in the middle, I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $9500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with it. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $10,750.  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your previous offers, but I am still aiming for a price closer to my maximum of $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $10250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price. It's better to accept his offer and close the deal rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with the lower offer from John."
