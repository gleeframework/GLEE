Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While it's a better price than her first offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has a clear goal to spend less than $1,500,000, and the negotiation is moving in the right direction."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice is getting closer to her minimum:**  Alice is clearly getting closer to her bottom line. There's a good chance that rejecting her offer will only lead to more back-and-forth, potentially ending with a higher price or a stalemate.
* **The price is within Bob's budget:**  $1,125,000 is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  He's getting a good deal and saving a substantial amount of money.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects the offer and keeps negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get tired of the negotiation or that he'll lose the opportunity to buy the product altogether.

While it might be tempting to try for a lower price, accepting Alice's offer at this point is the most logical and financially sensible choice for Bob."
