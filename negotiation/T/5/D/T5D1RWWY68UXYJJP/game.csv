"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice.  While I'm definitely interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit high. I'm confident I can secure the product for $1,100,000. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $1,125,000, which is my absolute lowest price. If you're willing to meet me at this number, I'll consider it a done deal. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
