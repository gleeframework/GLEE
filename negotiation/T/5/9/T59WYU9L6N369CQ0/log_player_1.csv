"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm aiming higher but remain open to further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price you're proposing doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm making a significant concession to signal flexibility but remain above Bob's valuation and my minimum. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has a lot of potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting his offer now would leave money on the table.  I'm willing to take a calculated risk and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,375,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm splitting the difference between his last offer and my previous one. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer and my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer and is now above my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for more, the gains are likely to be incremental at this point. Accepting now secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
