"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more around $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $9,000. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8,500, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with. However, $8,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $8,650? This is a small increase from your last offer, and it's still a good deal for you, given the value of the product.",8650.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,650. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $8,650, which would be $8,575. Would you be willing to consider that?",8575.0,Bob,6,
