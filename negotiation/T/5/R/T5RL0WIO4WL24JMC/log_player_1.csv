"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more around $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $9,000. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8,500, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. $8,500 is too low for me, especially considering John is willing to pay $8,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with. However, $8,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $8,650? This is a small increase from your last offer, and it's still a good deal for you, given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8650}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,650. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $8,650, which would be $8,575. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,575. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,575
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than I hoped for, it's a fair compromise and I'm getting closer to my minimum. It's better than selling to John for $8,000, and we have a few more rounds to see if we can reach a better deal."
