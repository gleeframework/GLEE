"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it's a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John. Even though Alice has lowered her price to $14,000, it is still higher than Bob's budget. Since John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, Bob should go with the better deal."
