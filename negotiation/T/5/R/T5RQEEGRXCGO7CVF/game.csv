"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it's a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering its value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
