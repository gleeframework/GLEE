"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value to me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives him room to negotiate but also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and direct, outlining the value proposition of the deal without being aggressive. I'm also leaving the door open for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while acknowledging that I have a fallback option with John. Starting high allows me to potentially secure a good price, while the possibility of selling to John gives me leverage in case the negotiation doesn't go my way."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a significantly higher price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if I don't get a better price. This strengthens my position in future negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while reiterating my stance that it's too low. I'm emphasizing the discount I'm offering, making it seem like a compromise. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to continue narrowing the gap while maintaining a strong negotiating position.  I'm still significantly above Bob's offer, but showing some willingness to compromise might encourage him to increase his offer in the next round.  I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if the negotiations fail."

```
