"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000. Let me know what you think!",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,800,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount of $50,000 from my initial price. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,750,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking!",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to close the deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $1,550,000 to make this worth my while. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,625,000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,625,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to go up to $1,575,000. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's make this deal happen.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still not convinced that $1,575,000 is enough to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,600,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finally agree on a price.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
