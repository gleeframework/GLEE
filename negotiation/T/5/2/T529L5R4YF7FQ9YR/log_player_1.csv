Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $950,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, a price that still reflects the product's worth but allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.
