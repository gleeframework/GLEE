"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $950,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, a price that still reflects the product's worth but allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet at a higher price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. My counteroffer is $850,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value it brings and is a reasonable compromise between our initial offers.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair deal, and I'm willing to go a bit higher. However, $850,000 still stretches my budget. I'm offering $800,000, my absolute maximum. This price represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects the value I see in this product. I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
