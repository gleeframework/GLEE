Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a higher price than John's offer, but I believe it's a fair starting point. 

Here's why:

* **My minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so anything above that is a profit.
* **Potential for higher value:** I don't know Bob's valuation, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than John. 
* **Negotiation room:**  The $900,000 price gives me some room to negotiate down if needed.

By offering a slightly higher price, I'm incentivizing Bob to consider the offer seriously. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer, ensuring a profit of $100,000."
