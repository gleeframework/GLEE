"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, Bob has the potential to save even more money by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to enter the counter-offer phase and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price and is still below Bob's maximum budget. This aggressive opening counteroffer sets the stage for a negotiation where Bob can potentially secure a price closer to his ideal target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. There are 7 rounds remaining, and the possibility of reaching a price closer to his target of $1,000,000 exists. By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the negotiation alive and maintains leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to his desired $1,000,000.  The $1,050,000 offer is a moderate increase from his previous counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  This approach maintains the negotiation without conceding too much ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good price for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's offer and only $25,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer. There are only 5 rounds remaining, and the chance of getting a better offer from Alice becomes increasingly unlikely. It's strategically beneficial for Bob to accept this offer and secure a good deal, ensuring he gets the product while still saving a significant amount of money."
