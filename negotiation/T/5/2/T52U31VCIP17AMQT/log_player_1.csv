"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $200 for it. It's a great deal, I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $200, knowing it's above my minimum of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a higher potential profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I briefly mention the product being ""fantastic"" to highlight its potential value without revealing too much. 

I'm looking forward to seeing how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I will counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, as it doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $150?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum price of $150, but I'm not being overly aggressive. I'm using a friendly and reasonable tone.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering to meet halfway, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reinforce Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value by stating I'm ""confident you'll be happy."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $125. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not yet ready to accept his offer. I will continue to negotiate to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not comfortable going below $140. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm making a slight concession by lowering my price from $150 to $140. This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate but still ensures I get a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Maintain Value Emphasis:** I remind Bob about the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage further dialogue and keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that we may not be able to reach an agreement.  Rather than continuing to negotiate and risking further price decreases, I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John. This ensures I get a price I'm comfortable with and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that might lead to a lower final price."
