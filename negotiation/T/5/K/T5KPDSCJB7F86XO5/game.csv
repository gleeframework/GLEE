"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? I'm serious about buying it, but that's my limit.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  $90 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
