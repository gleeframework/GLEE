I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a fantastic price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially save more by counteroffering. There's a chance Alice might accept a lower price, and even if she doesn't, you can always choose to buy from John as a backup."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1075000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is closer to your desired price, but it's still above your maximum budget.  Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better deal.  By rejecting her offer, you can potentially bring the price down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $1,025,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to find a balance between value and budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1060000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her latest offer of $1,060,000 is still above your maximum budget.  You can get the product from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's no guarantee she will lower her price further."
