"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll get great use out of it. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm happy to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $9,500?  It's still a good value for you, and it gives me some breathing room.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
