"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. Here's my initial offer: I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit on this deal, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $900,000. I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is my final counteroffer for now.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $750,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
