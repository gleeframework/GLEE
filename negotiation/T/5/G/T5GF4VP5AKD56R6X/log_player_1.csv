{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.** This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob.**  This incentivizes him to accept and gives him a sense of getting a good deal. 

I'm prepared to negotiate further, but this offer gives me a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $9,000 is better than John's offer of $8,000, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $10,000? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to push for a higher price, $10,000 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and significantly better than John's offer.  I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."
