I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm confident John will buy it for $150, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is below my minimum, so I won't accept it. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm lowering the price a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to meet me in the middle."

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can close the gap."

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum. If he rejects this, I'll be ready to sell to John for $150."
