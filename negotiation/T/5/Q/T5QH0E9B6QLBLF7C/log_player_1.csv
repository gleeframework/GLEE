Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving upward, indicating willingness to pay a higher price. We're still above John's offer, and we have room to negotiate. Holding firm now might push Bob closer to our desired price point."

Round 8

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has significantly dropped his offer, and it's now below John's standing offer. While Bob might still be willing to negotiate upwards, it's becoming risky to continue. Accepting John's offer guarantees us the $800,000 and avoids the potential of Bob lowballing further or reaching an impasse."
