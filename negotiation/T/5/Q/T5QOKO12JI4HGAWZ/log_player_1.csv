Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, trying to sell to Bob first at a higher price could yield a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets a $300,000 discount compared to my guaranteed sale price, and I still make a $100,000 profit over my alternative.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning the offer's exclusivity and potential availability to others, I aim to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
