"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to gauge his interest with a relatively high price. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's worth at least $15,000 to me. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable price than my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than what John is offering. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above what I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm still hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm also aware that time is running out and I have a guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $15,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offers and only $500 above John's offer. I'm running out of time, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a final opportunity to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. With only two rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating. John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is more than Bob's offer and meets my minimum requirement. I'm going to sell to John."
