"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,100,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This would still allow me a fair return on the product's value.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  While $1,175,000 is getting more appealing, I still need to be closer to $1,250,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,212,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1212500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to show I'm serious. How about $1,190,000? That's a significant move on my part.",1190000.0,Bob,6,
