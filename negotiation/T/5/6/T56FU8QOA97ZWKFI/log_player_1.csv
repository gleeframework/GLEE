Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer, which gives you leverage.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal. Going too high risks him rejecting the offer outright.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the unique benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Creates a sense of scarcity and value.
* **Fair Deal:**  Framing the price as ""fair"" encourages agreement.
* **$1,350,000 Price:** This is significantly above your minimum and gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters. It also allows Bob to potentially save a substantial amount compared to his valuation.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can decide how low you're willing to go before walking away and selling to John.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in your offer can influence Bob's decision."
