Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is more than your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him room to negotiate without feeling pressured.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  This price shows that you're serious about selling to Bob, but it also makes it clear you're not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1200000?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for potential profit. It's better to continue negotiating with Bob to see if you can reach a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,300,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to achieve a more reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
