"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save $1,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to her $10,000 value, saving Bob even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep.  How about $12,000?  That's still a good profit for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, saving him $2,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and him having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential for an extra few hundred dollars in savings."
