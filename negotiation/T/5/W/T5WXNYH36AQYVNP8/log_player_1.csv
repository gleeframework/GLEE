While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, accepting Bob's offer of $885,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $885,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Bob might not move much higher, and there's always a risk he walks away, leaving me to accept John's lower offer.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations.  

Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
