"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a price that's still beneficial to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
