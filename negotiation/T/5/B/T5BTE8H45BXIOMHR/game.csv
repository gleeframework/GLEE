"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1800000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1900000.0
"I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, I have to consider the value I've attached to this product, and $1800000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1900000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm starting to feel like we're making progress, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1700000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room, but I need to stay above $1700000. How about $1750000?",1750000.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too close to my budget limit, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1650000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me here.",1650000.0,Bob,6,,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not convinced that $1650000 is enough to part with this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1680000?",1680000.0,Alice,7,,

"I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'm making a final offer of $1600000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1600000.0,Bob,8,,

"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm not ready to let the deal slip away yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about we meet in the middle at $1620000?",1620000.0,Alice,9,,
