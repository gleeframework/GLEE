Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential compromise while still securing a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By not starting at my absolute minimum, I have room to negotiate down if Bob's counteroffer is reasonable. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have John's offer for $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position.  If Bob's counteroffers become too low, I can confidently walk away."
