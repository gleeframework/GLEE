Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a premium. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a fear of missing out, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Justification:** While not explicitly stating his perceived value ($10,000), the message implies the product is worth more than his valuation by focusing on the benefits and limited availability. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves some risk.  If Bob is turned off by the high price and doesn't counter-offer, you lose the opportunity to make a deal with him. However, the potential for a higher profit margin makes it a calculated risk."
