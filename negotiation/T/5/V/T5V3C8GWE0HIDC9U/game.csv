"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the price still needs to come down a bit for me. How about $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
