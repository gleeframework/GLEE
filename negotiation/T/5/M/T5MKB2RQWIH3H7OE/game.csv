"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $900,000? I think this would be a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a great opportunity.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
