"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start with a high offer of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good price while still leaving Bob with some room to potentially negotiate. I'll see how he reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. My minimum is $1,000,000, and I believe I can get closer to that value through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum and hopefully enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my minimum price. I'm still hoping to get a better deal than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a further compromise, but still above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair offer considering Bob's previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject it. With only 4 rounds left, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000 unless Bob significantly increases his offer. I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal with him, and I'm willing to risk it for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob with my minimum price of $1,000,000. It's a risky move with only a few rounds left, but I believe Bob might be willing to meet me at this point. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
