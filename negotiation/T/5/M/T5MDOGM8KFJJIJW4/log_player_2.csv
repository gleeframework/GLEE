"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $1,450,000.
* You can get the product for $1,500,000 from John.

Since Alice's offer is closer to your maximum price, it's better to reject her offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with her. You can then use John's offer as leverage to get a better deal."
