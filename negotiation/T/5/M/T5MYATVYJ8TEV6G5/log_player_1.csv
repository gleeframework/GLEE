"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, leaving room for negotiation but still securing a significant profit for myself.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to make Bob feel valued and inclined to negotiate.
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for both of us, emphasizing that it's a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within $15,000. Would you be able to lower the price to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm confident I can still get a better deal with Bob.
* **Potential counteroffers:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I open the door for further negotiations and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $14,000.
* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John for $10,000 would be a significant loss for me. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price slightly, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair price:** $13,500 is still a profitable price for me, while offering Bob a good deal. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a friendly atmosphere."
