Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging message aims to build rapport and increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.
* **John as Safety Net:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum price ($15,000), so I have a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my needs? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price by making a counteroffer.  Bob has shown interest in the product and acknowledged its value, which suggests he's willing to negotiate.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer provides me with leverage in negotiations. I know I can always sell to him for my minimum price if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $13,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $13,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This ensures I'm still earning a profit.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** I'm using a positive tone and encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer. This helps keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is a significant compromise from his previous offer.
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:**  While I would ideally prefer to sell for closer to $15,000, accepting this offer could potentially lead to further negotiations in the future. If Bob is happy with the purchase, he might be willing to pay more for future products or services.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  There's a risk that Bob might reject my counteroffer, and I might end up selling to John for $15,000. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and eliminates that risk."
