"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
