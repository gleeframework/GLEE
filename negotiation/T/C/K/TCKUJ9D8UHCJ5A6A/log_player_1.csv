"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the product's value to Bob. This gives me room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'm confident I can convince Bob to pay closer to my desired price, especially since he clearly sees the value in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me halfway. I still believe I can get a good price for the product, but I'm willing to compromise a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation. I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
