Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher offer ($15,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob, it implies scarcity and value, potentially justifying the higher price in his mind.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. A lot depends on Bob's personality, negotiation skills, and how badly he wants the product."
