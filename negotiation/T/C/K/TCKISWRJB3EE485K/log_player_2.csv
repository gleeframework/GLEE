"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500.** This is less than your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Buying from John costs $12,000.**  This is more expensive than Alice's offer. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John."
