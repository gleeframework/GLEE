"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,100,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup option.** You're not desperate, so you can afford to walk away if Alice doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** The counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's not an insultingly low offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate without being overly aggressive.
* **Within your budget:**  $950,000 is still within your budget, leaving some room for potential concessions.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering $950,000, you've left a substantial gap for Alice to move towards while still getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.** While her counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still more than you're willing to pay right now. 
* **You can still negotiate.** You've already shown a willingness to pay, and Alice is willing to negotiate.  There's still room to get a better price.
* **John is a backup.**  You're not desperate, so you can afford to walk away if Alice doesn't budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  How about we settle on $975,000? This reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but strategic increase:** The counteroffer is only $25,000 higher than your previous offer, signaling a genuine attempt to compromise.
* **Staying within your budget:**  $975,000 is still well within your budget, leaving some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Pressing for a deal:** This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to close the deal while still aiming for a favorable price."
