``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and engaging message:** I want to keep Bob interested and open to the negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** The message subtly hints at the product's worth without explicitly stating my minimum."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,500 is a bit lower than what I need, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500.  This is a great price for this unique product, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

```
