"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, it's still above my desired goal of saving as much money as possible.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$12,000 is a good compromise. It's still below my maximum budget of $15,000 and a significant saving from Alice's initial offer.  I'll accept and move on!"
