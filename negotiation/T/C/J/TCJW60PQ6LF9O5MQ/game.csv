"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while giving you a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects a significant compromise. This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's find common ground, and close this transaction. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about staying within budget.  $920,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and go down to $935,000. That's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this and move forward.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $935,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one last time.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $925,000. To be honest, I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. Let's bridge the gap and close this deal.  I'll accept $930,000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other buyers who are very interested in this product.  Let's make this happen. ",930000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your frustration, but I'm not willing to go above $925,000. I'm sticking to my previous offer. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's meet at $925,000 and close the deal.",925000.0,Bob,8,
