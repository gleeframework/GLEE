"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential for you, I propose a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, you can still save money by rejecting her offer.  You can then use the threat of buying from John to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
