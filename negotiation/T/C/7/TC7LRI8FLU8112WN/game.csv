"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  It's something I've personally valued at no less than $8,000.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  This gives you a significant savings compared to its true value, and it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
