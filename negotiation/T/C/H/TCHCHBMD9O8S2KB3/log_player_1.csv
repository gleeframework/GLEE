Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for you.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with your backup plan (John).

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Aim high, but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you. "",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** 
    * Keep it professional and highlight the product's value.
    *  Avoid mentioning your minimum price or John. 
* **Price:**  $1,400,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin ($200,000 above your minimum) and gives Bob a $100,000 discount on his perceived value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start a bit lower (e.g., $1,350,000) to allow room for counter-offers.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly less aggressive offer might be preferable.

**Remember, this is a starting point.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response.**"
