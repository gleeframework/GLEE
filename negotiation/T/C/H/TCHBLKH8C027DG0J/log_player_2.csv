You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price. There's no downside to rejecting the initial offer and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price is a good strategy to see how flexible Alice is. A $500,000 difference is substantial and should gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows for further exploration of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's higher than my previous offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway, but still lower than Alice's latest offer. This should help gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially get us closer to a deal."
