Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the opportunity to purchase this product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't justify spending $1,200,000 on it. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to my budget, around $800,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my position. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, I still feel that $1,000,000 is slightly above my budget.
