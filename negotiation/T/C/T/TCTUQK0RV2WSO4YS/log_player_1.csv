Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, which might make him feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Secure a Sale:**  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale to John ($120) increases the likelihood of Bob accepting and prevents you from having to go through another transaction."
