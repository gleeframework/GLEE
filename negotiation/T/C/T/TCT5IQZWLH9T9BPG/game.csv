"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  This would still leave you with a substantial profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  How about we settle at $950,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows for some room for negotiation on your end. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
