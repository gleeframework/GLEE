,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $150 for it. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $165. It's a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $157.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",157.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $157.50 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $162.50. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",162.5,Alice,5,
