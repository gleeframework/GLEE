"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price is a little steep for me. How about we bring it down to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This recognizes the significant value it offers you while still reflecting a fair deal for me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you consider $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
