"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. I know it's worth a lot more to you, and this price allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, you can do better. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and you have a backup option with John at that price.  There's room to negotiate with Alice."
