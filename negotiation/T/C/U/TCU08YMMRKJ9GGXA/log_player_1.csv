"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 2300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a significantly higher price than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be worth even more.
* **Confidence:**  A strong opening offer demonstrates your belief in the product's value. 
* **Anchoring:** By setting a high initial price, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a point favorable to you. Even if Bob rejects it, his counteroffers are likely to be closer to your initial price than if you started lower.
* **Walk Away Option:** You always have John as a backup, which allows you to confidently negotiate for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, the price you've offered is a bit steep for me. Given the market value and my budget, I'm willing to offer $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above your minimum, but significantly below your initial ask.  This indicates room for negotiation. By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to negotiate but not at a low price. You still have time and the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. It's a unique opportunity with the potential for substantial returns. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This still reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 2100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Stand Firm:** You're lowering your price to show a willingness to negotiate, but the decrease is substantial enough to indicate you're serious about a higher value.
* **Reaffirm Value:** By reiterating the product's unique qualities and potential returns, you aim to justify the higher price in Bob's mind. 
* **Maintain Advantage:** You are still significantly above both your minimum and Bob's offer, maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe $2,100,000 is too high.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $1,900,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my end and would allow us to both walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,900,000 is a significant profit above your minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob is clearly motivated and has made a substantial jump from his previous offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could push for more, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
