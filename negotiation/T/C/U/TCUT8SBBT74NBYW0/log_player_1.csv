"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
 
Let me know what Bob says! I'm aiming high initially to see if there's room to negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob's offer matches my minimum price, I can get the same amount from John without further negotiation. Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in future rounds."
