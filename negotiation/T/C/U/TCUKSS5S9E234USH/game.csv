"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but only if it's within a more reasonable range.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $6,000 is a bit low for my expectations. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12,000. It's a fair price that I think reflects the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be open to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, $8,000 is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go.",10000.0,Alice,5,
