# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal, he can potentially get a better price. He has a maximum budget of $15,000, so there's room to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, he can try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a significant drop from her original price of $12,000. This is a good deal for Bob. While he might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling through increases with each counteroffer. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without the risk of going over his budget."
