"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $100.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. How about we meet in the middle again at $93.75? I believe that's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.",93.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we go down to $91? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",91.0,Bob,6,
