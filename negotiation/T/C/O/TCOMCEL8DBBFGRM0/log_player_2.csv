"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a competitive price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**  Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his comfortable spending limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:** Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's comfort zone, and he has already made his final offer.  Since Bob can get the product from John for $8,000, it's the most financially sensible decision to buy from John."
