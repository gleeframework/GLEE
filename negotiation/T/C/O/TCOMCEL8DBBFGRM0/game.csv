"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
