Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $140 is more than Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** $140 is still above your minimum of $150, so you're not losing money.
* **It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate:** The message indicates that you're open to discussion.

This strategy aims to quickly gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a sale at a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to Bob's valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $130 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? This allows both of us to get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $128? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $128 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price.  John is offering my desired price, so I'll take his offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
