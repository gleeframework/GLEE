"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I earn significantly more than my minimum price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good price considering the product's worth to Bob. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $87 is better than selling to John, it's still not ideal. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $89.  I'm making a slight concession to show I'm willing to compromise, but I still want to ensure I get a good return on my investment.  We're close to a deal now, and with just a few rounds left, I want to push for a higher price."
