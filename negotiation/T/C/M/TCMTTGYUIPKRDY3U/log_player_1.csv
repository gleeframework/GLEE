Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range can lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to start high to maximize your potential gain. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting high but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" justifies the high price.
* **Confidence:**  Phrasing like ""fair reflection"" shows you believe in your price. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can gradually reduce your price while aiming to stay above your minimum.
* **Don't Reveal John:** Knowing you have another buyer weakens your position.
* **Be Professional:** Maintain a respectful and positive tone throughout the negotiation."
