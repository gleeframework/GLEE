"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems a bit high to me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, however,  $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $2,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be fair to the product's value.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,500,000?  That seems like a fair price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
