Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, however,  $900,000 is still considerably below my bottom line.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

We are still in a good negotiating position. Bob is clearly interested and moving closer to our desired price range. We're not at a point where accepting John's offer makes more sense. Let's keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $950,000 is still too low for me to accept. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,025,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

This is a good point to accept.  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has significantly increased his offer.  While we might be able to squeeze a little more out of the deal, accepting $1,025,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
