"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, however,  $900,000 is still considerably below my bottom line.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,100,000 more accurately reflects that. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable figure around this point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair middle ground, considering the value you're offering.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $950,000 is still too low for me to accept. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,025,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value you're offering.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
