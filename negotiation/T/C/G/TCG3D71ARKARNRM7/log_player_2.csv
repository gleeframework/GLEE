Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save as much as possible, but I have to prioritize my own interests as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer.  At $1,050,000, I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
