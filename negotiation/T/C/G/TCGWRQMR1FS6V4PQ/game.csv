"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to your operations.  While I'm confident in its worth, I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000. This represents a significant saving for you, given its estimated value to your company.  Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset at a price that's  advantageous for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
