"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for it. I believe it's a good price considering the product's worth to me is no more than $8,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is no more than $8,000.",9000.0,Bob,4,
