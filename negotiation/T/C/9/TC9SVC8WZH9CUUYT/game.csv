"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  It's a great deal for you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $120 is a fair price for the product. Can you meet me halfway at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $127.50? This is a fair compromise and allows us to both get what we want.",127.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with $127.50, but I'm willing to meet you at $125. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80",125.0,Bob,6,
