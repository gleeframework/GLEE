"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay a bit closer to my desired price point.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  That's still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value, and it allows me to get closer to my target.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $880,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",880000.0,Bob,4,
