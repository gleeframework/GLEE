Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay a bit closer to my desired price point.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  That's still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value, and it allows me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $880,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
