Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's quality and features. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $1,050,000 secures a good deal for me while avoiding the risk of her withdrawing from the negotiation entirely."
