"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before going with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $13,500 is still above his budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down closer to his price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is a bit closer to your budget. I think this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make this concession to get the deal done.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice's offer is lower than her previous ones, it's still above Bob's budget of $10,000.  At this point, it's clear Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and Bob is better off buying the product from John for his target price."
