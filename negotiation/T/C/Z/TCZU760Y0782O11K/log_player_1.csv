{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $11,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but is still below my minimum. This creates room for negotiation and gives me some margin to potentially lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,500? This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the fact that I could easily sell it to someone else for a higher price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $10,250 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and a better deal than selling to John.  I'm willing to accept this offer to finalize the deal."
