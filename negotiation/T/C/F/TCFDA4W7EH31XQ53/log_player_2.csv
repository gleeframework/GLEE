"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can likely get a better deal than $1,400,000. Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It's also a fair price considering Alice's value of $1,000,000, leaving room for both parties to gain something.  This offer gives Alice a good incentive to accept while still leaving Bob room to potentially negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves Alice with a profit.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and leaving him with no option but to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good price for Bob and a successful negotiation."
