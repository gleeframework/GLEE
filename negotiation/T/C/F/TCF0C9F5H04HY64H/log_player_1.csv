{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique piece that I believe is worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially earn more.
* **Value proposition:** I highlight the product's uniqueness and potential value to entice Bob.
* **Negotiation signal:** I explicitly state my willingness to negotiate, showing flexibility and openness to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am only able to offer $15000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to settle for the lowest possible amount. I believe there's potential for a higher price, especially since Bob acknowledges the product's uniqueness. By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $15,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $17,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's unique qualities.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $20,000 to $17,500. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the unique qualities of the product to reinforce its worth. 
* **Finding a middle ground:**  I suggest finding a compromise to signal a desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with $16000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Final offer:** Bob explicitly stated this is his final offer, indicating that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  Selling to John would only net me $15,000, while accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a higher price.

Since the potential gain from further negotiation is small, and there's a risk of ending up with a lower price by selling to John, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option at this point."
