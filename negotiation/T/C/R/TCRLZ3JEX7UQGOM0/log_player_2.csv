"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part, while still reflecting the value this product brings.

You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here. While I'm still convinced the product's value is significantly higher, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the potential this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

**Reasoning:** Alice is very unlikely to come down to a price that makes sense for you.  She started extremely high and is moving very slowly. It's clear she's trying to hold out for a much higher price than your limit. You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, which is a much better deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
