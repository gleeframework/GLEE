"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're happy with it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to make this work a little better on my end.  How about $11,000? That's a significant price for me, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase today if you agree.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $13,500. It's still a good price for you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go.",13500.0,Alice,5,
