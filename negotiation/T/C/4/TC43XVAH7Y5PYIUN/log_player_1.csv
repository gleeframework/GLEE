Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that holds immense value. While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I assure you it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant investment, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's potential.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum budget. I'm eager to learn more about the product, but this price is my absolute limit. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a substantial amount, it's below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your financial constraints.  While $800,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This price is still below its true worth but shows my willingness to compromise. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $900000. This reflects the value I see in the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's work towards an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If he rejects again, I'll sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and the limitations of your budget.  I'm willing to make one final compromise to see if we can reach a deal.  I'm offering the product for $1,000,000. This is my absolute minimum, as it reflects the product's true value to me.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but $1000000 is still outside my budget. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $950000, which is my absolute final offer. If you're open to it, we can finalize the transaction.  However, if this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum of $1,000,000.  While I could counteroffer again, I'm running out of time. I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000 by continuing to negotiate. Therefore, I'll sell to John."
