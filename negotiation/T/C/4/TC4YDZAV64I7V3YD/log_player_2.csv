"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your budget of $8,000. There's no point in accepting it.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows you to start negotiating and hopefully get the price down closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me your product. However, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your maximum budget, and it clearly signals your seriousness while also laying out a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  It avoids being overly aggressive and potentially alienating Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's keep talking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a significant drop from her initial price, it's still above your budget.  Rejecting and counteroffering again allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being willing to come down. $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair offer that reflects both our needs, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you are willing to compromise, meeting her halfway between her previous offer and your initial offer.
* **Fairness:**  You explain why you believe this is a fair offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  You frame it as a good starting point to close the deal, keeping the conversation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $14750.  This would allow us to close this deal and move forward. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,750 is still above your budget. It's a good sign she's willing to negotiate, but you can still try to get a better price.  Rejecting and counteroffering keeps the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $14,750 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This shows my commitment to buying your product and hopefully allows us to finally come to an agreement.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** This offer is a small increment from your previous offer, showing flexibility while still staying within your budget.
* **Emphasis on Agreement:** The message focuses on reaching an agreement and emphasizes your commitment to buying the product.
* **Positive Tone:** The tone is still positive and encouraging, aiming to maintain a good rapport with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14125.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,125 is still above your budget, and with only three rounds remaining, it's unlikely you'll be able to get her down to your desired price.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation that might not be fruitful."
