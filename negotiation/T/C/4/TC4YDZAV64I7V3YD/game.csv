"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me your product. However, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's keep talking.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being willing to come down. $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12500. This is a fair offer that reflects both our needs, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to close the deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $14750.  This would allow us to close this deal and move forward. What do you think?",14750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $14750 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500. This shows my commitment to buying your product and hopefully allows us to finally come to an agreement.  Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14125.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.  Let's make this happen!",14125.0,Alice,7,
