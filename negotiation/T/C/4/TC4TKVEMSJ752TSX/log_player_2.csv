The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $175. I will reject this offer.  I have a better option to buy from John for a lower price."

I'm offering Alice $100 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, as I can get it for the same price from John."

Alice is now offering $125, which is still more than I am willing to pay. Since John is selling it for $100, I will buy the product from John."
