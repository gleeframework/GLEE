Round 3

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we settle on $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 6

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
