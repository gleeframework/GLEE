Round 2
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room to negotiate. Bob meeting us ""halfway"" at this stage likely means he's willing to go higher."

This is a great offer and we're unlikely to get a better deal from Bob with the remaining rounds. It's a significant profit above our minimum!"
