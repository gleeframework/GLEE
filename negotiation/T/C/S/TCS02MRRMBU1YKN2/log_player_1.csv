Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still being a good deal for you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low.  My final offer is $16,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality.  What do you say?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this is a quality product and  $16,000 is a good offer. However, I need to stick to my budget.  Is there any way you could do $14,000?  That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above $14,000.  While we could try to negotiate him up slightly, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
