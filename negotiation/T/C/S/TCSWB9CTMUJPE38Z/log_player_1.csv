"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a little bit and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This reflects the value you've expressed and gives us a good starting point for a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is closer to my target, it's still not quite there.  I'm hoping one more counteroffer will get us to a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're close, but $950,000 doesn't quite cover what this product is worth to me. Let's compromise - I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $970,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $970,000 is close, I'm still holding out for a little bit more. I'm hoping one last counteroffer will convince Bob to go a bit higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both close to our desired prices. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product for $985,000. This is my final offer,  as I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 985000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make a deal.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I was hoping to get more from Bob, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and it seems unlikely we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with.  John's offer is a secure deal, and it's better than risking losing more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
