"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a little bit and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This reflects the value you've expressed and gives us a good starting point for a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand we're close, but $950,000 doesn't quite cover what this product is worth to me. Let's compromise - I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $970,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",970000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're both close to our desired prices. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product for $985,000. This is my final offer,  as I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",985000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make a deal.",980000.0,Bob,8,
