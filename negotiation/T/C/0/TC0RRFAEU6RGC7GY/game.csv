"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is tempting, it's a bit lower than I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference one last time? I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, which would be $9,500. Is there any way you could meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
