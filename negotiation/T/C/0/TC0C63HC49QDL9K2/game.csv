"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise. This is a high-quality product that will be worth much more to you in the long run. Let's see if we can make this happen.",10000.0,Alice,3,
