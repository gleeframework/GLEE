Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,100,000, I have space to go lower if Bob counteroffers, while still making a profit.
* **Plan B:** I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my price. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the possibility of a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. I am willing to pay $1050000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price of $1,200,000, and even below my initial offer of $1,100,000.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's room for a higher offer from Bob.  
* **Strong Alternative:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:** I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000,  which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price that's in between Bob's offer and my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing that I want to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Still Profitable:**  This price is still above Bob's perceived value and allows me to earn a significant profit.
* **Pressure to Negotiate:**  By lowering my price slightly, I'm putting a little pressure on Bob to come up in his offer.

This strategy allows me to continue negotiating with Bob while keeping my profit margin in mind, and I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I would like to propose $1070000 as the price for your product. This allows us to stay within my budget while also being fair to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:** Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is only $10,000 below my desired price of $1,080,000.
* **Minimizing Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a lower price, and there's a risk that he'll reject my counteroffer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a significant profit. While I'd prefer $1,080,000, $1,070,000 is a solid outcome.

**Next Steps:** I'm happy to accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale."
