"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $11,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this offer reflects a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering. 

There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. Bob can try to secure a price closer to that value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired selling price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is quite significant, and $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Cost:** Alice's offer of $10,250 is still significantly lower than John's $12,000, meaning Bob can save a considerable amount of money.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has already moved from her initial $11,000 offer.  It's likely further negotiation will result in a smaller price reduction.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While a slightly better price might be possible, the risk of further negotiation failing and needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential benefit.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $10,250 is the most sensible choice for Bob, balancing cost savings with the possibility of losing the deal."
