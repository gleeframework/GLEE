"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $119. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $119 is close to your maximum budget, you can still try to get a better price. Rejecting her offer might lead to a counter-offer, and if not, you can always buy from John for $120."
