Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price before going to John."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. Even though her offer is closer to my budget, it's still above what I initially wanted to spend.  It's more cost-effective to buy from John at this point."
