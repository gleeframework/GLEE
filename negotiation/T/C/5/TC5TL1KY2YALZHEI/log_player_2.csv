# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a limited time. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth $15,000 to you, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
