Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $1,400,000 is higher than Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, but not so high that he'll immediately reject it.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  It allows for a back and forth, potentially leading to a price both parties are happy with.

Remember, it's a delicate balance. You want to maximize your profit, but also keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
