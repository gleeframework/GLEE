"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,100,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To demonstrate my own flexibility, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while still working within your budget.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $975,000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $962,500. I think this is a fair price that recognizes the product's value without breaking the bank.",962500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference one last time? Let's say $968,750, and we have a deal.",968750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $968,750. I'm willing to meet you at $955,000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can agree on this price.",955000.0,Bob,8,
