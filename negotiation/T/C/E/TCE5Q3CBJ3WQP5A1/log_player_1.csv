I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's a decent markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to sell to John for $10,000, but I'd prefer to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's lowball offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 less than my ideal counteroffer of $12,000. It's a reasonable price considering the back and forth. It's also better than the $10,000 I'd get from John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
