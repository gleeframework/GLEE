"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is decent, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000.  There's a chance you could get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she's willing to go lower."
