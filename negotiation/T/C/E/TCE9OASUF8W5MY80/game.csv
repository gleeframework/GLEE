"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I know it's worth even more to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,250,000.  This price reflects a significant discount and allows for a substantial profit for you. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to buy the product for $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise to close this deal. Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer the product for $1,050,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it ensures I get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget right now. Would you consider $975,000? I'm eager to finalize this and think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
