"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This takes into account my budget and ensures I'm getting a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This price still reflects the product's true value to you, but it's a more reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
