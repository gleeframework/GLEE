"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true worth. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,250,000. This is a fair price that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
