``` 

This offer allows for a decent profit for me while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob if he wants to counteroffer.  I'm confident he'll find the product valuable enough to consider it, but if not, I'm always happy to sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $13,000?  That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price range, and it's a good deal for me considering the potential of further negotiations.  I'm happy to accept this offer."
