"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. He has 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $95.
* **Potential Savings:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are only $5.  
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If Bob rejects this offer and continues to negotiate, he risks Alice getting frustrated and walking away, forcing him to buy from John for $120.

Considering the risk of losing the deal and the small potential for further savings, accepting Alice's offer at $95 is the most prudent decision."
