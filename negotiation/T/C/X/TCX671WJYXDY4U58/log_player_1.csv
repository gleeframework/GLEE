"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but is still lower than the product's worth to Bob.  This encourages Bob to consider the offer while still giving me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than my minimum, it's still a bit low. I'll counter with a lower price, but not too much lower. I want to keep the negotiations moving towards a price that's closer to the product's worth to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
