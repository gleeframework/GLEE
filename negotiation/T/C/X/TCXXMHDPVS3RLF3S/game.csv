"I'm not getting any younger, and I'd rather not go back and forth forever. I'm willing to meet you at $108 again, just like in round 5. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options.",108.0,Alice,9,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one final offer of $105. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to explore other options, including buying from John.",105.0,Bob,10,
