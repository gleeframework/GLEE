Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly mention why the product is worth $10,000, it implies value by using phrases like ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment."" 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $8,000 from John. This knowledge empowers her to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. However, she shouldn't go below $8,000 since that's her guaranteed selling price to John."
