{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a fair starting point:** You're not being overly aggressive, but you're also not giving away too much value.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I want to try to get closer to my desired price of $11,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer with something closer to my original price, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 10000}
