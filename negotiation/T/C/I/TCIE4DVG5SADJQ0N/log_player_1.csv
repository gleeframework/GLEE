"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. Bob is likely to counter, and it gives you the opportunity to see how interested he really is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum but still a bit too low. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, hoping to meet halfway. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and selling to John would net me less.  It's time to close the deal."
