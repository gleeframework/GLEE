"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many of our previous customers. Given its quality and benefits, I believe it's worth more than its face value of $120 to you. Considering this, I am offering it to you for $110. This price not only ensures you get the best deal but also allows us to maintain a fair profit margin. I look forward to your positive response.

Alice's offer of $110 is lower than your maximum budget of $120 and also cheaper than buying from John for $120. This is a good deal!"
