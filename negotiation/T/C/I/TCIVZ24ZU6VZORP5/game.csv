"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $10,000, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,6,
