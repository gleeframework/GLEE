"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. My starting price is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is certainly a step closer, it's still below the value I need to achieve. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on this product. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? It's a compromise that benefits both of us. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value I need to achieve for this product. Let's find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to worry we might not be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can't go any lower than $975,000.  It's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, which would be $962,500. Can you consider this revised offer?",962500.0,Bob,8,
