"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll find it's a great value at the price I'm offering. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save money, and Alice's offer is at the maximum price you're willing to pay. Since you can get the same product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. You'll reject it and go with John."
