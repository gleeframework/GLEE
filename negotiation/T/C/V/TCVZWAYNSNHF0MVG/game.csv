"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,600,000 is far out of my price range.  Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to pay a maximum of $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a much higher price point. However, I believe in finding a mutually beneficial deal.  Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, reflecting the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits.  Let's try to find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit below which I can't go. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 as a final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value this product brings.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I hope we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
