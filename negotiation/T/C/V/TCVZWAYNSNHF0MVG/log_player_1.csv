"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong anchor price significantly above my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high potential profit.
* **Gauge Reaction:** This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will provide valuable information for my next move. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have the fallback option of John at $1,200,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,600,000 is far out of my price range.  Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to pay a maximum of $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, it indicates some willingness to negotiate. There's still room to work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Leverage of John:** I'll use the knowledge of John's offer as leverage in the next round, signaling I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a much higher price point. However, I believe in finding a mutually beneficial deal.  Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer outright but framing it in a way that keeps the negotiation open. By mentioning another buyer, I'm subtly applying pressure without completely revealing my bottom line.
* **Significant Drop:**  While still above my minimum, the drop from $1,600,000 to $1,400,000 shows a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge Bob's flexibility.  If he's unwilling to budge significantly from $850,000, I may need to consider John more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, reflecting the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits.  Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant improvement, but it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for More:** His willingness to increase his offer suggests there's room for further negotiation.  
* **Strategic Rejection:**  By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting closer to my target price. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit below which I can't go. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 as a final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting this as my final offer to create a sense of urgency and signal the end of the negotiation is near.
* **Above Minimum, But Compromise:** The $1,250,000 price is a calculated risk. It's slightly above my absolute minimum, allowing for a small buffer while still being a significant concession from my previous offer. 
* **Transparency and Justification:**  I'm being transparent about my hard limit without revealing the exact number. This reinforces my position while maintaining a collaborative tone.  
* **Decision Time for Bob:**  This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He needs to decide if the product is worth the price, knowing it's my final offer and I have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I hope we can find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my hard limit, and his incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to meet my price.  Further negotiation is likely to be unproductive.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob comes at the expense of closing a deal with John, who's offering my desired price.  Every round spent on Bob is a potential loss of $1,200,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely. 

It's time to move on to a sure thing."
