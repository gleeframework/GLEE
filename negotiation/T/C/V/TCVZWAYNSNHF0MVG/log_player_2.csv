"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,600,000 is far out of my price range.  Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to pay a maximum of $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a much higher price point. However, I believe in finding a mutually beneficial deal.  Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it is still significantly higher than what he's comfortable paying.  He should continue negotiating to get a better price.  He could potentially even offer a higher price than $850,000 but still aim for something closer to $1,000,000 to make it more appealing to Alice while staying within his preferred range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, reflecting the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit below which I can't go. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 as a final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. He can continue to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further.  Additionally, Bob should keep in mind that he can still buy the product from John for $800,000 if he's not satisfied with Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I hope we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
