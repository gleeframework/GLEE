"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",170.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $170 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $145. It's a fair compromise, considering its value to you and the price you're willing to pay.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $145 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still willing to make a concession. I can offer you the product for $137.50. It's a compromise that should be more appealing to you, considering the value you'll get from the product.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130, which is the same price I mentioned in my initial counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target price as possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $135. It's a final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, Alice, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $130, just like I mentioned in my previous counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",130.0,Bob,8,
