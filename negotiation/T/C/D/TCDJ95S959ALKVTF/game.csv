"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $13,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - I can do $14,200. What do you think?",14200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,200 is still a little high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my budget maxes out at $13,500.  Let's meet in the middle at that price and seal the deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500, but I can meet you halfway between $14,200 and $13,500. I'll do $13,800. That's the best I can do.",13800.0,Alice,5,
