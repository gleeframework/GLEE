"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our conversation.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $925,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a number that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product, and I believe it's a good compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can do better. I'll counteroffer at $912,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $912,500 is still a little more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product, and I think we're getting close to a deal. Let's see if we can bridge the remaining gap.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $907,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",907500.0,Alice,7,
