""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth a million dollars.  I'm willing to make this transaction smooth and efficient, so I'm proposing a price of $1,999,999. Let me know your decision quickly, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1999999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This means there's room to negotiate significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with an extremely high price ($1,999,999), you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. While this price is unlikely to be accepted, it sets the stage for a potentially much higher final price than if you started near $1,000,000.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, prompting Bob to act quickly and potentially be more flexible with his budget.

**Important Note:**  This strategy is aggressive. There's a chance Bob might be completely turned off by the initial high price. However, given the potential profit and your fallback option (selling to John), it's a calculated risk that could yield a significantly higher return."
