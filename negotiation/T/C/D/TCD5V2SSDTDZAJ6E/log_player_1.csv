"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. How about $8,500? That gives you a good profit and still saves me some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $8,500 is a good deal for him, it's not the best for me.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $9,500."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $8,750. That's a good price for both of us and lets us close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $8,750 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my desired profit.  I don't want to risk losing the sale by being too stubborn."
