"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you and a good return for me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is still above your target of $8,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. How about $8,500? That gives you a good profit and still saves me some money."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $9,000 is still a bit more than you're willing to pay.  You're still confident you can negotiate a better price.  There are still 7 rounds remaining, so it's worth continuing to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $8,750. That's a good price for both of us and lets us close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
