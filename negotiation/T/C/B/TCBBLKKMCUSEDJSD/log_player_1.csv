Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with its value to me. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to sell to him, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is tempting, it's unfortunately below my minimum price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,500. This gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
