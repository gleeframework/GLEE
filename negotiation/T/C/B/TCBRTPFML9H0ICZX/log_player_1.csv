Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is worth a shot. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still leaving me with a profit above his perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows for some back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate further. 

I am essentially aiming to capture as much of the difference between Bob's perceived value ($12,000) and my guaranteed sale price ($15,000) as possible."
