"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. To show my genuine interest, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While your offer is tempting, I believe it undervalues its true potential.  Let's meet closer to the middle - how about $1,325,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,325,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  While it's closer to the middle ground, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price.  He has time, and there's still room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your perspective on the product's value, but  $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
