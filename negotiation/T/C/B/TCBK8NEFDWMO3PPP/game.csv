"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for something worth at least $10,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,750 still isn't quite what I'm looking for.  How about $8,900?  It's a compromise that gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my minimum.  Let's close this deal!",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go to $8,750, but I'd really love to get it for $8,500. Can you meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for $8,500, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about we split the difference at $8,625? This is a great deal for both of us.  I'm willing to close this deal right now at this price.",8625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $8,600, but I'd really love to get it for $8,500. Can you meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,8,
