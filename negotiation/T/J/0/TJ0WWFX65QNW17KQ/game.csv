"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $1,200,000 is the highest I can go. If you're unable to meet that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is your maximum offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is the closest I can get to your offer without sacrificing my own interests.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
