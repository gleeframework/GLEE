Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He'd ideally want to pay less, but anything significantly over this is a loss for him.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,000,001 (just above Bob's value) and $1,499,999 (just below your guaranteed amount).

**Strategy:**

You want to start high but leave room for negotiation to make Bob feel like he's getting a deal. 

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for such a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,400,000 gives you significant room for negotiation while still staying within a reasonable range above Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident Tone:**  The language implies the product's value and positions you as doing Bob a favor by offering it to him first.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's thoughts, you signal willingness to negotiate.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to counter-offer if needed, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyers:** Having John as a backup strengthens your position. If Bob is too difficult or unwilling to meet a reasonable price, you can confidently walk away knowing you have a guaranteed sale."
