"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was hoping to spend closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the benefits this product will bring you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However,  $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $7,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand where you're coming from, but to be honest, $7,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make my final offer at $9,500. This is a significant discount and reflects my desire to find a solution that works for us both.  Let me know your thoughts.",9500.0,Alice,5,
