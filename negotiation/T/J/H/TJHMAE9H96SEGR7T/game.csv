"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's truly a unique opportunity, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. With that said, I'm willing to make a starting offer of $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $900000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
