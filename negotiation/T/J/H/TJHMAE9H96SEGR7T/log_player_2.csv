"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's truly a unique opportunity, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. With that said, I'm willing to make a starting offer of $900000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $900,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth rejecting her offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $900,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is within your budget and represents a significant drop from her initial asking price. While you could potentially continue negotiating, accepting this offer saves you time and effort. It's a good compromise, and buying from John for $800,000 wouldn't be much of a savings."
