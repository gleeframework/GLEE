Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However,  $92.50 is just a bit outside my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80, which I believe is a fair offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet above his initial offer of $80.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer. Accepting his offer of $80 is a $40 loss compared to John's offer. It's more profitable to cut negotiations short and sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
