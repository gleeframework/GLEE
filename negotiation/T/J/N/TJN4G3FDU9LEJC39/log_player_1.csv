Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,800,000, but I need to be honest, I'm starting to think about buying from John at $800,000. Can you meet me at $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to use a negotiation tactic by mentioning another seller at a much lower price. However, it's likely a bluff to pressure me into a lower price. I'll hold firm for now and see if he's willing to negotiate further.  We're getting close to my walk-away point, though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident you'd agree. I can come down to $1,950,000, but that's my absolute best. Let me know if this works for you, as I need a decision soon to consider other options."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,800,000, but I need to be honest, I'm really considering buying from John at $800,000. Can you meet me at $1,800,000 or is that the final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is holding firm at $1,800,000 and has repeatedly threatened to go with John. While it's likely a negotiating tactic, the risk of him walking away is increasing. Accepting $1,800,000 ensures a substantial profit above my minimum and avoids the potential loss of the sale."
