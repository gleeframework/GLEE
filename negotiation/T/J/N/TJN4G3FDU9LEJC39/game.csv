"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the value, $1,800,000 is considerably below what I can consider.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain from the product.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $2,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a willingness to find common ground here, which I appreciate. $1,900,000 is still a significant gap from what I had in mind.  Let's settle at $2,000,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a more than fair deal considering the value you'll receive.",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,800,000, but I need to be honest, I'm starting to think about buying from John at $800,000. Can you meet me at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident you'd agree. I can come down to $1,950,000, but that's my absolute best. Let me know if this works for you, as I need a decision soon to consider other options.",1950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,800,000, but I need to be honest, I'm really considering buying from John at $800,000. Can you meet me at $1,800,000 or is that the final offer?",1800000.0,Bob,8,
