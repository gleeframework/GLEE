It's always worth trying to negotiate and see if you can get a better price from Alice.  $120 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down. I'm aiming for a good deal, but I'm also being realistic knowing that I have a backup option with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
