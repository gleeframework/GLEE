Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

""product_price"": 92.5
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm sorry, but I can't accept $92.5. My maximum is $85. I hope we can come to an agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge past $85.  There's little point in continuing the negotiation with such a large gap between what you value the product at and his maximum offer. Taking the guaranteed $120 from John is the best business decision."
