"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach your target, but I'm not willing to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $1,090,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
