Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $775,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $795,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still only one round away from selling to John for $800,000. I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better deal with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to explore other options. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're down to the last few rounds and Bob isn't budging much.  While $795,000 is a decent price, I'd rather take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
