"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $120 right now. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $200 is already a steal for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can be a good customer.",140.0,Bob,4,
