,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. How about we try to get closer to the middle at $12,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12250.0,Bob,4,
