"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $8,500.  This price still reflects the product's value, but it also allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
