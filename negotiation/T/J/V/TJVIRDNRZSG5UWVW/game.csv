"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair value given the product's potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
