"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,300,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000, but I was really hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not comfortable going below $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,220,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle now.",1220000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,160,000? ",1160000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,160,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,180,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1180000.0,Alice,7,
