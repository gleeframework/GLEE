Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm not eager to lose the sale, $100 is my absolute minimum and doesn't reflect the product's value. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to accept.  If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $10 less than my initial counteroffer, and  it's getting closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to take the $110 to avoid the risk of further negotiation and a potential loss of the sale."
