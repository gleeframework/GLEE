{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so any offer to Bob should be significantly higher.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) might make him balk. Offering a price around $1,300,000 leaves a good profit margin for you while still being attractive to Bob.

This offer attempts to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring Bob sees the offer as a good deal."
