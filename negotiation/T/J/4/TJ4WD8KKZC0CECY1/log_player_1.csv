Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 14999 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to maximize our profit. Starting with an offer just below our guaranteed sale price to John ($15,000) aims for the highest possible gain.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The high initial offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving us the chance to slightly lower the price while still securing a profit significantly higher than what Bob initially perceived as valuable. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We have a safety net. If Bob rejects our offer, we can confidently sell to John at our minimum acceptable price."
