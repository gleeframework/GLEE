I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm hoping to get more.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm splitting the difference between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

Bob's offer is a good compromise.  It's higher than what John is offering, and I'm happy to close the deal at $16,000."
