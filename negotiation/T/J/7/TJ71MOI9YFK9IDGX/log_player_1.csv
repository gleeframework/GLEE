Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 (because John will buy it at that price). 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering the product at $119 gives Bob a chance to get it for a price he might consider reasonable (below his valuation), while still netting you a profit.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject this offer. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially earn an extra $19 compared to selling directly to John."
