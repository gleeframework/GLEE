Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a significant profit margin for Alice ($500,000 over her minimum) while still offering Bob a substantial discount ($500,000 less than his perceived value). 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This offer assumes Alice doesn't know the exact value of the product to Bob. If she knew it was worth $800,000 to him, she could potentially negotiate a higher price, but still below his perceived value."
