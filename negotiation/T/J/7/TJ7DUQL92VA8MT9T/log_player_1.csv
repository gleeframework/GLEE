Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Attractive Offer:** $130 is a good price for Bob, as he gets a discount on the perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message conveys a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Backup Plan:** I can always sell to John for $150 if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I can try to negotiate a higher price.
* **Strong backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which gives me leverage in negotiations. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing a fair price for both of us, to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message remains open to further negotiation,  encouraging Bob to counter again if necessary.

By offering a compromise, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still trying to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel like $100 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would $110 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Even though Bob has increased his offer to $110, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be successful:**  Bob is clearly focused on staying within his budget and might not be willing to increase his offer significantly. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome. 

Since I have a reliable alternative buyer in John, it's best to secure the sale to him and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might not result in a profitable deal."
