Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for profit, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is substantial, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to steer the price closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and reflects the true potential of this product."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm lowering my price by $200,000, but I'm still aiming high. This demonstrates flexibility while reinforcing the product's value. It's a strategic move to encourage Bob to meet me closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now getting closer to my acceptable range. However, $100,000 is still a significant difference, and I believe there's room for him to move further up.  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,950,000? This feels like a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm lowering my price by another $50,000, splitting the difference from the previous round. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also holds firm on a price point that's beneficial for me.  The emphasis on his potential return is a subtle nudge to consider the bigger picture."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range, and further haggling may not yield significantly better results. Accepting at $1,850,000 secures a significant profit compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
