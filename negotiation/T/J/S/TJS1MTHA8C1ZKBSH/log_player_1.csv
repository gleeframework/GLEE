"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of securing a higher price.
* **Value Unknown:** Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's best to start with a price that I believe is acceptable while leaving room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:** By observing Bob's response to my initial offer, I can get a better understanding of his perceived value of the product. 
* **Negotiate Strategically:**  Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my subsequent offers,  aiming to find a price that's acceptable to both of us.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** The fact that I have a backup buyer for $12,000 gives me leverage. If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can walk away and secure a guaranteed sale."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is still significantly lower than my initial asking price of $18,000.  
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** While $15,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** The fact that I have a backup buyer for $12,000 gives me leverage, allowing me to hold out for a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me, aiming to find a middle ground.
* **Assess Bob's Willingness:** By observing Bob's response to my counteroffer, I'll gain a better understanding of his true value for the product. 
* **Stay Flexible:** I'll remain flexible but firm, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the option of selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm offering $17,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $18,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $15,000. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This price is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, which ensures I make a profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:**  I'll pay close attention to Bob's reaction to this counteroffer to gauge his seriousness in purchasing the product.
* **Adapt My Approach:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll either continue negotiating or adjust my counteroffers to maximize my earnings. 
* **John is Still an Option:** I'll keep in mind that I can always sell the product to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Agreement:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my desired price range. It's only $1,000 away from my previous counteroffer.
* **Potential Loss:**  Rejecting this offer might lead to further back-and-forth negotiation, potentially wasting time and potentially resulting in a lower price. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** While selling to John guarantees $12,000, Bob's offer is a significant improvement.

**Strategy:**

* **Take the Win:**  I'm choosing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a good price.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While I might be able to squeeze out another $1,000, the potential for the negotiation to fall apart and leave me with only John's offer outweighs that potential gain."
