"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would give you a decent profit, and it fits within my budget.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your latest offer, $825,000 is still slightly out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $810,000. This would be a good deal for both of us - you'd still make a healthy profit, and I'd get a fair price. Let's close this deal.",810000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $810,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $815,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
