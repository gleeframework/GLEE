"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price to achieve the goal of saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $110. Would that be doable?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $110, which would be $117.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting very close to John's price, but there's still a chance to get the product for less than $120. It's worth making one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been great to work with.  How about we settle this right now at $115? It's a fair price and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. How about we meet in the middle again, at $118.25? It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's unlikely Alice will go below $118.  At this point, John's offer of $120 is the better deal to avoid further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse price from Alice."
