"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $110. Would that be doable?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $110, which would be $117.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",117.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been great to work with.  How about we settle this right now at $115? It's a fair price and we can both walk away happy.",115.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. How about we meet in the middle again, at $118.25? It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",118.25,Alice,7,
