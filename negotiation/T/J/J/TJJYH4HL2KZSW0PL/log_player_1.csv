Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **My minimum value:** I won't sell for less than $8,000 (John's offer). 
* **Negotiation room:**  Offering $12,000 gives Bob a $3,000 discount, making the deal attractive.
* **Potential risk:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but I'm still getting a $4,000 profit over my minimum.

This offer balances my desire to maximize profit with the risk of Bob's rejection."
