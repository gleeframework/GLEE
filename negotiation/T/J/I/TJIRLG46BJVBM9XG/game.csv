"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep, but $13,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,500. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase the product from John for $12,000 if we can't reach an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $16,000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final counteroffer, so please let me know if we have a deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
