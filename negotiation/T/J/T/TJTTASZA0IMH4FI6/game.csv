"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that provides immense value. I believe it's worth more than its face value of $80, but I understand everyone has their own valuation. Let's start with an offer of $120. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. However, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. While I would like to accommodate all potential buyers, I must consider the value I place on this product. I am unable to accept $80 for it. My counteroffer is $95. This price reflects the quality and uniqueness of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective. However, $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in between. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a compromise, I propose a price of $90. This offers a slight increase from my previous offer while still being within your budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can finalize the transaction.",90.0,Alice,5,
