{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price. Since Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate further. There's still a chance to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, the negotiation has gone back and forth a few times. Alice is clearly not willing to go much lower than $145.  Bob has already rejected a price of $142. It seems like Alice might not come down to Bob's ideal price. Since Bob's maximum budget is $150, it's now more advantageous to buy from John for $150 rather than risk getting a worse deal with Alice."
