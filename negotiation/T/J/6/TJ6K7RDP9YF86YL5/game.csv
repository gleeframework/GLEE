"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? I believe that's a fair deal considering the current market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product for $1,000,000. This price reflects the significant value this product can bring to your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $950,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with. I'm happy to continue negotiating but I need to stay within a certain range. How about $975,000?  This is a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
