"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think you'll find it really valuable. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer is far too low. I'll try to meet him closer to the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle and say $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could we do $100? That's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is a tough choice. Bob is at his maximum price, but I'm losing out on a potential $50 profit. 

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk getting less from Bob."
