"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $775,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $812,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",812500.0,Alice,5,
