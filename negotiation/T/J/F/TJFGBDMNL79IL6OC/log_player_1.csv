Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, giving you room to potentially negotiate further.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has incentive to accept.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
