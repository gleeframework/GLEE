I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?,15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $12000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10500. Would you be willing to accept that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going below $12000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $10750. This is as close as I can get to the price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're making a serious effort to reach a deal, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10750 and $12000, which would be $11375. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",11375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a final offer of $10900. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",10900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions already, and I'm not willing to go below $11500. However, I'm willing to make one last compromise. I can offer you a price of $11250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",11250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to pay above $10900, and you've made several concessions already. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm making a final offer of $10900. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to explore other options.",10900.0,Bob,10,
