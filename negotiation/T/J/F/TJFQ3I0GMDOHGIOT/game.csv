"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. To continue our negotiation, I propose a price of $90 for the product. This is a bit higher than your offer, but still lower than my initial asking price. I hope we can reach an agreement that suits both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
