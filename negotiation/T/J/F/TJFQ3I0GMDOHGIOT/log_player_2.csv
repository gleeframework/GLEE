"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value may differ. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is better than $100, Bob can potentially get the product for even less by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. To continue our negotiation, I propose a price of $90 for the product. This is a bit higher than your offer, but still lower than my initial asking price. I hope we can reach an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $80. While $90 is closer to Bob's goal than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay at this stage.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hesitant to go above $85. It's the absolute maximum I can afford at this moment. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering your initial offer and my willingness to negotiate.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
