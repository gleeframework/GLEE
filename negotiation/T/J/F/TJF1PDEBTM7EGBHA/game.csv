"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $850,000 would be a fair price. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a significant investment on my end.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still less than I'm comfortable with.  To be fair to us both, would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I could stretch my budget to $980,000, but that's really my limit.",980000.0,Bob,6,
