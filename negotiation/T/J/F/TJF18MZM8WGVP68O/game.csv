"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $50 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle? I could let it go for $170.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $170 is still much higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I could go up to $65, but that's really my limit.",65.0,Bob,4,
