"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great deal for this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a no-brainer. $200 is far above your budget and Alice's starting price is ridiculously high. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $200 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $50 for this item."",
""product_price"": 50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a lower initial counteroffer. This leaves room for you to gradually increase your offer while gauging Alice's flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $50, you're setting a low anchor point in Alice's mind. While she may not agree to a price this low, it might influence her to make a more significant counteroffer than if you started higher.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** You have a lot of ground to cover between $50 and your maximum budget of $80. 
 
Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $50 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle? I could let it go for $170. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved down a bit, $170 is still way above your $80 maximum. She's trying to ""meet in the middle,"" but her idea of the middle is skewed towards her starting price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests she might be open to a much lower price. You need to signal that you're serious about a lower price point. 

Let's keep negotiating but be prepared to walk away if she doesn't budge enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $170 is still much higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I could go up to $65, but that's really my limit."",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase, Firm Limit:** By increasing your offer to $65, you're showing Alice you're willing to negotiate but also setting a firm boundary. This increase is significant enough to demonstrate good faith but keeps you well below her price and your maximum. 
* **Honesty and Transparency:** Being upfront about your budget limitations can encourage Alice to make a more realistic offer. If she's truly motivated to sell, she'll need to work within your constraints.

This counteroffer balances flexibility and firmness, putting the ball back in Alice's court."
