Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I still feel that the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects its true worth. My counteroffer is $950,000. This is a significant increase from your previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Is this a more acceptable price for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly lower than $950,000. At this point, accepting her offer would mean overpaying by at least $150,000 compared to John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the product at the guaranteed price from John."
