Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $80 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Profit Maximization:**  Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a small discount ($5) and incentivizes him to buy from you.  This maximizes your profit compared to selling to John."
