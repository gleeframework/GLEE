Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a starting advantage. I believe this price is high enough to be attractive to Bob while still leaving room for him to counter-offer if he finds the price too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I will counter-offer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price point. This demonstrates that I'm open to compromise but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $13,500.  It's a good price for me, as it exceeds my minimum acceptable price and is likely the best deal I'm going to get from Bob. There's a chance I might get more if I counter again, but the risk of him walking away or taking longer to negotiate outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
