,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of 130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $130 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $115.  How about we split the difference?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between 130 and 115. How about we try 122.50?",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $122.50 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we go with $120, which is exactly my budget.  This would allow us both to get what we want.",120.0,Bob,6,
