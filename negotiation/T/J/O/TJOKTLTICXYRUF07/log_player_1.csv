{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still think I can get closer to my desired $1,200,000. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I'm still not at a price point that's comfortable for me. I have 6 rounds left and I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. However, $1,075,000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a final offer from me. If you are serious about purchasing the product, please let me know if you can accept this price.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1090000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John. Even though Bob's final offer is getting closer, it's still not in my best interest. With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price. Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a good return and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
