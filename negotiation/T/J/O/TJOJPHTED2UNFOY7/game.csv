"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to purchase it at a slightly lower price point.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $800,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
