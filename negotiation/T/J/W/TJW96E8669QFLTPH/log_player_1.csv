"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product is worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the significant value this product brings to your operations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering $1,050,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,050,000 is significantly higher than John's offer, and we're getting closer to my desired price.  There's a risk that I could push for a higher price, but with only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking a deal."
