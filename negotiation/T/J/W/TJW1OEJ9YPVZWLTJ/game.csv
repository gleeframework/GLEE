"Alice,  while I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, considering its potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,700,000 is still above what I can comfortably spend. How about $1,200,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value to me, while still allowing you to make a good profit.  Let's aim for a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
