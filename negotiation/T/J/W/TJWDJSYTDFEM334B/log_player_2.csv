{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob has already tried to negotiate down to his target price of $85, and Alice is not willing to go that low.  He's already down to $92.50, so there's not much more room to negotiate with Alice. It's better to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $80."
