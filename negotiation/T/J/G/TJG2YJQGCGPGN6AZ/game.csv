"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $8500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a bit more than $8500.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $8750. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about buying and keeps the deal moving forward.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  $9000 seems like a reasonable compromise, and it would allow us to finally close this deal.  Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $8750.  Let's try $8875. It's a small step towards closing the deal, and it shows I'm serious about finding a solution we both can agree on.",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm getting a little frustrated with this back and forth. $8875 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8950, but that's my final offer. Let's not waste any more time.  Are we going to do this or not?",8950.0,Alice,7,
