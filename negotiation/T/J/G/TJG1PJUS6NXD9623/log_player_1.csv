Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us both, $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,000,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could push for a slightly higher price, $950,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($800,000) and a good deal overall. Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but there's a risk he might significantly lower his offer in future rounds.  Accepting now secures a strong profit."
