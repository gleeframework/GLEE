"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,500 is still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm countering with $11,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, and still leaves a decent profit margin.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired profit margin. With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to make a decision. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit, while continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
