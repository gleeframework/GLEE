"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for a product worth $100 to you, and it's closer to what I need to get out of it.  Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
