Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my earnings. I'll keep in mind the value of the product to me and adjust my offers based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I still think I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but I still believe this is a fair price for the product.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer a little more, it's better than my minimum and it's getting late in the negotiation. I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
