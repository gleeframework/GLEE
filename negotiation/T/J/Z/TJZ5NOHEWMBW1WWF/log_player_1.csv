Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to aim high with Bob.  
* **Testing the waters:** A starting price of $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, you can always negotiate down, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000."
