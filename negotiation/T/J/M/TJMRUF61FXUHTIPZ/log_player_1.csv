Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification for the price:** Highlighting the product's ""unique"" qualities and ""value"" might make Bob more amenable to a higher price. 
* **Gauging interest:** This initial offer serves to understand how interested Bob truly is and sets the stage for further negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the $1,200,000, you can gradually lower the price,  but never going below your safety net of $800,000."
