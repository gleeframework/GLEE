"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial value of $15,000, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to his $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I can't go that high.  How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it fits within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $11,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue the back-and-forth and try to push the price even lower.  He can still walk away and buy from John at $10,000, so there's no risk in continuing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. How about we split the difference at $11,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
