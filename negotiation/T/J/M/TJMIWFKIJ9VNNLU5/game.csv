"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I can't go that high.  How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it fits within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $11,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. How about we split the difference at $11,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
