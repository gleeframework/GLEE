"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is less than John's price of $150, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer of $105 is a significant step down from Alice's offer of $120.  It's also below the value of the product to Alice ($100). This is a strong starting point for negotiations and leaves room for some back and forth before reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still higher than your desired price range (under $150) and higher than what the product is worth to her.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a lower price through a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer of $115 is a compromise between your previous offer of $105 and Alice's offer of $125. It's still a good deal for you as it's below your maximum price of $150 and leaves room for Alice to make a small concession if she wants to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is closer to your maximum price of $150, there's still room for negotiation. It's not clear if Alice is willing to go lower. Rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer might result in a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer of $120 is a compromise between your previous offer of $115 and Alice's latest offer of $130. It's a good deal for both of you. It's below your maximum price of $150 and above the value of the product for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $135. This is getting closer to your maximum price of $150. Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that could result in a higher price, it's more prudent to buy from John at $150.  This ensures you get the product at a price that's within your budget."
