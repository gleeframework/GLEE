"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Showing Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended, encouraging Bob to counter-offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I'm willing to accept a price higher than John's offer.
* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counter-offer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* I'll keep in mind the number of rounds remaining and John's offer as I negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's counter-offer shows interest, there's still room to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I have John's $15,000 offer as a fallback option.

**Strategy:**

* I'll make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $15,000.  
* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and the remaining rounds to determine my next move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, given the value I know this product holds.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering with Compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price.
* **Mid-Point Approach:**  $17,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to keep him engaged.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* If Bob still rejects my offer, I'll adjust my counter-offers based on his responses and the remaining rounds. 
* John's offer is always in the back of my mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $12000 is a fair price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $14,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has moved closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer risks losing the deal, as I only have six rounds left.

**Strategy:**

* Accepting this offer secures a sale that's almost at my desired price and minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* While John's offer is a safe option, it's a lower price than what I'm likely to get from Bob."
