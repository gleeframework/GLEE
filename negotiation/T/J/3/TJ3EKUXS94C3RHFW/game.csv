"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, Bob, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, so I'd like to offer $10250. Would you be willing to accept this price?",10250.0,Bob,6,
