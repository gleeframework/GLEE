"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $825000 is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and rarity. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $825000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $775000 is a more reasonable price. I'm trying to be fair, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $795000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",795000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this offer. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $1200000 if we can't come to an agreement. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $775000. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to do business with you.",775000.0,Bob,6,
