"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be very valuable to you. How does $110 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell quickly (""before I list it publicly""). By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're a savvy buyer and might encourage her to propose a lower price."
