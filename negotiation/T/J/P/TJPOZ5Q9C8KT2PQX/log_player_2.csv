"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer because buying the product from her for $2,000,000 is too expensive for me. I can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, which is a better deal.
