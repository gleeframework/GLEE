# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While $950,000 is still a high price, it's $50,000 less than what John is asking.
* **The goal is to save money.**  Since you can get the product for a lower price from Alice, it's the more financially sound decision."
