"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $105 for this product.  Let's keep talking and see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a little below where I need to be. I'm prepared to drop my price to $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
