This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $475,000 less than John's price and $225,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice is clearly firming up her price. It's unlikely you'll get a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has the risk of Alice walking away, leaving you to buy from John at the higher price.

While you might be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal, the potential savings are probably not worth the risk at this point."
