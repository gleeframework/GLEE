"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my profits, so I start with a price that's close to what I know the product is worth to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $1,000 gap allows for some back-and-forth without immediately reaching a stalemate.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $12,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:**  $12,000 is below my minimum threshold of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and demonstrate my willingness to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the value the product holds for Bob to encourage acceptance.
* **Positive framing:** I aim for a ""middle ground"" solution to make the counteroffer seem reasonable and collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $12,500. This price respects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum threshold of $10,000.
* **Limited time:** We are already in round 4, and I need to be mindful of the 10-round limit. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I continue to reject Bob's offers, he might lose interest, and I could end up selling to John for a lower price.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of a worse outcome."
