Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at a minimum of $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations with a price of $1,200,000.  This reflects its immense value and potential for your business. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I have 9 more rounds to try and close a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's find common ground and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $1,000,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
