Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still giving me a good starting point.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  My message emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario. 
* **Keep John in mind:** While I'm aiming for the best possible price, I need to be mindful of the fact that John is offering $1,500,000. I want to get close to that amount, but not risk losing Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about we set the product price at $1,350,000? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John.
* **Opportunity to counteroffer:**  I have a chance to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me more leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to meet my minimum while offering you a great deal. Let's find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $1,450,000 is halfway between my previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,350,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  The message emphasizes the need for a compromise, reminding Bob that we need to find a solution that works for both of us.

**Strategy:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've considered your latest offer, and I'd like to propose $1,400,000 as the product price. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is exactly my minimum price.
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might not get a better price from him. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While $1,400,000 isn't as good as John's offer, I have that option if negotiations with Bob break down.

**Conclusion:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that meets my minimum price requirement. This is a good outcome, especially considering the potential for further negotiations to be unproductive."
