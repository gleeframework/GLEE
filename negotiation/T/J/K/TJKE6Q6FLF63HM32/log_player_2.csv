"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $130. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

While $130 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  There are still rounds remaining, so there's a chance to get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is a fair compromise, and it's still within Bob's budget.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best course of action to secure the product while staying within Bob's budget."
