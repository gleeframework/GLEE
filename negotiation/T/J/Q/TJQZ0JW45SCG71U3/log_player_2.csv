**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good deal. Here's why:

* **Savings:** You save $300,000 compared to buying from John ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000 = $300,000).
* **Within Budget:**  The price is well below your $1,500,000 maximum.
* **Fair Negotiation:** While closer to your maximum, the price likely reflects some profit for Alice (who values it at $1,000,000) and a reasonable compromise. 

Accepting this offer gets you the product you need at a significant discount."
