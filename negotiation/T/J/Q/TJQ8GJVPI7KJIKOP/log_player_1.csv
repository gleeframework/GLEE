Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise.  I'm willing to make a deal at $1,100,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more if Bob accepts a price above that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $100,000 discount from his perceived value.
    * We earn an extra $100,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Exclusivity Factor:** By phrasing the offer as ""exclusive,"" we aim to incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially prevent him from lowballing.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest potential profit while still having a secure backup option."
