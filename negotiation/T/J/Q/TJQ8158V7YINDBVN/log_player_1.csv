"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll offer the product to Bob for $775,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it will be more appealing to him.
