"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to you, and it's a good deal.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation or pay more to John."
