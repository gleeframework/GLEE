Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $11,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. I believe this product is worth more than what you're offering, but I'm willing to make a concession to try to reach an agreement.

While Alice is coming down in price, $11,000 is still outside my ideal price range. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my goal.  I'm not yet at a point where buying from John is the most attractive option, as I'm confident we can find a mutually acceptable price."

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final push, increasing my offer again while still staying within my acceptable range.  I'm emphasizing my commitment to the product and my desire to reach an agreement.

# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
