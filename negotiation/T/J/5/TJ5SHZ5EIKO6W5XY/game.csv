"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe $1,050,000 is a fair compromise that reflects its worth. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
