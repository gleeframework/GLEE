"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price around $1300000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1300000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm prepared to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1400000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so how about we try $1350000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
