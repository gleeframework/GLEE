"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher than $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm getting closer to what I can do, but $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $10,500.  Let's settle at $11,000, my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet that number.  Would you be willing to do $10,750? That's the best I can offer.",10750.0,Bob,6,
