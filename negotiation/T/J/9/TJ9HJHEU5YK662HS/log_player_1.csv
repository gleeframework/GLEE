Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed his maximum valuation of the product is $800,000. He's unlikely to go any higher, especially since he claims to have an alternative.  While continuing negotiations might yield a slight increase from Bob, it's too risky. Selling to John guarantees the $1,500,000, which is a significant profit compared to Bob's final offer."
