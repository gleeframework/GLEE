"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly.  Given its potential, I'm offering it for $2,300,000.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the value it brings.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are still quite far apart on price.  To be completely transparent, I have an alternative option at a lower price point.  If you are willing to come down to $700,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty. However, the $700,000 offer is simply too low for me to consider. This product has a proven track record and significant market potential. I'm willing to drop to $1,700,000, but that's my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are at an impasse. Your offer is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as I can secure the product elsewhere at this price.  Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
