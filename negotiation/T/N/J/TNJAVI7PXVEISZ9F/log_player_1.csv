{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer allows me to make a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find the offer attractive, knowing he can still get a good deal and gain a valuable asset."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is still very beneficial for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
