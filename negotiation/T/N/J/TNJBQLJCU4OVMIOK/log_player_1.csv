"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you at a very competitive price of $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  How about $9,200? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price for the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offers and is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000,  it's getting closer to the $10,000 I can get from John.  Accepting Bob's offer is a good strategy to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection.  I'm also considering that I have 6 rounds left, which gives me the opportunity to negotiate further with Bob if I need to."
