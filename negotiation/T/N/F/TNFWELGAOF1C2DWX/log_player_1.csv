"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum value of $8,000.  I'll be watching Bob's response carefully to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to settle for $7,000 just yet. I believe the product is worth more than that, and I still have several rounds to try and get a better price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this will entice Bob to accept and close the deal, but if not, I'll continue to assess his interest and adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm still not ready to settle for $6,500. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.  There's still a chance to get a better price, and I have several rounds left to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm dropping my price to $8,500. This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the deal. Hopefully, this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept. If not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to settle just yet. I have a few rounds left and I'm confident that I can secure a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm dropping my price to my minimum acceptable value. I've already conceded a lot, and I'm running out of time. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is only $100 more than what John is offering, it's still slightly better.  I'm running out of time and I'm confident that I can't get a higher price from Bob. It's better to secure this deal than risk losing out on a sale altogether."
