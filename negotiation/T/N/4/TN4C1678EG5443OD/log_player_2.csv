"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it presents a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While that price doesn't quite work for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target:** $13,500 is just $1,500 above Bob's ideal price of $12,000.  
* **Further negotiation might be risky:** Bob has already rejected one offer and it's possible Alice will become less flexible.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  $15,000 from John is significantly more than $13,500 from Alice. 

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting Alice's offer at $13,500 is the most reasonable choice in this situation. It's a good compromise that allows Bob to save money while securing the product."
