Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below her guaranteed price with John leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a higher final sale price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value while expressing a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he's getting a fair deal. 

By starting high but showing flexibility, Alice increases her chances of a profitable sale to Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
