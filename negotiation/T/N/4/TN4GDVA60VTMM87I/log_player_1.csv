Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and is inching closer to a reasonable price. I'm willing to push a bit further since we're still significantly above John's offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While I'd prefer to get a bit closer to $1,220,000, Bob's increments are getting smaller. There's a risk he might walk away entirely if I push too hard. Accepting at $1,210,000 secures a significant profit compared to John's offer and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
