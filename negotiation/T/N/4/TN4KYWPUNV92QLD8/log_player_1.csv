Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, $1,250,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm hoping we can get closer to a mutually acceptable price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a significant distance from what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,350,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, giving you a strong value for the product and me a price closer to my target.  Let's see if we can close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the last offer, so how about $1,300,000? I think this is a fair price for the product and would allow us to close the deal.

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to what I'd like, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and try one more time to get a price closer to my target."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm going to come down just a bit more, to $1,325,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $1,275,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I'd like to get a better price, Bob is not willing to budge much further, and we're running out of time.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so that's the best option at this point."
