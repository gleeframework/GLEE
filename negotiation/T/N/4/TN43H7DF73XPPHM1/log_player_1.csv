Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter based on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum price. I won't accept it right away.  I'll see if I can get a little more by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, it's enough to get a deal without having to go through more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I would have preferred to get a little more, I'm guaranteed $120, which is better than risking a lower offer from Bob."
