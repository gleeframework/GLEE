{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a good price, but it's still worth exploring if you can get it lower.  There's no harm in seeing if Alice will budge."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 17% discount from Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it shows that I'm serious about getting a good deal. If Alice rejects this, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a lower price. I'm confident I can get a better deal without risking buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a good price. I'm hoping to meet halfway with Alice's offer and secure a deal in this round."
