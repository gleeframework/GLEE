Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my price, but $115 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to agree.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John."
