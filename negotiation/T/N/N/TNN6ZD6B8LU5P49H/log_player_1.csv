Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly below my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This makes the offer attractive to Bob while still giving me a chance to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short of my budget, but I really like the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is equal to the value of the product for him. This means that I can't get a better price from him. While it's not my ideal price, it's still better than selling it to John for $12,000 and missing out on the opportunity to get a sale."
