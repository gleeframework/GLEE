"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can save $1,000 by getting a lower price, and you're not losing anything by rejecting the first offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your goal to save as much as possible, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what I'd like to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate a little more and see if we can meet in the middle."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,400.

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm going to counter again and try to close the gap.  I'm willing to pay $8,900 at this point, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and the fact that she's already rejected a lower offer."

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not going to budge much further.  I've already rejected several offers, and the price is getting closer to what John is offering.  It's not worth risking more rounds of negotiation when I can get the product for a fixed price from John."
