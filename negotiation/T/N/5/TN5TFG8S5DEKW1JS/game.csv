"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $950,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $825,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, to make this work within my budget, I can offer $760,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering it's significantly closer to my initial offer.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $760,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $815,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",815000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on your price, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not quite there. Considering the product's value to you and the concessions I've made so far, I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",795000.0,Alice,7,
