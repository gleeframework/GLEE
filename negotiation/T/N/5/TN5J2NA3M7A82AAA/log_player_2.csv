Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go as high as $780,000. I'm going to make one more counteroffer, and then I'll have to consider other options. I propose a final counteroffer of $815,000. This is the absolute highest I'm willing to go.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000, and even at that price, further haggling might not be worth the potential savings. It's better to secure the product from John at $1,200,000 and avoid the risk of the negotiation failing."
