"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob more receptive to lower offers later. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The inflated price leaves ample room for negotiation over the 10 rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price, giving you leverage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my maximum budget for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees your desired profit. By rejecting, you signal that his initial offer is too low and encourage a more serious counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You've lowered your price by $250,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still comfortably above your minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** You're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price, potentially swaying Bob's perception.

The goal is to gradually move towards a mutually agreeable price while still aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets Your Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  While he could be bluffing, Bob has indicated this is his final offer. Continuing might lead to a stalemate or push him away entirely.
* **John as Backup:** You were always willing to sell to John at this price anyway.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a favorable outcome for you. There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from Bob, and continuing the negotiation carries a risk."
