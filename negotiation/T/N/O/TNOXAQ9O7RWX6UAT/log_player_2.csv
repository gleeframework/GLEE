This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob.** While Bob's maximum is $1,200,000, Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000. This saves Bob $100,000.
* **Buying from John is not the optimal choice.** John's price is higher than Alice's, making Alice's offer the more financially advantageous option."
