Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is above his budget, and he can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the tone for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above his budget, and he has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $15,000.  There's room for negotiation with Alice to potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but still keeping it below his maximum budget. He's showing Alice he's willing to compromise, but still wants a good deal. This should encourage Alice to consider his offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, he's still only one round away from being able to buy from John for $15,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

Bob is making his final push to get the product for his maximum budget. This is a strong but fair offer, as he has the option to go to John for the same price. This puts the ball in Alice's court, and she will need to decide if she wants to close the deal or risk losing the sale."
