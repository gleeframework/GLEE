"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $120 to you. I am willing to sell it to you for $110. This price reflects the product's quality and exclusivity. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $120.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it. This price reflects my budget and the value I place on your product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $107 for the product. This price still reflects the value of the item while accommodating your budget. Please let me know if this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $107, which is within my budget of $120.  While I'd love to negotiate further, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. It's a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or me having to buy from John at a higher price."
