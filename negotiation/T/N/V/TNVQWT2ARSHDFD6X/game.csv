"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm happy to pay $780,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",780000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $780,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $820,000. This price still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement and reflects the product's value to you.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $820,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us to both walk away happy.",800000.0,Bob,4,
