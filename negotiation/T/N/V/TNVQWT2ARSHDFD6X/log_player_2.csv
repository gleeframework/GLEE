# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get a better price than $800,000 from her, and you only lose the time it takes to counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $780,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $820,000. This price still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement and reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

While $820,000 is closer to your target, you can likely still negotiate a lower price.  It's worth a final counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your goal."
