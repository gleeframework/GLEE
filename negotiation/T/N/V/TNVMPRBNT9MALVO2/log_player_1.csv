Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a special price of $14,000. I believe it would be very valuable to you, and this offer stands before it potentially goes to another interested party."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $14,000 is a strong starting point, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing you to potentially gain even more.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning ""another interested party"" (John) subtly introduces a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quicker.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale if he declines."
