"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can likely get a better deal than $900,000.  He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay up to $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  I'm confident this product is a great investment for me, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still confident in its value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than Bob's initial counteroffer of $800,000, but still a good price considering the product's value to Bob.  It's also lower than John's price of $1,200,000, making it the best deal available. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of further negotiation or a higher price from John."
