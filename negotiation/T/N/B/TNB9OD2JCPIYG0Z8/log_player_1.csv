"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be really interested in.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to what I believe the product is worth to Bob ($150), but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:** A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage in a negotiation. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and allows him to feel like he has a chance to influence the price."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $120 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can still potentially get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable deal.
* **John is a backup:** Even if I fail to reach an agreement with Bob, I have a guaranteed sale with John. This provides a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($120), showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the desire to close the deal, encouraging Bob to accept the counteroffer. 
* **Clear and concise message:**  I'm stating my counteroffer directly and clearly, leaving no room for misinterpretation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.
* **John remains a backup:**  I can always sell to John for $100 if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob. This provides security and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer of $130. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to drop below that yet.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're getting closer, but $127 isn't quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $129.  It's only a couple of dollars more, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 129}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility. However, I'm still above my minimum.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $128 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Only 2 rounds left:** Time is running out, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though this is a slightly lower price than I initially hoped for, it's still a good deal.  Building a positive relationship with Bob could lead to future sales where I can potentially get a better price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a quick sale and a decent profit."
