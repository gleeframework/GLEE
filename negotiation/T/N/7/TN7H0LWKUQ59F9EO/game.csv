"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we split the difference?  I'd accept $10,500. That way we both get a fair deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I can still do better than $9,500. How about we meet at $9,000, like I suggested earlier?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  Let's compromise one last time.  I'm willing to drop to $10,000. This is my final offer, and it's still a good deal for both of us.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
