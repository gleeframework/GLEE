"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000.  This is a good starting point as it gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit.  If he rejects, I can always come down a bit, or go to John if the negotiations stall."

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm not desperate yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair price and will come up a bit."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer at $1,050,000, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not the ideal price, but it's better than taking a further risk and ending up with even less.  It's important to know when to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal."
