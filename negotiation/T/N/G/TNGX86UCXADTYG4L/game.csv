"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $125. This is my final offer. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
