"Alice, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original ask is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
