{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This signals my serious intent to negotiate and creates room for compromise. While $1,100,000 is still more than my maximum budget, I'm hoping to see if Alice is willing to move towards a more agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now closer to my maximum budget, there's still some wiggle room. It's worth exploring if I can get a lower price through another counteroffer.  I'm not ready to commit at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate and move towards a compromise, but I'm still not willing to meet her full price. Hopefully, this will push Alice closer to my target price."
