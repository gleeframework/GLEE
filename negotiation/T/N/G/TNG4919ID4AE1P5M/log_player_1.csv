Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a bit lower than what the product is worth to me, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more, but if he rejects this offer, I can always go to John for the full $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer just yet. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the value of the product for me. I'm confident that we can reach a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still lower than what I'd like, but it's getting closer.  At this point, it's better to secure the sale with Bob than to risk another round of negotiation or to sell to John at a lower price than I initially hoped for."
