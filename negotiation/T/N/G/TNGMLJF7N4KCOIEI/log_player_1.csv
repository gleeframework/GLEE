"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than his offer and above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While $110 is not my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable value of $120, and I'm getting closer to my desired price with each round.  I'm also concerned about running out of rounds before I can get a better offer."
