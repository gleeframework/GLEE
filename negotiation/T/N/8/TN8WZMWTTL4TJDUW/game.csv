"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I believe the product's value to you is much higher than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best and final compromise, but I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I've already met you halfway at $1,100,000, and you're still not budging. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere, Bob. I've made concessions, but you're not willing to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,020,000. This is a compromise, but I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
