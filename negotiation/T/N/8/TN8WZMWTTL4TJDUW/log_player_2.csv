"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer considering its value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is too high. It's above my maximum budget, and there's no reason to accept it in the first round. I'll counter-offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I believe the product's value to you is much higher than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best and final compromise, but I'm confident you'll see the value in it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000, but I'm not going to jump to $1,100,000. I'll counter-offer again and try to get a better price.  I'm also considering buying from John, as his price is significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I've already met you halfway at $1,100,000, and you're still not budging. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still a little high, but I'm starting to get nervous about running out of rounds.  I'm going to counter-offer one last time to see if I can get closer to my desired price. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere, Bob. I've made concessions, but you're not willing to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,020,000. This is a compromise, but I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've made several counteroffers and Alice keeps coming back with prices that are still too high.  We are running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm uncomfortable with. John's offer is lower and more appealing at this point, so I'll go with him."
