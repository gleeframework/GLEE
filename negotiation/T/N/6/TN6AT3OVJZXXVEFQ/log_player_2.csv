"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product. While Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's $150, it's still not the best deal you could get. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate with her further or find a different seller who's willing to offer a lower price."
