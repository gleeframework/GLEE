"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I think my initial offer of $120 was a fair one. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we meet at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $125. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to think outside the box. I'm willing to meet you at $118, which is still a bit above my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",118.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $115 again? I think that's the best compromise for both of us.",115.0,Bob,6,
