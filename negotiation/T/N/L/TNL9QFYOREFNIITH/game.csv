"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. Let's start this negotiation off strong!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,300,000. It's a fair price that still gives you a significant advantage.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low.  This product is truly unique and offers exceptional value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1,350,000. It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen!",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is unique, Alice, but I've done my research and I'm not convinced it's worth $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the price I initially mentioned. If you're not willing to go any lower, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
