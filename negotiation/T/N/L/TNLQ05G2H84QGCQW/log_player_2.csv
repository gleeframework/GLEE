"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

It's always best to try and negotiate a better price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price.  Buying from John immediately would mean Bob gets the product at his desired price, but there's a chance Bob can get it for even cheaper by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his limit as possible. Offering $850,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's seriousness about negotiation. This leaves room for potential compromise in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still higher than his desired price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive, and Bob can try to push Alice closer to his target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing Alice he is willing to compromise but still wants to get the best deal possible.  Offering $875,000 is a good middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest one, increasing the likelihood of a deal in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $800,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product while staying within his budget. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and the potential for the deal to fall through is too high.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice to ensure Bob gets the product."
