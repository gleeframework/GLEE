"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that holds immense value.  I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to your endeavors. My asking price for this product is $2000000.  I believe it's a fair reflection of its potential. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I've done some research and I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. Can we meet in the middle at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the value. While $1200000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately below the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer the product for $1700000. This price reflects the product's true potential while still showing flexibility on my end. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1050000. Can we discuss this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
