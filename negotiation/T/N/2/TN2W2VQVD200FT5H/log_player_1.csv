Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $12000?  That's my max budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I will choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer.
