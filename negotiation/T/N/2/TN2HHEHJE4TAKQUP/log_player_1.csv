"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a strategy to see if he's willing to pay more than his initial value.  If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm making a more significant concession this time, getting closer to Bob's last offer.  I believe this shows good faith and could lead to a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm running out of time.  With only 4 rounds left, it's more likely I'll lose the deal entirely if I keep rejecting. $135 is a decent profit for me, and it's still a fair price for Bob."
