Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $120 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $110 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a price of $115.  It's a compromise from my previous offer, and it's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair counteroffer, and we can hopefully reach an agreement."
