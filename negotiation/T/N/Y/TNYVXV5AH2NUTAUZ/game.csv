"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I believe that's a fair price considering its value and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $750,000? It's a significant step towards your asking price and would allow us to seal the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a better price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
