# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a fantastic price considering its value. Let's make this happen!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not making much progress here. $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying, this is our chance to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice has lowered her price to his maximum budget, and if he rejects, he can still buy from John for the same price.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation."
