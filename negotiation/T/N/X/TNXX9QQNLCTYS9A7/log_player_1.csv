Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's keep talking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,150,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not making much progress here. $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying, this is our chance to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
