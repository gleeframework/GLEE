"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the market rate for similar products.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to your business and the original price I had in mind.",11500.0,Alice,3,
