"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $11,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a price closer to $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,900. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",10900.0,Alice,5,
