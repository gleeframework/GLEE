"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,175,000? This would still allow you to make a significant profit while giving me a fair price for my product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
