"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to bridge the gap, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1,050,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
