"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's a significant discount from her value ($1,200,000), but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **More negotiation could yield a better price.** Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You can always buy from John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to bridge the gap, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1,050,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise.** She's met you halfway from her previous offer, and we're now only $50,000 apart.
* **Time is a factor.** We're already three rounds in, and the longer we negotiate, the higher the risk that Alice will become less flexible or that we might run out of time. 
* **John's price is still a viable option.**  While buying from John would cost more, it's a guaranteed option if this deal falls through. 

Accepting Alice's offer allows us to secure a decent deal while minimizing the risk of losing time and potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price."
