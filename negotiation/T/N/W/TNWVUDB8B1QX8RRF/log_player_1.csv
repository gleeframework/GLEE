Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident you'll get great value out of it.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I appreciate its value, $20,000 is a bit too steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would be a fair price considering the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?  I feel that's a reasonable compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your persistence. I'm motivated to sell this, but I need a price that makes it worthwhile for me. Could you consider $14,500?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we both want to make a deal.  I could stretch my budget to $13,000.  That's a big jump for me, but I believe this product is worth it.  What do you say?

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's increasing his offer in small increments. At this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is already offering. Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome right now."
