"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement at that price.",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,800 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $11,200? It's a fair compromise that leaves us both with a good outcome.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,200. I'd like to make another offer: $10,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget.",10900.0,Bob,4,
