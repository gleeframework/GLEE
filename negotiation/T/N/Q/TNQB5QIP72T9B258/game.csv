"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle at $1150000. Is this a more acceptable price for you?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let me think about it for a moment. I am willing to increase my offer to $1125000. This is my final offer, as my budget constraints are quite strict.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not convinced that $1125000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. Let's meet at $1200000. This is my best and final offer for this round",1200000.0,Alice,5,
