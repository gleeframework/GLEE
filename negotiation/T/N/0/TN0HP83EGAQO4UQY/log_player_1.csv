"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a rare opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a high initial offer like $1,800,000 allows for potential negotiation downwards while still aiming for a significantly higher profit margin than the minimum. This strategy:

* **Anchors high:** It sets a high reference point for Bob, potentially influencing his perception of the product's value.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It signals a willingness to negotiate while making Bob work towards a price closer to your minimum.
* **Maintains John as a backup:**  You retain the option to walk away and accept John's $1,000,000 offer if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from owning this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a significant profit, we're aiming for the best possible outcome. Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Gauge Bob's willingness to move:**  His counteroffer suggests he's open to paying above his perceived value. 
* **Maintain a negotiating position:** Accepting immediately might signal we're willing to settle for less. 
* **We still have options:** We're only in round 2, and John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value. While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable offer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and the potential benefits it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're lowering our price by $200,000, signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** We're not dropping to his price immediately, demonstrating the product's value to us.
* **Maintaining a strong position:** The new price still allows for a substantial profit above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,520,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,520,000 represents a strong profit of $520,000. Here's why accepting makes sense now:

* **Significant Gain:**  We've secured a price significantly above our minimum and above what Bob initially indicated he'd pay. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  Bob's framing of ""meeting halfway"" creates a sense of fairness and compromise, making it less likely he'll walk away.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we might be able to push for a bit more in further rounds, the potential gains are less certain. Accepting now guarantees a very good deal."
