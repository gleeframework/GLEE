"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a rare opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from owning this product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value. While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable offer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and the potential benefits it holds for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,520,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1520000.0,Bob,4,
