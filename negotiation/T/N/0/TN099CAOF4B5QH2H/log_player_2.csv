Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $8,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value I've already added to it, and I believe it's a price you can live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
