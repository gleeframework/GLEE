"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm feeling very comfortable with my offer of $850,000 and think it's fair to both of us.  If this doesn't work for you, I may have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $850,000 is a fair price for both of us, given the value we both see in this product. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still not willing to meet me in the middle, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000, but I need you to agree to a small addendum: I'll throw in an additional feature that's worth $20,000. This way, you'll be getting an even better deal than before. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you throwing in the additional feature, but I'm still focused on the base price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product without the additional feature.  This is a fair price for both of us, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still focused on the base price, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $860,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to someone else.
