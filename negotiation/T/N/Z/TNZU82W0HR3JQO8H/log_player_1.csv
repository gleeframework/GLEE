Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I think it would be incredibly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good idea to start negotiations a bit higher than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you come down in price later.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he flatly rejects it, we know he's probably very price-sensitive. If he counters, it gives us a starting point for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:**  Remember, we have John as a backup who will buy the product for $10,000. This knowledge gives us leverage. We don't need to desperately accept any offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for it. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price ($10,000), we still have some negotiating room. We know John will buy it for $10,000, but it's worth trying to get a little more from Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $11,000? That would make this a worthwhile deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're coming down from our previous offer ($12,000) but not all the way to Bob's price.  A counteroffer like this shows a willingness to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a fair price. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer essentially splits the difference between Bob's offer ($9,500) and our fallback price with John ($10,000) while still leaving room for Bob to come up a little.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  We're still above John's offer, so we have a cushion and don't appear desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal, but unfortunately, $11,000 is still beyond my budget. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going to John, as we won't get a better outcome.  Accepting $10,000 is the best move."
