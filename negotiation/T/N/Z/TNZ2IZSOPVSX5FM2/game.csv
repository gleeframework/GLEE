"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's worth considering at a price of $20,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price for my investment.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a better deal than your initial offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to consider $14,000, which is a fair price for me. Can we meet at this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $17,000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to listen to your thoughts.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $17,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $17,000, which would be $15,500. Can we consider this price?",15500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $15,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to think about my investment. I'm offering the product to you for $18,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",18000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $18,000 is not acceptable to me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000, but no higher. Can we meet at this price?",16000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to make one last compromise, but I need to think about my investment. I'm offering the product to you for $19,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",19000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $19,000 is not acceptable to me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm making a final offer of $15,000, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8,000.",15000.0,Bob,10,
