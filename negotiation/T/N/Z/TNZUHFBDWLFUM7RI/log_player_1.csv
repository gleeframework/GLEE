"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice and I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000. I'm confident that this is a fair offer considering the value it will bring to you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us. While selling to John is tempting, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer the product for $900,000. This reflects its inherent worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $650,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product.  While his offer is moving closer to a reasonable range, accepting now would be leaving a substantial amount of money on the table.  We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but we're still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to move down slightly to $850,000.  This offer reflects my strong desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $680,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and his increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
