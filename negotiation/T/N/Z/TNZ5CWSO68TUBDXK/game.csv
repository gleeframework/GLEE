"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to be closer to $600,000 to make it work.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,500,000 represents its true value, I understand your perspective.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to consider $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but that's still outside my budget.  If you're able to get closer to $700,000, I think we might be able to make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make a final offer at $950,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a more than fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
