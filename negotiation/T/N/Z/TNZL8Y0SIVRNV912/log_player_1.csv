Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is slightly below my minimum but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a good deal for Bob while still securing a substantial profit for me.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" introduces a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** This strategy assumes Bob is rational and primarily motivated by financial gain.  
* **Negotiation:**  There's always a chance Bob might counter-offer. I need to be prepared to negotiate strategically to achieve the best possible outcome."
