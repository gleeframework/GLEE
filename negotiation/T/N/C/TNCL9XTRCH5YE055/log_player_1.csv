Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant costs in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it provides."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($1,000,000) sets a high anchor. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and potential cost savings justifies the high price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a final price higher than what John offers.

This approach maximizes the chance of a successful sale to Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value while still securing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John if Bob declines."
