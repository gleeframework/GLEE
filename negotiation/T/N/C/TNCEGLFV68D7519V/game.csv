"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit below my minimum price.

"I'm still interested in the product, but $850000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $750000. Can you consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750000 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $775000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's unique features. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
