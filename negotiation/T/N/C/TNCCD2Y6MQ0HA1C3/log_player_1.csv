I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $9,500, I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation. I'll see what kind of counteroffer I can get from Bob in the next round."

Bob has offered my minimum price, which is what John is also willing to pay. It's a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale by trying to get a higher price."
