Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $14,000. I believe this product would be very valuable to you, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $14,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts. He gets a $2,000 discount from your asking price, and you make $1,000 more than selling to John.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates you're open to negotiation, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a price closer to your $15,000 goal."
