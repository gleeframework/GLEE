"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's still a great price for a fantastic product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is a fair compromise. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a great value for you as well. Let's close this deal!",125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $125, which would be $122.50. Would you be willing to accept that price?",122.5,Bob,6,
