"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This would represent a substantial discount from my initial offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair compromise given the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute bottom line. I believe this is a very fair offer considering the true worth of this product.",15000.0,Alice,5,
