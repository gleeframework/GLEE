"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position, and I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential eagerness to acquire the product.  If he rejects, we'll have 9 more rounds to adjust the price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet.  I'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also  that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, but if he doesn't come closer to my desired price, I'll be ready to sell to John in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still within my acceptable range. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. I believe there's still room for him to increase his offer, and I want to maximize my potential earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm still committed to negotiating.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. If not, I'll be ready to sell to John in the next round."
