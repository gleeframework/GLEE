"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I really like the product and think it has a lot of potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $975,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to gain from the deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $975,000. Would you be willing to consider $925,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I was thinking.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $925,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my last offer. Let's split the difference and go with $950,000. This ensures we both walk away with a profitable deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is the price I mentioned earlier. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at this price?",925000.0,Bob,6,
