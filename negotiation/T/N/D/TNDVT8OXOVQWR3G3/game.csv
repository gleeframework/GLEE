"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that works for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than the value I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $775,000? I'm ready to close the deal if that number works for you.",775000.0,Bob,4,
