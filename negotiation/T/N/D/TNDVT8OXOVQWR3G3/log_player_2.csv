"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly above your maximum price. While it's good to be aware of the potential value to your business, you have a firm budget. Rejecting and providing a counteroffer will allow you to negotiate a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that works for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

* **Is well below Alice's asking price:** This signals that you are serious about a lower price point.
* **Is still significantly below your maximum:**  This gives you room to negotiate up if needed.
* **Provides a specific number:**  This gives Alice a concrete figure to consider.

The message aims to be polite but firm, expressing your interest while making your budget constraints clear."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than the value I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to your limit, it's still above what John is offering. You have some room to negotiate before resorting to John's offer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go slightly lower, especially as you've shown genuine interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $775,000? I'm ready to close the deal if that number works for you."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splits the difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($850,000) and your previous offer ($700,000). 
* **Stays below your maximum:** It keeps you within your budget while leaving a small margin for potential further negotiation.
* **Expresses urgency:**  The message emphasizes your desire to finalize the deal, potentially motivating Alice to accept."
