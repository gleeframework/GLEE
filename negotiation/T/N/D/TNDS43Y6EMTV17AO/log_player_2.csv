"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $1,200,000.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  The product is only worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  It's a fair starting point for negotiations, as it's more than half-way between Alice's value of $800,000 and Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down on her price, which is a good sign.  However, Bob can still likely get a better deal. He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  It's possible that a few more rounds of back-and-forth could get them closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. While Alice offered $1,100,000, Bob is proposing $1,000,000, which is closer to his target price without pushing Alice too far. This shows that Bob is willing to negotiate but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and leaving him with no product is high. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the potential for a complete breakdown in negotiations."
