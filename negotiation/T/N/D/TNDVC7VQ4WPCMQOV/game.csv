,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product to you, I'd be willing to pay $950000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit and me to secure the product for a reasonable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1050000 is my final offer. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still getting me a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
