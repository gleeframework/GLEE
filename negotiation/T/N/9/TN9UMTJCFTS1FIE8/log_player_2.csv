"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your specific needs and comes highly recommended by previous satisfied customers. I believe it's a perfect match for you. Would you like to purchase it for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's first offer is close to her value, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($70) allows for negotiation room while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Alice.
* **Polite and engaged:** The message expresses continued interest and a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Alice to continue the conversation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. Considering your feedback, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose to sell the product for $80. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a significant amount from her original offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still room to meet closer to my target price. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards my desired price point. 
* **Creating a sense of fairness:**  Framing it as ""meeting in the middle"" can make Alice more receptive to the offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** Continuing to express appreciation and focus on finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to offer the product at $77. This price reflects the value you're getting while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal gains at this point:**  Alice is clearly trying to inch the price upwards. While I could push for $75 or even $76, the potential savings are getting smaller and it risks jeopardizing the deal.
* **Good overall price:** $77 is a solid discount from Alice's initial offer and a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Time is a factor:**  We've already used half the rounds. Continuing to negotiate for minimal gains increases the risk of reaching no agreement, forcing me to buy from John at full price."
