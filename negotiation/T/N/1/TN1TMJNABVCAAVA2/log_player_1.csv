Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that could significantly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product holds a value of $1,500,000 for Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000, aiming closer to Bob's valuation allows you to maximize your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,300,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high asking price. 

This strategy balances risk and potential reward. While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, the potential for a significantly higher profit than John's offer makes it a worthwhile gamble."
