"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price close to the middle ground between our valuations. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's, but I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is close enough to my desired range. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which might lead to a lower price or even a failed deal."
