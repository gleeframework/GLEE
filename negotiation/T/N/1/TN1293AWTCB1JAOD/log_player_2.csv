"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $100. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 for it at this time."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $160 for the product. How about we compromise at $165? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $180, it's still above my maximum budget of $100. I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $155? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still above my maximum budget of $100. I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like we're not going to reach an agreement. At this point, it's more sensible to purchase the product from John for $100, which is within my budget and ensures I get the product."
