Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can do $145, but I think we can do even better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $135, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $135, and it's getting close to my maximum budget.  I can get a guaranteed price from John without further negotiation."
