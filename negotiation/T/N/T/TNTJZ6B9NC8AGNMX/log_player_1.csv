Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still leaving some room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my desired price. While I would prefer $115,  accepting his offer for $110 ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
