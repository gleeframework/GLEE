"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering the product for $115. While this is close to your limit, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also trying to get the best possible price."
