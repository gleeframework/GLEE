"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to you and the potential returns it offers me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective. While $950000 is a step closer, it's still significantly below the value I'm seeking. I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This price acknowledges both your need for a good deal and my need to achieve a profitable transaction. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a profitable transaction, and I'm still very interested in this product. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This price is a fair compromise, allowing us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's aim for a final agreement on this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
