Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  I'm asking for $1,300,000. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to start negotiations high with Bob. This gives you room to potentially negotiate down while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic positioning:** Offering the product at $1,300,000  positions it as a premium option while still leaving Bob with a potential $500,000 in perceived value ($1,300,000 offer vs. his $800,000 valuation). 
* **Open for negotiation:** The message implies you're open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving room to secure a deal with Bob."
