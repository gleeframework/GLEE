Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000** is a starting point that is above your minimum value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation but also shows that you value the product.
* **The message** is friendly and encouraging. It highlights the potential value of the product to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Get a higher price:** Starting with a high offer increases the likelihood of securing a price above your minimum.
* **Initiate negotiation:**  The message sets the stage for negotiation and encourages Bob to express his interest and counteroffer.
* **Maintain control:** By having a backup buyer in John, you are not pressured to accept any counteroffer that is significantly lower than your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $12000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly less than your initial offer.  You want to see if you can get closer to your desired price.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejection:** You are rejecting Bob's offer to continue negotiating and hopefully get a better price.
* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, you will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between your current asking price and Bob's offer.

**Note:** Remember, you have John as a backup buyer, which gives you the leverage to be more assertive in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's counteroffer and expresses willingness to compromise while emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Counteroffer:**  The counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping a decent profit margin for you.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating a willingness to compromise can help to keep the negotiations moving.
* **Maintain leverage:**  While the counteroffer is lower than your initial price, it's still higher than Bob's offer, giving you the upper hand.
* **Encourage agreement:** The message emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob, aiming to push him towards acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12750?  Let's get this done! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,750 is only $250 away from your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  This is a very small difference and accepting his offer will:

* **Secure a sale:**  This avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a breakdown in the negotiations.
* **Maximize profit:** Even though it's not your ideal price, it's still a significant profit considering your minimum.

**Strategy:**

While you could continue negotiating, the risk of a lower offer or a failed negotiation is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and financially advantageous decision in this situation."
