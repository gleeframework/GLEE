"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is still a significant discount from your initial price, but it's more in line with my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  How about $1,400,000? This would still offer you a substantial savings compared to my initial offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  How about $1,375,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a significant discount while ensuring I receive a reasonable return.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. While I understand you're working within a budget, $1,325,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to make one final concession.

This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
