"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it still allows you to make a good profit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a fair deal too. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
