"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but $9500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $10500?  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell it to you for $11500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",11500.0,Alice,5,
