"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
