"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($1,200,000).  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
