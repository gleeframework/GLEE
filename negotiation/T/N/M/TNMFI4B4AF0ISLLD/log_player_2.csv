"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's too early to accept, and rejecting gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000, reflecting the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,100,000 falls short of what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to consider $1,350,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise, reflecting the product's true potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget of $1,000,000. You have time to continue negotiating, and there's still room for Alice to lower the price.  Rejecting allows you to continue exploring a more favorable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try $1,200,000.  This price represents a significant investment for me, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
