"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I'm still hesitant to go above $9,000.  I understand you think it's worth more, but my budget is tight.  Let's split the difference and settle at $9,500.  This is a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
