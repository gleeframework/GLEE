Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering slightly below his perceived value leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal even if he doesn't negotiate lower.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $1,400,000 is a substantial profit over your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and John's offer."
