"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of immense value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it's worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows me to achieve my desired profit margin while still leaving you with a significant gain.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
