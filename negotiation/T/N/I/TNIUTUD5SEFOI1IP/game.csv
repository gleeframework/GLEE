"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $14000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $15800. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",15800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $15800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14200?",14200.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $14200 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $15000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. Plus, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. I'm willing to meet you halfway to make a deal happen.",15000.0,Alice,7,
