"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We don't want to start at $1,000,000 and risk anchoring the negotiation too high. Leaving room allows for counteroffers and a sense of progress.
* **Professional and Open Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and welcoming further discussion, setting a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it. I'd like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $750,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting would leave a lot of money on the table.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While his offer is a big jump down, it's early in the negotiation.  We have time to counter and try to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a backup:** We have the security of John's offer ($800,000), so we're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your proposal,  $750,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I could consider $900,000."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory but Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and desire for fairness while making it clear that $750,000 is unacceptable. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We've come down $50,000 from our initial offer, signaling some flexibility but not desperation.
* **Justification:**  We reiterate the value of the product without being overly aggressive, reinforcing why our price is justified. 
* **Aiming High:**  We're still aiming for a strong price within Bob's perceived value range, leaving space for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $850,000 is a good deal. It's significantly above our minimum ($800,000) and represents a successful negotiation on our part.
* **Time Value of Money:**  While we could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting now secures a good profit without risking losing the deal. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement, which can be good for future business interactions."
