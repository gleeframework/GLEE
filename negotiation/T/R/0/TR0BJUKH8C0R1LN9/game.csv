"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $175 is a bit steep for me.  How about $140? ",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $140 is a bit too low for me though.  How about we split the difference and go with $157.50?  Let's meet in the middle.",157.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $157.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $152.50.  That's closer to my budget and I think it's a fair compromise.",152.5,Bob,4,
