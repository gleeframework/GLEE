Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Value to me:** I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me.
* **Value to John:**  John is willing to pay $800,000, so this represents my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential value to Bob:**  I don't know Bob's valuation, but by offering $950,000, I'm leaving some room for negotiation. This price could be attractive to Bob if the product holds a higher value to him, and it still provides a significant profit for me.
* **Risk/Reward:**  By offering a price higher than my minimum, I'm taking a calculated risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential reward of selling the product for a higher price outweighs this risk.

If Bob rejects the offer, I'm confident that John will purchase it for $800,000, ensuring I still achieve a profitable outcome."
