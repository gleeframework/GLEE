Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will give you an idea of his perceived value. If he outright rejects the offer, you can adjust downwards. If he counters, you know he's interested. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a safety net with John willing to buy at $12,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be more firm in your negotiation with Bob."
