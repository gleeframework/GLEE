Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been unwavering from his $10,000 offer. It's clear he won't budge.  While continuing could potentially yield a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk is that he sticks to his offer and we waste more rounds. Selling to John guarantees the $15,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer or continuing with the uncertain negotiation."
