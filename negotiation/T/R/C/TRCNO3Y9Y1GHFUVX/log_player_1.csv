Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  If Bob rejects, we can negotiate further.  I'll be ready to lower the price if necessary, but I'll also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my initial asking price.  I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is getting dangerously close to John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a significant profit and I don't want to risk losing a sale completely.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
