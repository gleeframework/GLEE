"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product, but I have to be honest with you, it's worth a lot to me. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is the same price John is offering, there is no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting her offer allows you to potentially negotiate with her or explore other options without losing out on the opportunity to buy from John."
