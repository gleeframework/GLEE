"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a fairly high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's counteroffer, I'm not ready to sell for that price just yet.  I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows a willingness to negotiate while still getting a price closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is better than what John is offering.  It's also getting closer to my desired price. I'll accept this offer and move on."
