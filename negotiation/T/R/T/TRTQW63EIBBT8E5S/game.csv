"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  While that price point is a little lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,400,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
