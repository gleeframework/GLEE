"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I appreciate your position, $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $11,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my means.",9500.0,Bob,4,
