"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $1,350,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. ",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm hoping we can find a price that suits both of us. Could we perhaps aim for $1,380,000? I believe this would still be a fair price for the product while allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit margin.",1380000.0,Bob,4,
