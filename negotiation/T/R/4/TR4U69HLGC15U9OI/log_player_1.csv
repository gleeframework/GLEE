Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to try to squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9,700 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700

At this point, Bob is not willing to go much higher, and I'm getting worried about running out of rounds.  While I would like to get a little closer to my ideal price, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $10,000."
