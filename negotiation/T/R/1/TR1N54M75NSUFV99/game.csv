"Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. Let's talk about it further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows for a maximum of $800000. I hope we can find a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1150000? This would still leave me with a decent profit, while allowing you a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
