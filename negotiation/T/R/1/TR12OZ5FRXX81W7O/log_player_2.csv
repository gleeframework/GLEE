# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is more than his budget and he can get the same product from John for $1,000,000. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $900,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. Let's make a deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his target price and only $50,000 less than what he can buy it for from John. There's still room for negotiation."
