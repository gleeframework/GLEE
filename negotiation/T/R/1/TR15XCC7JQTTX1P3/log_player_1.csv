"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but allows room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is interested in this price, and gauge his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000, as that is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject his offer and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,000. This is still higher than my minimum but represents a significant drop from my initial offer. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still too low. I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $11,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product but also that I'm not willing to go much lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still offering too low, even after several rounds of negotiation.  I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss on my product. Selling to John for $12,000 is a better option, as it's closer to my minimum value and guarantees a sale."
