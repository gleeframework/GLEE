"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you value it at $1,000,000 and I'm willing to sell it for a little more than my minimum. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It makes more sense to buy from John at the lower price."
