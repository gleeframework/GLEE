I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $14,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  I believe this is still a fair price, considering my minimum.  Hopefully, this will be a successful counteroffer!"

Bob is not budging on his price, and I'm getting impatient.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $15,000.  I'm not going to waste any more time on this negotiation."
