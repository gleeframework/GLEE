"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product. I'm confident you'll see the value it brings and be willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can definitely get a better deal than that! Alice is starting high, indicating there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get her to come down significantly in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to anchor the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This leaves room for us to gradually increase our offer while still potentially securing a price well below her starting point. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While our offer is much lower, we maintain a polite and interested tone.  This helps avoid alienating Alice and keeps the negotiation moving. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Our counter-offer anticipates further back-and-forth.  We've given Alice plenty of space to counter, signaling our willingness to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $800,000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll get from the product, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down $100,000, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. However, we're still in early rounds. Let's continue pushing for a better price by rejecting and offering a counter that gradually moves towards a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $800,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $680,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 680000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're raising our offer, but strategically so. An $80,000 increase shows Alice we're willing to move, but not at the pace she's set. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" helps position our offer as reasonable and encourages Alice to reciprocate.
* **Staying below $700,000:** We're still aiming to secure the product significantly below the $700,000 mark, leaving room for potential further negotiation while staying well under our $1,000,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm now offering the product to you for $750,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial point in the negotiation.  Alice is signaling this is her ""best offer."" However, we still have five rounds left and are within striking distance of a much better deal. We need to show Alice we're serious and willing to walk away if necessary.  By rejecting and countering aggressively one more time, we might persuade her to make a final concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a tough pill for me to swallow.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. "",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  We're presenting this as our ""best and final"" offer to create a sense of urgency. This might be the push Alice needs to meet us. 
* **Justifying the Stance:** By mentioning we have ""other options,"" we subtly remind Alice of John and the risk she runs of losing the sale entirely. 
* **Strategic Price Point:** $700,000 is a strong offer, representing a significant saving while still being potentially acceptable to Alice. 
* **Leaving Room for Success:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, we've left a small margin for a potential counter-offer from her in the remaining rounds."
