{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range that's very profitable for you. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** You have a guaranteed $8,000 from John, so your offer must be enticing enough for Bob to choose it over finding a potentially better deal elsewhere. 

By offering the product at $9,500, you create a win-win scenario where Bob saves $500 compared to his perceived value, and you gain a significant profit above your minimum selling price."
