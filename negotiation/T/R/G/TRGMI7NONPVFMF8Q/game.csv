"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at no less than $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1500000.  This reflects the significant value it can bring. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential value, $1500000 is a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is still a significant investment for me. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value we've discussed.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1000000 is not enough for me to part with this product, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1300000,  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I'm hoping we can find common ground. Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 isn't quite where I need to be.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1200000? This is a significant amount for me, and it would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
