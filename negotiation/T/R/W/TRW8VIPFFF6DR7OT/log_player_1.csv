"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but one that leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the full value he perceives in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $80.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than what I consider the product to be worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a price that's closer to the value I perceive in the product. Hopefully, this counteroffer will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum value of $80. While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
