""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. However, $950,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,025,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could continue negotiating, accepting $975,000 is a significant profit over both my minimum selling price and John's offer. It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and risking those extra dollars isn't worth the potential loss of the deal."
