Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm not willing to go above $9,500.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still too far off from what I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to walk away from this deal if we can't find a compromise.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $10,200, which is a fair price that respects both our needs. Let's close this deal and move on. "", ""product_price"": 10200}
