"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I'm only interested in the product if the price is closer to what it's worth to me. I'm willing to offer you $8,500 for it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500. Considering its value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm not willing to go above $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm willing to buy it from you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering $11,000 for the product. This is a reasonable price considering its value to me is $15,000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still too far off from what I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to walk away from this deal if we can't find a compromise. To show my commitment to buying from you, I'm willing to offer $10,000. This price recognizes the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a purchase that fits my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $10,200, which is a fair price that respects both our needs. Let's close this deal and move on. ",10200.0,Bob,8,
