"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a steal - only $150. It's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $150 seems a bit steep for me, would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum ($80) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Polite and Positive:** Maintaining a good tone encourages Alice to continue bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is way too low. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $110 is still significantly more than both my budget and John's offer. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we both want a fair deal. How about we settle at $75? That's a good compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm increasing my offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Strategic:** My offer is still below my maximum and a good bit lower than Alice's current offer.
* **Seeking Agreement:** I'm framing the offer as mutually beneficial to encourage Alice's acceptance."
