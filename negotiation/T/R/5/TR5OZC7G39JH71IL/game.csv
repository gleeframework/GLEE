"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. How about $7,000? That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,000 yet. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. How about $8,500? That's the lowest I can go for now.",8500.0,Alice,5,
