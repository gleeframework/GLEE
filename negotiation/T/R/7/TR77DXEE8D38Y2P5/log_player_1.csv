# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I would like to propose a lower price of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While I can sell to John for $800,000, I'd like to try and get closer to that number with Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
