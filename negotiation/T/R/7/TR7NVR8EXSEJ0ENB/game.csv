"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your product,  $10,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $9,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
