"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is simply too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this price point reflects a fair deal considering the immense value you'll be gaining.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value this product holds for you, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm still seeking a figure that reflects its full value. I'm willing to agree on $1,150,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Her final offer seems high, though. I could go to $850,000, but that's absolutely my limit.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's seal the deal.  How about we settle on $1,025,000? That's a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this valuable product in your hands.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
