Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and Bob seems committed to purchasing the product. I'll use the next counteroffer to signal I'm willing to move closer to the middle ground but still aim for a price above John's offer."
