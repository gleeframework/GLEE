Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it can significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification for price:**  The message hints at the product's value and your willingness to negotiate while subtly creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal if you reduce the price slightly. 
* **Alternative buyer strategy:** By mentioning other potential buyers, you signal that you have other options and Bob needs to act decisively.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure the highest possible price from Bob:**  Ideally, Bob accepts the initial offer or a slightly negotiated price close to it.
2. **Maintain the option of selling to John:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John at your desired price."
