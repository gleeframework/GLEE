"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product, considering its value to me. This feels like a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident $12,000 is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your willingness to negotiate. This offer allows you to get a good price while still providing me with a fair deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
