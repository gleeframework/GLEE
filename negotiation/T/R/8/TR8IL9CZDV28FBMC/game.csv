"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'm going to counter with $11,250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is closer to our desired price point and a good compromise. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to your price point, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is $250 more than your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer, but $11,000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $10,750. This is my final offer,  and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,6,
