"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value is much higher. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value you've mentioned, I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This would allow for a good profit margin for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $700,000. Considering the value you've acknowledged it has, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm eager to finalize the deal, but I need to be confident that we're both getting a good outcome.",800000.0,Alice,5,
