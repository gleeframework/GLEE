"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it has immense potential and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has a lot of potential, $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite ready to meet that. Would you consider $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still not willing to meet my initial offer, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to counteroffer at $825,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. I'm getting closer to a point where I can agree to a deal. How about $780,000? I feel this reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not ready to accept $780,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $800,000.
