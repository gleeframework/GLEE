"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Confident but Flexible:** The message balances confidence in the product's value with a willingness to find a price that works for both parties.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The initial price of $1,150,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value than your minimum, leaving space for potential counteroffers while still aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, leaving us no profit. While it's tempting to take the sure $1,000,000, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. We have room to counter and try to meet somewhere in the middle. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is our safety net, but we should try to negotiate with Bob a bit more before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but my initial offer already took into account a significant discount. I'm open to finding a compromise, so I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the true worth of this product and its potential for you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Hold Firm (For Now):** We don't want to concede too much, too quickly. A $50,000 reduction shows flexibility but keeps us firmly above Bob's initial offer.
* **Reiterate Value:**  We're subtly reminding Bob about the potential benefits of the product, justifying the higher price point.
* **Gauging Seriousness:**  This counteroffer will help us understand how serious Bob is and how much negotiating room there really is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking $1,025,000 is a sweet spot for me. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now moving closer to a price we might consider, we still have some leverage. We're six rounds away from the end of the negotiation and Bob is clearly interested. A firm but fair counteroffer might push him closer to a more acceptable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're dropping our price by another $25,000, showing willingness to compromise but also setting a firm boundary.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** Presenting this as our ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and may encourage Bob to accept rather than risk the deal falling through. 
* **Profit Margin:** This price point still provides a reasonable profit margin above our minimum while being significantly closer to Bob's desired range.

**Important Note:**  We're getting close to the point where we might need to consider John's offer if Bob doesn't agree. With each round, the potential gains from prolonged negotiation diminish, and the risk of losing both offers increases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,050,000 is a significant profit above our $1,200,000 minimum. Holding out for more risks losing Bob altogether.
* **Middle Ground:** Bob has consistently moved towards our price point, and this offer represents a true middle ground. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have more rounds, the potential gains from further negotiation are likely small compared to the risk of Bob walking away.  

It's always tempting to push for more, but in negotiation, a good deal in hand is often better than the possibility of a slightly better deal that might never materialize."
