"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your asking price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. The product is truly unique and offers significant value. I'm willing to compromise, how about $1,050,000? I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both the product's value and your need for it. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
