"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle.  How about $1150000?  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're willing to come down from $1300000, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a deal that works for both of us, but $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1100000? This is a fair compromise that allows me to reach my desired price point and gives you a great deal on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
