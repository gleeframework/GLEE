Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market standards. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
