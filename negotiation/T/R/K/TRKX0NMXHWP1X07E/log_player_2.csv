Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

While $8,500 is getting closer to your budget, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $8,250.  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $8750. I'm confident that the product's value will justify this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is not budging from her price, and you're getting close to your limit of $8,000. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John to ensure you get the product within your budget."
