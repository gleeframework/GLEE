Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $10,500 is a good price, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $10,750? That would be a good compromise for both of us, and we could close the deal.
