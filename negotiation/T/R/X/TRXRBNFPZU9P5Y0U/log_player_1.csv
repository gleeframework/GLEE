"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move, aiming to establish a strong starting point for negotiation. It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John's offer of $800,000, so I can afford to be aggressive in the initial stages."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my safety net value, I believe I can achieve a higher price. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation while demonstrating my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my safety net value, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I believe I can get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll reject his offer and try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a compromise, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer and closer to my desired price.  We are getting close to my minimum value so I want to be careful not to go too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm running out of time to make a deal with him.  To avoid risking getting an even lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000, which is my safety net value. It's better to secure a guaranteed price than continue risking a potentially worse outcome."
