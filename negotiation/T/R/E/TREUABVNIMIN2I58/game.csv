"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $750,000 for the product. I think it's a bit overpriced, and I'd like to discuss further to see if we can meet in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $825,000?  That's still a great price for you, considering it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000, so how about $787,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $800,000? That's the absolute minimum I can go, and it's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",800000.0,Alice,5,
