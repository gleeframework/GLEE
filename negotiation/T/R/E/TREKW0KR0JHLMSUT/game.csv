"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to get closer to my initial offer of $900,000. How about $1,000,000? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
