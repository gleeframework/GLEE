Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable, and I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,450,000. I think it could be a real game-changer for you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer. He might be willing to pay a bit more than his initial perceived value.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives us leverage. We're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost. 

**The Strategy:**

This offer is a strong opening move. It positions the product as highly valuable while still giving Bob a (slim) incentive to accept and avoid losing the opportunity."
