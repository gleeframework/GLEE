Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potential profit beyond my minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than an expense. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

By setting the initial price at $2,000,000, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price significantly higher than my minimum. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always rely on John to meet my baseline valuation."
