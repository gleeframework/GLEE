{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm happy to offer it at the price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly downwards.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While I could start higher,  it's generally good practice to present a price that feels reasonable to both parties. This avoids alienating Bob and potentially losing the sale.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  This price is significantly higher than my backup offer from John ($10,000), ensuring a good profit."
