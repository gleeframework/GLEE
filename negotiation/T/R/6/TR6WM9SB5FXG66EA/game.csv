"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to make this deal work. This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can do $950,000. That's a fair offer considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.  Think about it â€“ this product can generate significant returns for your business, making this a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
