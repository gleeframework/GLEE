It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  Since you don't know how much the product is worth to Alice, you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move that shows I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if necessary.  It will also give me a good idea of how much Alice is willing to compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can get a better price.  It's important to remember that we have a limited number of rounds, so I need to be strategic about my offers."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but it's still lower than Alice's last offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not willing to go over my desired price yet.  It's possible Alice might be willing to meet me at $600,000. If not, we're getting closer to a price we can both agree on."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my maximum price, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, so it's important to make sure I'm getting the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to go up to $650,000, but I'm not going any higher.  If Alice doesn't accept, I'll have to buy from John. This is a high-stakes situation, and I need to make sure I'm getting the best possible deal."

We're at the final round and Alice is back to her original price.  It's clear she's not willing to budge further.  I've already exhausted my counteroffer options and I'm getting close to my maximum price. To avoid losing the opportunity to buy the product, I'm going to buy from John.  It's not ideal, but it's the best option available in this situation."
