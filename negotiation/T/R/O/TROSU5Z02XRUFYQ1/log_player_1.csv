Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,500,000) and significantly higher than what it's worth to Bob ($1,200,000).  This is a bold opening move, designed to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Sets the bar high:** It immediately signals that I'm not desperate for a sale and am aiming for a high price. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** By offering a price above my minimum, I have room to compromise if Bob counteroffers.
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  There's a chance that Bob may value the product more than he initially stated or is willing to pay a premium for it.

**Next steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll use his counteroffer to assess his willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he accepts, I've secured a profitable sale. If negotiations stall or seem unproductive, I'll switch to John, who is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,500,000, I'm still not willing to accept it. Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, so there's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John as a safety net:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, which gives me leverage during negotiations with Bob.

**Next steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000.  I'll carefully consider his willingness to negotiate and the possibility of selling to John if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm  lowering my price from $1,700,000 to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still above his last offer and my minimum price, leaving room for further negotiation.

**Why this approach?**

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates my flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** A counteroffer keeps the conversation going and increases the chances of reaching an agreement. 
* **Strategic positioning:** By offering $1,600,000, I'm still in a strong position. If Bob rejects, I can make a final counteroffer before resorting to John.

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully monitor Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've achieved a successful negotiation. If he rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and determine if a final compromise is possible or if I should sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I've shown willingness to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that low, especially considering John is willing to buy at my minimum price.

**Why sell to John?**

* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price, guaranteeing a profitable transaction.
* **Time and effort:**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better result, and it would take more time and energy.
* **Risk mitigation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him refusing further offers, leaving me with no buyer and a lower price than I could get from John.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm disappointed not to secure a higher price from Bob, selling to John is the most sensible decision at this point. It minimizes risk and ensures a profitable outcome."
