"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low for me. How about $1,050,000?  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to see you moving closer to my desired price, $975,000 is still a little below where I need to be. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $1,012,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can you consider this offer?",990000.0,Bob,6,
