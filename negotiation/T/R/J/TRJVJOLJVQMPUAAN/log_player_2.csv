Given its worth to you at $800,000, this offer provides a unique opportunity for both parties to benefit. Please consider this proposal carefully and let me know if you have any questions or need further information. I look forward to potentially working with you on this exciting opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer might hold value for her, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your acceptable range, or you can proceed with purchasing from John at a lower cost."
