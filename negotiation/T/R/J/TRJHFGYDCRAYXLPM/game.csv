"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering my desired return on investment.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial offer reflected the product's unique potential and the significant return you would experience. To move things forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and demonstrates my willingness to find a fair deal.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I respect your position and am willing to make another move. To find common ground, I propose a price of $1,750,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my initial asking price and underscores my commitment to closing this deal.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're making progress, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm feeling confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I'm hoping this will be a price that we can both agree on.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
