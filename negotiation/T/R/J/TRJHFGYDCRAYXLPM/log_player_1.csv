"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** We start significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and our minimum. This provides room for negotiation while anchoring the price high in Bob's mind. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential"" and focusing on the ""return on investment"" aims to justify the high asking price, even though it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language ""initially proposing"" and ""starting point"" signals that we are open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  Starting high leaves space for concessions while aiming for a price closer to our ideal outcome.
2. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will indicate how eager he is to buy and how much we can push for. 
3. **Maintain the option of John:** We haven't committed to Bob yet, keeping John as a safety net if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering my desired return on investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,100,000 is only slightly above his perceived value and significantly below our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer suggests he's interested but trying to anchor the negotiation low. There's a considerable gap to bridge, but it's early in the process.
* **John as a safety net:** We still have the option to walk away and sell to John for our desired price if negotiations stall or become unreasonable. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we're serious about a higher price while keeping the door open for further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial offer reflected the product's unique potential and the significant return you would experience. To move things forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and demonstrates my willingness to find a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We decrease our price by $250,000, a substantial amount designed to show flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Holding Firm Above Minimum:** We stay well above our $1,500,000 minimum and closer to our initial offer, maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Reiterating Value:** We reiterate the product's value proposition to justify the still-high price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low.
* **Encouraging Reciprocity:**  By stating this concession ""demonstrates my willingness to find a fair deal,"" we subtly pressure Bob to make a similarly significant move towards our position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** Bob increased his offer by $200,000, which is positive movement. However, $1,300,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **More room to negotiate:**  We are in Round 4 of 10. While we don't want to drag this on unnecessarily, there's still time to try and bridge the gap. Bob's incremental increases suggest he's willing to negotiate further. 
* **John remains an option:** We don't have to settle for less than our minimum. John's standing offer provides leverage and security.

We will continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to our target while being prepared to walk away and sell to John if needed."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I respect your position and am willing to make another move. To find common ground, I propose a price of $1,750,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my initial asking price and underscores my commitment to closing this deal."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Price Reduction:** We lower our offer by a substantial $250,000, bringing it closer to the midpoint between our last offer and Bob's counter. This signals significant flexibility while staying above our $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise and Deal Closure:**  We highlight this as a ""significant compromise"" to emphasize our movement and incentivize Bob to reciprocate. We also express our strong ""commitment to closing this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage a final decision from Bob. 

This offer aims to:

1. **Entice Bob's acceptance:** The large price reduction and emphasis on compromise could be compelling for Bob to accept. 
2. **Maintain a strong position:** If Bob counters, we are still comfortably above our minimum and can gauge his seriousness based on his next move.
3. **Manage time:** We are now past the halfway point of the rounds, making each decision more critical. We need to move towards a close or be prepared to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're making progress, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm feeling confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I'm hoping this will be a price that we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Acceptable Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is above our $1,500,000 minimum. While not ideal, it represents a substantial profit.
* **Positive Negotiation Trajectory:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest. His latest jump of $150,000 demonstrates a willingness to meet us closer to the middle ground. 
* **Time Considerations:** We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation. Continuing to push risks a stalemate or Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal with less risk.

While we could try to negotiate a slightly higher price, the likelihood of gaining a significant amount over $1,450,000 is diminishing. Accepting Bob's offer at this stage balances profit, risk, and the time invested in the negotiation."
