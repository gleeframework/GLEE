"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
