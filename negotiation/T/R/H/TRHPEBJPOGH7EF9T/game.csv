"Hello Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's something you value at $100, and I'm offering it to you for $120.  This is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer is a compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. Can we do $97.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $101.25 for the product.  This is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. Let me know what you think.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get as close to $100 as possible. Can we do $100.50? I think that's a fair compromise considering our previous offers.",100.5,Bob,6,
