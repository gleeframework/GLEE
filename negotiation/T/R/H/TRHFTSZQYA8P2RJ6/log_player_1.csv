Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is the absolute minimum you're willing to accept.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer significantly. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
