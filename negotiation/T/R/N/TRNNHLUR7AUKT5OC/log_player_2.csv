Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to hear you're willing to come up a bit. However, $8,750 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy from John. You've negotiated down to $8,875, but it's still slightly more than you're willing to spend. At this point, you can save $875 by buying from John, which is a better deal than continuing to negotiate."
