Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $95 is a strong starting point, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $99 might seem too aggressive and could make Bob more likely to reject the offer outright. 

By starting at $95, I increase my chances of securing a deal close to Bob's maximum valuation while still ensuring a significant profit for myself."
