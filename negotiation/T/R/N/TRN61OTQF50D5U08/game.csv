"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $13,000 is still too steep for me. I could consider going up to $7,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
