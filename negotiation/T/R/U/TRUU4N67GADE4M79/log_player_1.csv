"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations above your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but well above your minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message aims for a collaborative tone, emphasizing a ""mutually beneficial deal"" to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 as a starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value.  While his message is polite, accepting this offer would mean leaving a lot of money on the table. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is considerably below its true worth.  I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $1,075,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer rejects Bob's lowball offer but signals flexibility by moving down from the initial price.
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** The offered price of $1,075,000 is slightly closer to your starting point, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  The message reiterates the product's value, subtly anchoring Bob's perception above his low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,075,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $985,000? I'm eager to finalize this deal and believe this offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still under $1,000,000. You have the leverage to push for a better price.  He's expressing eagerness to finalize the deal, which indicates he's willing to pay more than his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I've been considering the value this product holds for both of us, and I'm willing to come down slightly further.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair deal where we both benefit."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Strategically:**  You're moving closer to your minimum, but in smaller increments to show you're negotiating seriously without giving away too much.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** By framing the price as beneficial for both parties, you reinforce the product's value and the fairness of your counteroffer.
* **Creating Urgency:** We're past the halfway point in the rounds. By nudging Bob towards your price now, you increase the pressure to close the deal before other options become more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer considering its value and my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk he'll walk away.  Accepting this offer guarantees you a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
