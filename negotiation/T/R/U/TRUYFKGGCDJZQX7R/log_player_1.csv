Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit margin for me.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob while positioning the price as fair. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed backup offer from John."
