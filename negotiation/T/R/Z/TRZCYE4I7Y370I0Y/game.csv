"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While the product does seem great, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at the moment. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still gives you a good value and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
