"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $100 is better than John's offer of $120, but it's still more than the product is worth to you.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John as a last resort."
