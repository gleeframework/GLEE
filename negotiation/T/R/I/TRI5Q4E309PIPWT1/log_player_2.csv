(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes my willingness to negotiate and sets a clear target price.  It's also a significant discount from the price John is offering, which I'll use as leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I believe there's still room for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying below my budget.  This counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiation and hopefully incentivizes Alice to meet me closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still determined to get a better price. It's getting more tempting to buy from John at $1,000,000, but I'm not giving up yet.  One more counteroffer might be enough to seal the deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm finally offering Alice my maximum price. This should be appealing to her since it's closer to her desired price and likely higher than what she'd get from other potential buyers.  If she rejects, I'm ready to move on to John and close the deal."
