"Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1250000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1375000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1375000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1312500? This seems like a fair price for both of us.",1312500.0,Bob,4,
