"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's relatively close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Building Rapport:** My message is friendly and aims to establish a connection with Bob, making him feel valued as a potential customer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering a price lower than my minimum, I leave room for negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  I want to maximize my profit, and selling to John for $80 would be less than what I believe I can get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being interested.  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still standing firm on my minimum profit margin. $85 represents a compromise that should be appealing to both of us.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is still friendly and open to negotiation, aiming to keep the conversation productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $78?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for Better Offer:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. He's shown interest, and the negotiation has moved towards my desired range.
* **Time is a Factor:**  While I could sell to John for $80, I have more time (6 rounds left) to try and secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point. $78 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm willing to go down to $82.  That feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 82}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, showing that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not giving in completely.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  I'm still above my minimum price point, but not by much, suggesting that I'm close to my limit."
