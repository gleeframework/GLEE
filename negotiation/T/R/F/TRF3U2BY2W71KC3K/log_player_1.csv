Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum but not too high to scare Bob away immediately.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is more than your minimum, it's still lower than what you'd like to make.  It's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $112.50 is still below your initial asking price, it's higher than your minimum and closer to your desired price.  You've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and the risk of continuing to bargain with Bob is that he might walk away.  It's better to take this offer and secure a sale."
