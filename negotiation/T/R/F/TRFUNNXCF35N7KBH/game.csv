"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. I believe it's a good price considering the value I'll get from it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my desired price. To show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects both the product's value and the potential we have for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 still leaves a considerable gap.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm offering the product for $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, but I need you to meet me at that price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Bob,6,
