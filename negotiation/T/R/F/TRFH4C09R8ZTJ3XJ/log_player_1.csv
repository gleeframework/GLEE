"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if I can bridge the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,800 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum than John's offer, I'm still hopeful I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and avoid further back and forth."", ""product_price"": 10900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $11,500,  $10,700 is significantly better than selling to John for $10,000. With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids further back-and-forth negotiation."
