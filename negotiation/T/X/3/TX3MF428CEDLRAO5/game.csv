"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $935,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value. Let's close this deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not comfortable with $935,000. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can agree on it.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go down to $930,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",930000.0,Alice,7,
