# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can potentially get the product for a lower price. You know John is willing to sell for $1,000,000.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate with Alice to get closer to that price."
