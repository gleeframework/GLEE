"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get the best deal possible. I'm happy to consider your product at $1,050,000.  This price would still give you a good return, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle, I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still not quite there.  How about $1,060,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's close this deal!",1060000.0,Bob,4,
