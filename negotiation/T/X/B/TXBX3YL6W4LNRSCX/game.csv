"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $70? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can reach a fair price.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $85? I think that's a good compromise, and I'm really eager to buy this product.",85.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $92.50. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into finding a buyer.",92.5,Alice,5,
