"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider selling your product for $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair return on my investment.",800000.0,Alice,3,
