I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This gives Bob a decent margin to potentially negotiate down while still allowing me to make a profit beyond my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll be keeping a close eye on his response and be prepared to counter if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at this price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial $18,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $16,500. This is a compromise, offering a lower price than my initial offer but still leaving some room for profit. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a reasonable step towards an agreement."

While I would prefer a higher price,  Bob's offer of $16,000 is a fair compromise.  It's significantly higher than John's offer and only $500 lower than my last counteroffer. I'm willing to accept and move forward with the sale."
