"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and Bob has shown interest. I will try to meet him halfway in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is a bit below what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. Can you consider this revised offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a higher amount. We're both willing to compromise, and I have several rounds left.  I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to $1,300,000 to see if we can find a meeting point."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,250,000 still doesn't quite reflect the value I see in this unique offering.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer to a deal, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I have four rounds left, so I'll make one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. While I appreciate your latest offer, $1,225,000 isn't quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time at $1,275,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob and I are stuck. We both seem to be at our final offers, and I'm unwilling to go lower than $1,275,000. I only have two rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a good outcome.  It guarantees a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
