Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that works for you. She went up in price from her previous offer, indicating she might be getting frustrated or trying a new tactic.  You're better off taking John's offer of $12,000 and not risking further negotiation."
