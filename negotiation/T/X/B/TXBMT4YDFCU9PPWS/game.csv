"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite ready to meet that price. Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,5,
