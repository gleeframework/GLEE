Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too close to the product's true value, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price.

It seems like Alice is no longer negotiating in good faith. Her offer has gone up from $1,025,000 to $1,075,000. This suggests she's trying to push the price higher, knowing you have a budget.  It's unlikely she'll come down significantly in the remaining rounds.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $1,500,000, even though it's not ideal, rather than risk ending up with an even worse deal from Alice."
