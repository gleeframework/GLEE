"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would you be open to that?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I think there's still room to meet in the middle. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too close to the product's true value, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you a price of $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's worth and my costs.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
