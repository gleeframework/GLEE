"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a little high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide for me.  If you're willing to consider $700,000, I'm ready to make a deal.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $725,000? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $725,000, which would be $737,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",737500.0,Alice,7,
