# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $725,000, which would be $737,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

Alice is clearly very slowly moving towards your price.  While you *might* be able to get the price a little lower, the difference is no longer that significant, and risking the deal for a potentially small saving isn't worth it at this point."
