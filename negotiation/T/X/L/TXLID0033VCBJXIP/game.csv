"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your position, but I believe the value this product brings to the table warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise and within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
