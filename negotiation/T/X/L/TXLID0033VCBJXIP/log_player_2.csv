"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance you can get a better deal, and it's worth exploring before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your position, but I believe the value this product brings to the table warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. Although it's a slight improvement, it's still not within my acceptable range. I will try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price.  If not, I'll go with John's offer."
