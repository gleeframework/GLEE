"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This price reflects my assessment of the product's worth and aligns better with my financial capacity.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is significant and $2,000,000 is a fair reflection of that.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this revised offer represents a win-win scenario.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
