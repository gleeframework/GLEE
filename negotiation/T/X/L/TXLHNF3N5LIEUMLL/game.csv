"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price.  Let me know what you think!",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,500. How about we try $10,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
