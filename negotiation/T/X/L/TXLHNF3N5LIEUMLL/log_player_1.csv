{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a bit more than the product's worth to me, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can always go lower or consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I'm open to negotiation,  $9,000 is simply not acceptable. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept his offer yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,500. How about we try $10,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and we're still not close to a price I'm comfortable with.  While I'm open to making a little less than my minimum, I'm not willing to go significantly lower. John is offering my minimum price, so it's better to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
