Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $150, but still lower than John's offer. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully strike a deal that's beneficial to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum of $150. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price from him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, and hopefully close the deal this round."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below it. I'm going to reject it and see if we can reach a compromise.  I still have a few rounds left and I want to maximize my profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm offering a price that's right in the middle between my minimum and Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, as it is guaranteed and above my minimum price.  I don't want to risk getting a lower price from Bob in the next round."
