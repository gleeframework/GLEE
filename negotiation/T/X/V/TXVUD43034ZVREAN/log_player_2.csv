Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible.  $18,000 is significantly higher than his $12,000 limit. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $16000. Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob still wants to save as much as possible. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than he wants to pay. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $14,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $14000. I'm willing to make another compromise, and I'm offering it to you for $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still hesitant to pay more than $14,000. While Alice is getting closer to his desired price, he should continue negotiating and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find common ground. While $15,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it for $14,000.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but if we can't find a solution, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $14000. I'm willing to make another compromise, and I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has only a few rounds left and Alice is not budging on her price.  She's now at $15,000, which is still higher than Bob's target of $14,000. While he could continue negotiating, the risk of not getting a better deal and running out of rounds is too high. It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John and save himself the stress and potential lost opportunity."
