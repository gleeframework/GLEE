"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to pay, which is still less than my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired price without wasting time on further haggling."
