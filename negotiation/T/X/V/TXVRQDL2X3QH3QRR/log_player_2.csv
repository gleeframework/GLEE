"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $8,000. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts by acknowledging Alice's offer and expresses interest in the product. It then proposes a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's budget.  This approach aims to show Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $8,000. Although it's closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,250, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $8,250 is a compromise between his ideal price of $8,000 and Alice's offer of $8,500. This shows Alice that Bob is willing to pay a fair price, but still wants to save some money. By mentioning ""common ground"", Bob tries to encourage Alice to see their negotiation as a collaborative process, making her more likely to accept his offer."
