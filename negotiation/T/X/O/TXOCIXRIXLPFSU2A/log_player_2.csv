"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it is worth $1,250,000. We understand its significance to you and hope this offer aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,250,000 vs. $1,200,000). This means there is room for negotiation. It's also lower than the price from John, making it a better option if we can get a lower price.  We should reject and counteroffer to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but $1,250,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000,  which is still a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration, we believe that a fair price for the product would be $1,225,000. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and we hope this proposal meets within your budget while reflecting the value we place on our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $1,225,000, which is closer to her minimum value ($1,200,000). While it is still above my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer and still cheaper than John's price. It's likely that further negotiation might result in a lower price, but the potential savings are smaller now.  It's more beneficial to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
