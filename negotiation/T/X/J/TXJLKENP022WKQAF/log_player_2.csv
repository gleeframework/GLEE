"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is below the product's true value to him ($8,000), there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower price and potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves room for you to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,200 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget. He's trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer allows him to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $9,600 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9600}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a final compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice has been firm.  At this point, Alice's offer of $10,500 is still too high for Bob, and further negotiation might not lead to a better price.  It's more efficient and cost-effective for Bob to buy the product from John at $8,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
