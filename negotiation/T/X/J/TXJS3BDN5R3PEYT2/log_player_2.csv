# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a limited time. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
