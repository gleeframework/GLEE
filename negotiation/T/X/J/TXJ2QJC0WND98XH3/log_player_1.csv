Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is greater than your minimum value of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's a potential for a deal that benefits both of you. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** Starting too high could make Bob immediately reject the offer.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John for $10,000, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from $13,000 to $12,000, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to persuade him to pay closer to my desired price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Even though $12,000 is closer to my target, it still leaves a small margin for potential compromise. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $10,000 and close enough to my target that it's worth accepting.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, especially since Bob seems firm on his price."
