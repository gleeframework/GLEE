It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can get a better price than $13,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product. What do you say?

You can still try to get a lower price. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further."
