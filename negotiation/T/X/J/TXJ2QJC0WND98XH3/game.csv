"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
