Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $775,000 for the product. This price includes an extended warranty and priority customer support for a limited time. I believe this offer provides a good balance between our interests.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close, but Alice is still above our backup price with John. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting very close.  I'm ready to close the deal if we can agree on a price. Would you be willing to come down to $760,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 760000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer attempts to split the difference between Alice's current offer ($775,000) and our target price ($750,000). It shows willingness to negotiate but also puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to continue haggling or secure the sale."
