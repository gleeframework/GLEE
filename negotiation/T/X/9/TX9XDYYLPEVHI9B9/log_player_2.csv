"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away. This might push Alice to lower her price closer to her own valuation of $800,000. If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $1,500,000, which is still within your budget."
