""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher profit than John's offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, he may be willing to pay more if he perceives it as valuable and a good deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The safety net of John's offer ensures Alice won't be forced to accept a low price from Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** It's unknown how much Bob is willing to pay above his $8,000 valuation. 
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer opens the door for negotiation. Bob may counter-offer, and Alice can then decide to lower the price or stick to her minimum."
