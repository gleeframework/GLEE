Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $80 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $100? This is a great product, and I think it's worth it."", ""product_price"": 100}

$90 is still a bit low, but it's getting closer. I'm not ready to sell yet, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can work out a price that's fair for both of us."
