The product is worth more to Alice than it is to you, so there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to try and get a lower price."

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and reflects the fact that the product is worth less to me than it is to her.  It's a starting point for negotiation, and we'll see how Alice responds."

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still above my desired price.  I'm going to continue negotiating."

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,450,000. This is a more moderate move than my first offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to a deal."
