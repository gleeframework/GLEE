"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm happy to offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit higher than my minimum, but I'm hoping to get a good deal. I'm being friendly and confident in my message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with $80, I want to see if I can get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price slightly closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $85.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, it's a good price and I'm not sure I can get any more from Bob. I'm also getting close to the point where I may have to sell to John for less, so I'll take the deal and avoid risking a lower price."
