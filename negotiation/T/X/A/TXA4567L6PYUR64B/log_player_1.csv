{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $150 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is more than your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for him to counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable price:** It's not too high that Bob will immediately reject it, but it's still a good profit for you. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $120, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below the price I want to get.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $105?  That's still a good price for you, considering you value the product at $150."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not comfortable with $105. How about we try $95? That's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $95 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's much better than selling to John for $80."
