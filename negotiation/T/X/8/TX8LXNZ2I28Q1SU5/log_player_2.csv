Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and the potential benefits it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900000 is simply too low for me to consider. The product is worth much more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This is a significant discount from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach a deal.
