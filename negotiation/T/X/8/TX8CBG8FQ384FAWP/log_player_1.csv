Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While not going into great detail (as we don't know what the product is), hinting at the value to Bob encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Clear Expectation:** By stating you believe it's worth at least $100, you set a price floor in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:** This assumes a single offer scenario. In a real negotiation, there might be multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers."
