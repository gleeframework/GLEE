"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $120 is less than your maximum price, you can get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her product's value of $80. You always have the fallback option of buying from John for $150."
