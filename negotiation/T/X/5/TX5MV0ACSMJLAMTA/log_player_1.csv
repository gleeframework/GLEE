{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire [product description]. I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,200,000 reflects its worth.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This allows for a considerable profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial solution.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you've placed on the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. There are still rounds left and I believe I can secure a better deal, potentially even closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and come up on your offer. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $975,000. This would ensure a significant profit for you while also allowing me to secure a fair return on my investment.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, $975,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you've placed on the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I believe I can still push for a better price, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.  There are still a few rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $925,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $920,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  With only two rounds remaining, the likelihood of getting a higher offer from Bob is slim.  Therefore, selling to John for $800,000 ensures I don't lose out on any profit and guarantees a sale."
