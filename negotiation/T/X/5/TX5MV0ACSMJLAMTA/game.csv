"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire [product description]. I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,200,000 reflects its worth.

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This allows for a considerable profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial solution.

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and come up on your offer. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $975,000. This would ensure a significant profit for you while also allowing me to secure a fair return on my investment.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, $975,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $925,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows for a substantial profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,7,
