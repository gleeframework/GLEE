Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is moving closer to our desired price point. It's worth seeing if we can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm prepared to make this work for both of us. Let's settle at $925,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a strong position:** We're making a smaller concession this round, signaling that we're nearing our bottom line. 
* **Introduce a sense of urgency:** Stating ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Target a price above Bob's valuation:** We're still aiming for a price that exceeds Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $905,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $905,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $905,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $905,000 is a significant profit margin. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely.
* **Limited Upside:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher. His increments are getting smaller, and we've established a firm stance.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means we receive the payment sooner. There's inherent value in quicker transactions."
