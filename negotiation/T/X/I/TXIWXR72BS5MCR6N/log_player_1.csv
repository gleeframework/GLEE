Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You know you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you don't want to accept anything less from Bob.
* **Starting high:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Leaving Bob room to profit:** While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay more if he sees potential for profit, hence the offer above $15,000. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The message also aims to understand Bob's potential interest and encourage him to engage in negotiation. 

By starting high, Alice maximizes her potential profit while still leaving a chance for Bob to make a deal that's beneficial for him."
