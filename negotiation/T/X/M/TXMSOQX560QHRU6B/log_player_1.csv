Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You don't actually know how much Bob values the product, so you can't use that information directly.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible. Offering it for that price outright might scare Bob away. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers and a limited-time offer, you encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a price higher than he might if he had unlimited time to negotiate.

**This strategy aims to find a balance between:**

* **Not undervaluing the product:**  You know John will buy it for $1,500,000, so you don't want to go much lower.
* **Making the offer attractive enough for Bob:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price might be enough to entice him while still securing a significant profit."
