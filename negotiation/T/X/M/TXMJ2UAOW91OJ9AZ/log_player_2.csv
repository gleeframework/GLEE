Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $6,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let's work together to find a solution.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 simply won't work for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  How about $8,500?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm also trying to get fair value for my product.  I'm willing to go down to $8,250, which is a significant compromise on my part.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider my other options. Remember, I'm confident this product will be worth more than $8,000 to you in the long run. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to meet Bob's price ceiling of $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a better outcome for Bob.  He has a guaranteed option with John at $8,000, which meets his needs and saves him money compared to Alice's latest offer."
