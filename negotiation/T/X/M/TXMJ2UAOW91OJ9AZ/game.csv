"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would you be open to something closer to that range?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $6,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let's work together to find a solution.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $7,500? That would work well for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 simply won't work for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  How about $8,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Remember, this product offers [mention specific benefits/value for Bob].  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $8,500 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $8,000? That's my final offer, as I know I can get it for that price elsewhere.  But, I'd prefer to work with you if possible.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm also trying to get fair value for my product.  I'm willing to go down to $8,250, which is a significant compromise on my part.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider my other options. Remember, I'm confident this product will be worth more than $8,000 to you in the long run.",8250.0,Alice,7,
