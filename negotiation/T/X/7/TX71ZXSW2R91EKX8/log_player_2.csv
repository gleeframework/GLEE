"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's lower than the product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down further to close the deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still slightly above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's becoming clear that we may not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Therefore, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further rounds of negotiation.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and saves time."
