"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
