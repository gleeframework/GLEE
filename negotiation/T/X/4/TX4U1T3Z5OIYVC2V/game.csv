"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $1,375,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $1,337,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time and offer $1,350,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Alice,9,
