"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. You have no information about the product's value to Alice, so there's a possibility you could get it for less. By rejecting the offer, you can explore the possibility of a lower price without risking losing the opportunity altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Would you be willing to consider $8,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
