Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point, and I'm going to keep a few things in mind:

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $8,000, otherwise, I'll sell to John.
* **Bob's unknown value:** I don't know how much Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm starting high, but I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Would you be willing to consider $8000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, so I'll accept it.  I'm not sure how much more he'd be willing to pay, and it's better to secure the sale at this point."
