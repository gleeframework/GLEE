Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. This product could be valuable to me, but your asking price is a little too high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum and closer to John's offer. I should counter, but stay closer to my original price to gauge his flexibility.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, the value of this product to you is undeniable, and $1,100,000  doesn't reflect that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This seems like a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll reap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet halfway at $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob is clearly interested and negotiating, but  $1,200,000 is still a good profit margin. I'll accept to avoid risking the deal entirely.
