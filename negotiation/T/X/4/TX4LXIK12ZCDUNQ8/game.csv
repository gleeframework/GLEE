"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will greatly benefit you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. This product could be valuable to me, but your asking price is a little too high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, the value of this product to you is undeniable, and $1,100,000  doesn't reflect that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This seems like a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll reap.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet halfway at $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
