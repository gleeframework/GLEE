Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, the value of this product to you is undeniable, and $1,100,000  doesn't reflect that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This seems like a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll reap.
