"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Leaving John as Leverage:** The option to sell to John for my desired price gives me a strong alternative if negotiations don't go well. I won't mention John explicitly, but his presence influences my strategy. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message frames the product's ""worth and potential,"" subtly nudging Bob towards a higher valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  His message acknowledges the product's value, suggesting he might be willing to go higher. I'll counter with a price closer to my starting point to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the significant value this product brings, and after careful consideration, I can offer it to you for $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, the new price remains significantly above Bob's offer and closer to my desired outcome.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message reiterates my belief in the product's value while positioning the counteroffer as a mutually beneficial compromise. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By staying engaged in the negotiation, I'm signaling my interest in closing a deal with Bob while keeping the pressure on him to justify his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, we're still a significant distance from a price I find truly acceptable. His message suggests he's getting closer to his upper limit, but I'm not convinced yet. I'll make another strategic concession to encourage him while still aiming for a higher final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. To show my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,310,000.  This is a significant move on my end, reflecting my understanding of your budget concerns while ensuring the product's value is recognized."", 
""product_price"": 1310000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calculated Compromise:** I'm making another price reduction, but this time it's smaller, signaling that I'm nearing my bottom line. This keeps the negotiation moving but puts the onus on Bob to reciprocate.
* **Highlighting Concessions:** My message emphasizes that I've made significant moves, subtly implying it's now Bob's turn to make a substantial jump.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  The new price is still considerably above Bob's offer, reflecting my goal to maximize profit.  I'm aware that continued negotiation carries the risk of losing Bob, but I believe he's invested enough to consider a strong counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Deal:**  Bob's offer is now significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could potentially push for more, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential reward at this point. 
* **Limited Upside:** Bob's incremental increases suggest he's nearing his maximum. I doubt further negotiation will yield a significantly better offer.
* **Time Value:**  We've spent six rounds negotiating. Accepting now secures a very good price and allows me to move forward."
