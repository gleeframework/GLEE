"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my target. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $7,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $8,000. I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? I believe this is still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with a price that's still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but also maintains my goal of getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to continue negotiating. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $7,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $8,200? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise. This should encourage him to accept, while still ensuring I get a price that's above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not quite ready to sell for that price. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $8,000. I believe I can get a better offer from Bob with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? It's a fair price that's right in the middle of our last two offers and would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm offering a price that is my minimum, and therefore a good deal for me. This is a last attempt to get a deal with Bob before selling to John. I hope this will convince him to accept the offer."
