"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $7,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? I believe this is still a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $7,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $8,200? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? It's a fair price that's right in the middle of our last two offers and would be a win-win for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,7,
