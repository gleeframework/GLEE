{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair compromise:** It's higher than Bob's valuation, but lower than your minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust your price if Bob makes a counteroffer.  
* **It shows you're serious about selling to Bob:** You're not starting at your minimum, which shows that you're willing to negotiate. 

**Remember:** If Bob rejects your offer, you can always switch to John, who is willing to pay your minimum. This gives you leverage throughout the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is a significant sum, it's far below my minimum of $1,000,000. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept such a low offer at this point.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. If we can't reach a mutually agreeable price, I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $900,000.
* **Fairness:**  $825,000 is a reasonable compromise that's still closer to my desired range.
* **Motivation:** I'm emphasizing the importance of a fair deal for both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to meet me halfway.

If Bob still rejects my counteroffer, I will consider selling to John for $1,000,000, as my minimum price is $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000, which would be $787,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, his offer of $787,500 is still significantly below my minimum of $1,000,000.  I am not comfortable accepting this offer.  

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range.  However, if we cannot reach an agreement, I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  I have a backup plan, and I won't settle for a price that is too far below my minimum."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $787,500 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price again, demonstrating that I want to reach an agreement with Bob.
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting a final compromise price,  $800,000, which is close to my minimum.
* **Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing that this price would be beneficial for both of us. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will accept John's offer of $1,000,000.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go below $800,000."
