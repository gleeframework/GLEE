"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000, which would be $787,500. Can you consider this offer?",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $787,500 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",800000.0,Alice,5,
