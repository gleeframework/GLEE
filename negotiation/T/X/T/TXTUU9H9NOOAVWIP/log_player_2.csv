"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a great chance to get a significant edge in the market. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You can get the product for less from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
