"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is fair given its value and my budget.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
