"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Let's start our negotiation at $9,500. Looking forward to your response!

You have three options:

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $10,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
