Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $950,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for him to see it as a potentially worthwhile investment.
* **Confident Negotiation:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing my minimum acceptable price. This positions me strongly in the negotiation. 

**It's a gamble:** Bob might reject the offer, leading me to the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. However, the potential for an extra $50,000 makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
