"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value, and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $900,000? This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still above my target price. Let's try $875,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's settle at $890,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that he'll end up paying more from John.  At this point, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price within his budget."
