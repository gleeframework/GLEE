"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value, and I'm open to discussing further.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $900,000? This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still above my target price. Let's try $875,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's settle at $890,000. This is my final offer.",890000.0,Alice,5,
