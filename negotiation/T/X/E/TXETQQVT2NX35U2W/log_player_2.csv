"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

While $17,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  He should continue negotiating and try to get the price closer to his limit."
