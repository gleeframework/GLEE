"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $2000000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $1200000. This would allow me to comfortably add it to my collection while staying within my financial limits. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1700000. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While $1700000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $1400000. This would make it a worthwhile purchase for me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
