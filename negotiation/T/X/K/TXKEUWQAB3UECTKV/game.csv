"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price for a product worth much more, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves a good profit margin for both of us. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe we can find a middle ground. How about $900,000? It's a bit higher than my initial budget, but it's closer to your offer and within my range.",900000.0,Bob,4,
