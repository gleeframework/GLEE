"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to do $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get to a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much on the deal. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
