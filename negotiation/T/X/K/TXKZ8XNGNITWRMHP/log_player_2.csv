"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're looking for a product worth no more than $10,000 to you. 
* **Negotiation is worth a try.** There are 10 rounds, so you have time to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $8,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  This offer is a considerable drop from Alice's price, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Within Budget:** This offer is within your $10,000 limit, but still leaves room for Alice to counter without dropping below your value threshold.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and encouraging tone, leaving the door open for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm feeling a bit more confident at $9,500. If we can find a way to bridge the gap, I think we can finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

* **John's offer is a strong safety net.** If you can't get a better price, you have a guaranteed option with John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm still a little hesitant at $10,500.  Would you consider $10,200? This is my absolute limit, but I'm confident we can strike a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're really close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10200, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's usually worth $1000, absolutely free. This way, you'll get the product and the service package for the price of $10200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within budget.** The $10,200 price is within your maximum value.
* **Extra Value.**  The free service package worth $1,000 adds value to the deal.
* **Limited Time.**  With only 3 rounds left, it's risky to continue negotiating, especially with John's offer as a backup.

This deal offers a good price and additional value, making it worthwhile to accept and finalize the purchase."
