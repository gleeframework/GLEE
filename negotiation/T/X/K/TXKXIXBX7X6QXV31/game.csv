"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $850,000 is my absolute bottom line. Let's find common ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I also need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is a significant concession on my part. Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Alice,5,
