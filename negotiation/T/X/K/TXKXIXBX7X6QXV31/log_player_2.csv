"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $850,000 is my absolute bottom line. Let's find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, it's still above our ideal budget. We're in round 3, so there's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a firm budget.  Would you consider $725,000?  That's a significant move on my part."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference (almost):**  Alice came down to $850,000.  This counteroffer is a bit more than halfway between her last price and our previous offer. It shows willingness to compromise but holds firm on the budget.
* **Firm but polite:**  The language emphasizes our budget constraint while remaining respectful of Alice's position.
* **Leaving room:** We're still in early rounds. This offer leaves space for further negotiation if Alice completely rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I also need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is a significant concession on my part. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our ideal price point. There's no point in rejecting and risking her raising the price again, especially since we can get it for the same amount from John."
