"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's still a great opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I can't go quite that low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This ensures a win-win for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
