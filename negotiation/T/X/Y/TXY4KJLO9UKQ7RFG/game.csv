"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it would bring to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $7,500 is significantly below its true value and my minimum selling price. I could consider $9,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and is a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
