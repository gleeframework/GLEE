{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation but still securing a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, considering you value it at $8,000 and I'm willing to pay up to $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $8,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That way we both get a fair price, and I can avoid having to sell to John."", ""product_price"": 9000}
