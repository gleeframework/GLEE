"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm starting with a price of $20000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is still a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $16,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on $10,000.  If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to finding a middle ground, but $10000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13000. This is a fair price for the value I'm offering, and it's a significant step towards your offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is coming down in price, but $13,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a few more rounds before potentially going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value we're both looking for in this transaction."", ""product_price"": 10000}
