"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm starting with a price of $20000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is still a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on $10000.  If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to finding a middle ground, but $10000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13000. This is a fair price for the value I'm offering, and it's a significant step towards your offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value we're both looking for in this transaction.",10000.0,Bob,6,
