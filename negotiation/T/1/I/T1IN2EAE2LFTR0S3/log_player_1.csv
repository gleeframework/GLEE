Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it below that is pointless. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting Alice closer to her desired profit.
* **Backup Offer:** Alice has a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John. If Bob rejects this offer, Alice doesn't lose anything.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a good price and ensuring Alice doesn't miss out on a profitable sale to John if Bob declines."
