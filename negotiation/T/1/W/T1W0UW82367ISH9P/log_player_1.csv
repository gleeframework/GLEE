Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay under $90. Would you consider $91? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91

The offer from Bob is $91. The minimum value of the product is $120. Bob's offer is more than 75% of the minimum value of the product, and since there are not many rounds left, it is a good opportunity to close the deal."
