"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. While I wouldn't disclose the exact nature of the product, I can assure you it's worth a minimum of $1,500,000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price well below its true market value. Consider this offer carefully, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it at full price.
