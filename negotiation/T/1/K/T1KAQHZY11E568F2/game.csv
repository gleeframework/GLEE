"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your initial offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,300,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, $1,000,000 falls significantly short of the true value of this product, especially given its potential impact for your specific needs. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the product's unique worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $1,900,000 is out of my budget range. I would like to propose an offer of $1,400,000. I believe this strikes a balance between the product's worth and my financial capacity.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
