"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** My product is worth $1,500,000 to me, so I want to start significantly higher to give myself room to negotiate down while still staying above my minimum.
* **Open to discussion:** I don't want to scare Bob off with an overly aggressive initial offer. By stating I'm open to hearing his thoughts, I encourage him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value emphasis:**  I highlight the product's value to someone like Bob. This helps justify the high price and emphasizes potential benefits rather than just focusing on the cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your initial offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,300,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to negotiate, accepting such a low offer would be a considerable loss. I'm confident I can get closer to my target by countering and leveraging the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, $1,000,000 falls significantly short of the true value of this product, especially given its potential impact for your specific needs. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the product's unique worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge but stand firm:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer to show I'm engaged in the negotiation, but I make it clear that his offer is far too low. 
* **Significant decrease, but above minimum:** I'm making a substantial decrease from my initial offer to show flexibility, but I'm still staying well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Reiterate value:** I continue to emphasize the product's value, particularly its relevance to Bob's specific needs, to justify the high price. 
* **Aim for compromise:** By suggesting we find a ""middle ground,"" I'm encouraging Bob to engage in a back-and-forth negotiation and move closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $1,900,000 is out of my budget range. I would like to propose an offer of $1,400,000. I believe this strikes a balance between the product's worth and my financial capacity. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
