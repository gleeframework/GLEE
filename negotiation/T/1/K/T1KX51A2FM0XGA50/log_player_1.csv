{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer balances a desire to maximize profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. By starting at $150, you are aiming for a higher profit than the guaranteed $100 from John.  However, it's still a reasonable price point that might entice Bob to buy."
