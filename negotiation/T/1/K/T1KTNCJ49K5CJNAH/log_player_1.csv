"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet.  It's too low. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $13,000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, Bob's offer is getting more reasonable. It's better to secure the deal than risk losing him completely and having to deal with John's potentially lower offer in later rounds."
