"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This would still leave you with a good profit, and it would be a great deal for me.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
