"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but you can potentially do better. By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This would still leave you with a good profit, and it would be a great deal for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and still allows Bob to make a profit of $1,500 on the product.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
