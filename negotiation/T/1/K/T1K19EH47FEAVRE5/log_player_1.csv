Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my ideal value as possible, but I also want to keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with my minimum acceptable price. This is still a significant profit for me and hopefully, it will be more appealing to Bob than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for $900,000.  I'm going to make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price is more appealing to Bob while still being acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm not confident we'll reach a price that meets my minimum.  It's becoming clear that we have a significant difference in what we both believe the product is worth.  To ensure I don't lose too much time and to secure a reliable profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
