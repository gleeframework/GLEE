"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's try to find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
