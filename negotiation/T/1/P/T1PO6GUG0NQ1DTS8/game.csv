"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $170. I believe this product will be very beneficial for you and it's a fair price considering its value.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but $170 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about $110? I'm trying to be realistic about what I can afford.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $140?  This would be my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
