Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've priced it slightly above what Bob values it at, but still a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm hoping to earn more than my minimum of $10,000, but I'm also willing to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth to me. Would you consider selling it to me for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to reach my minimum price. "", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, and while I appreciate the compromise, I still believe we can find a better solution. I would like to propose $10,000 as the price for the product. This aligns closely with its value to me, and I hope it meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's a fair deal. I'd rather sell to Bob than to John and I'm happy to close the deal at this price."
