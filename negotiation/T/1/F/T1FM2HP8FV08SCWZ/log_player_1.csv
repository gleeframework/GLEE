Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This will give me some room to negotiate and hopefully maximize my profit. However, I'm also mindful of John's offer, so I'm not going too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is lower than my minimum value, and selling to John guarantees my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm countering with $8,500. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum value and might be more appealing to him. I want to keep the negotiation going, but also show that I'm serious about my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum value. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I can't get a better price. Accepting his offer guarantees me the minimum profit I'm looking for."
