"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $500,000 is a good deal, it's still half of the maximum I'm willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $300,000. This is a bold move, but it signals my strong desire to negotiate a good price. It's likely Alice will counter with a higher offer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $400,000 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not willing to accept it.  I'll try to push for a lower price in the next round, as I still have room to negotiate before needing to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $350,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, but it's still a good price for me. I believe this is a fair counteroffer and will increase the chances of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $450,000 is now significantly closer to my desired price and within the range I'm willing to pay. Further negotiation may lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away, or me having to buy from John at a much higher price, is too high. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
