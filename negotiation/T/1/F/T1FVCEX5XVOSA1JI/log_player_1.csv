{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find some common ground!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum price of $10,000 and is closer to my desired price than John's offer. It's a good deal for me, so I'm going to accept it."
