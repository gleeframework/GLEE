Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not starting at my minimum acceptable price,  so I have room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm trying to be mindful of my expenses. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's room for a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. I can try to reach a price closer to $12,000.
* **John as a Backup:**  Remember, I can always sell to John for $15,000, giving me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating that this is still a great deal for Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by suggesting we ""get this done,""  keeping in mind that John is a viable alternative. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's price, $10,500 is still well above my minimum. I'm not giving up my leverage entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a risk that if I keep negotiating, Bob might drop his offer even lower. 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob. 

While I'm close to a deal with Bob, the certainty and higher price with John make him the better choice in this situation."
