"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $850,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $875,000.  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and still stay within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
