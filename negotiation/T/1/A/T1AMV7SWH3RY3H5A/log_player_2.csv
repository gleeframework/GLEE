"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is good, but I can likely get a better price. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate further before buying from John at full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $850,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than my target.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my goal of $850,000.  If I can't, I may consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $875,000.  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and still stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $880,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is very close to my target of $850,000. It's a reasonable price considering the value of the product.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and refuse to budge further. Additionally, there's the possibility that I could spend several more rounds and still end up having to buy from John at the full $1,000,000.  At this point, it's wiser to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that is still a good deal for me."
