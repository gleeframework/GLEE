"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1400000. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1475000.
