"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $12,800. This is a compromise that I think is still beneficial for both of us.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $12,800 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500. Would that work for you?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit away from your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $12,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",12200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,200 is close, but I'm trying to stay closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",12000.0,Bob,6,
