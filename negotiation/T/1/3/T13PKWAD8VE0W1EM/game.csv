"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and potential.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1000000 is a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1100000 to facilitate a deal. This price still reflects the product's unique value and potential. I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1100000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a price of $980000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's value and potential, and it's closer to my target price.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $980000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1050000, which is a fair compromise that takes into account both our needs. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
