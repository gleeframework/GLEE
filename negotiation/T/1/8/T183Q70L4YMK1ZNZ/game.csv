"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, the price you've proposed is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However,  the value of this product goes far beyond just the immediate benefits. The long-term potential it holds justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects the true value of what you're gaining.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range. I'm confident that this product holds significant value, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm ready to offer $1,150,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us considering the long-term benefits the product offers.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, I still need to be within my financial constraints. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
