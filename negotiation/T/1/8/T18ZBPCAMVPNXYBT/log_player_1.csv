"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant investment for you, and this price reflects the unique value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1000000, but I'm still not convinced it's worth that much. I'd be willing to pay $950000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is a fair price considering the unique value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. I believe I can get closer to $950,000 or even $975,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 7

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are in round 8, and Bob is still not willing to go higher than $920,000.  While this is closer to my minimum, I'm not confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price with more negotiation. Since I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, it's more secure to take that option than risk another round with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
