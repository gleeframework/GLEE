"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I can meet you halfway at $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9000 is closer, but still a bit out of my range.  How about $8250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about buying the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm really close to my target, but $8500 is still just a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  How about $8000? This is my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already told you, Bob, $8000 is my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower. I think this product is worth more than that, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you at $8250, but that's as low as I can go.",8250.0,Alice,7,
