"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to pay $95.  Let's make this deal happen!",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're serious about getting the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a deal for $102. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product provides.",102.0,Alice,5,
