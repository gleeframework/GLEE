The current offer from Bob is $850,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer to my desired price. Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I achieve my target profit."
