It's not smart to accept Alice's offer as it's above your budget.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."

This is your maximum budget and the price you can get from John. Let's see if Alice is willing to go that low."

Alice is still above my budget. I will counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying within a reasonable range. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
