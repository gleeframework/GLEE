"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor you to a high price by suggesting it's worth $12,000 to you. While her offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further or for you to negotiate a better deal."
