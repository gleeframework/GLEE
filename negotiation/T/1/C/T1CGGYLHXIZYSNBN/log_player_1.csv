Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, so I'm not willing to accept anything less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $750,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $850,000 is a good price for me, and I'm not sure I can get much more from Bob.  While I'm confident I could sell to John for $800,000, I'm willing to take the slightly higher offer from Bob."
