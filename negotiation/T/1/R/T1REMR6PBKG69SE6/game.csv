"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I think you'll find it's worth the extra $8,000 to get your hands on this amazing product.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $10,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate closer to that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning it.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
