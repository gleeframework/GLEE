{""product_price"": 7000}

You start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, hoping to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is a good starting point, as it's a substantial discount but still leaves room for negotiation."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still worth trying to push for a lower price. You've shown a willingness to negotiate, and there are still a few rounds left.  You can potentially get a better deal with a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

You're making a final push with a counteroffer that's only $100 below Alice's offer.  This shows you're serious about buying the product, but still trying to get the best possible price. It also forces Alice to decide whether to accept or risk losing the deal entirely."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice has demonstrated a strong bargaining position, and you're running out of time. You've made significant progress in negotiating down the price, but you're still above your target.  It's time to cut your losses and accept John's offer, which is within your budget."
