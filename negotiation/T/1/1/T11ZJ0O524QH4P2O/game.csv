"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for you.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,500, which would be $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
