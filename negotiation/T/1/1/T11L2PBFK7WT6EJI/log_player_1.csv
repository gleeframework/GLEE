Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

This is a high starting offer, but it allows for negotiation room. I believe the product is worth more than $2 million to me, so I'm aiming for a price that reflects that.  This will also help gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still leaving room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair compromise, and hopefully Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still way too low for me.  While I'd prefer to get more, John's offer is a safe and secure option.  I'm going to sell to John."
