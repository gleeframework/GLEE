"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I hope this aligns better with the value you place on the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated for the value I know this product holds. How about $900,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $900,000 is still out of my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This seems to be a reasonable compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,4,
