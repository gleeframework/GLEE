"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel valued.
* **Open Ended Question:**  I'm asking an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage and potentially reveal his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a price of $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Higher:** While $80 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial $100.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** Rejecting allows for a counteroffer from Bob, potentially pushing the price higher.
* **Testing the Waters:** This move gauges Bob's true interest and whether he's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $90?  This would still give me some room to make a profit and I think it's a fair price given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial offer, but not too far.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to justify the price point and build trust.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counter again, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are already in round 4, and I want to avoid running out of time.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm accepting a lower price this time,  building a relationship with Bob could lead to better deals in the future."
