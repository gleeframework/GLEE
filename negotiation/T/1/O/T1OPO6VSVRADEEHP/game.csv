"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,000,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a little high at $925,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $887,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $887,500. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a price of $900,000. This is still a great value considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm not willing to go below this point. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,5,
