"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,000,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  It's too high, and he can get a better deal from John.  There's no reason to accept it unless Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than what he could get from John.  He should counteroffer again to try to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a little high at $925,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $887,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $887,500. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a price of $900,000. This is still a great value considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm not willing to go below this point. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is unwilling to go lower than $900,000, which is still more than what John is offering.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice since Bob can get a better deal elsewhere."
