"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",775000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'll make a slight adjustment to $785,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",785000.0,Alice,5,,
