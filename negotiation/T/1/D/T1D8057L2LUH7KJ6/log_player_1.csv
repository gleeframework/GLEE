Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price well above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's ""immense value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John. If Bob knows your fallback, he has less incentive to negotiate above $1,000,000."
