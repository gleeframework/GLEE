"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is too low. While it's tempting to take that and avoid further negotiation, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum value of $15,000. I'll counteroffer and see where we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm countering with $11,500. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this shows my willingness to negotiate and motivates Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is a slight improvement, it's still quite far from my minimum value.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better offer. We're already halfway through the rounds, and I still have time to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering with $11,000.  This is a small decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm serious about closing the deal.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to move closer to my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still too low. We're approaching the halfway point of our rounds, and the negotiation isn't moving fast enough. I'm concerned that I'll end up with a price that's significantly lower than what I want. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000. This will guarantee that I get the minimum value for my product."
