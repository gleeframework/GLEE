"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of what's on offer.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you see value in the product, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its worth. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,850,000 is still a bit too steep.  How about we settle on $1,300,000? That feels like a fair price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is closer, but still undervalues the product. I can't go lower than $1,600,000. This offer stands as a firm commitment on my end.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your last offer is very tempting, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000? This would be my final offer.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
