"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a perfect fit for your needs. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's extremely fair to both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $12,000. There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or get the product for your ideal price from John."
