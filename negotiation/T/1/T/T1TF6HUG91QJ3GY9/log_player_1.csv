"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's worth a lot to me. I'm confident it will be valuable to you as well. My initial offer is $20,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $15,000. I have 8 rounds left and can still negotiate with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is lower than my initial price, I'm willing to come down to $17,000 to see if we can reach an agreement. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below it.  I have 6 rounds left and can potentially get a better price from Bob or sell to John for $15,000.  I want to try to push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 just doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to go down to $15,500. This is my final offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to go down to $15500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation process.  Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  With only 4 rounds left, the chances of him meeting my minimum are slim.  Therefore, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum value."
