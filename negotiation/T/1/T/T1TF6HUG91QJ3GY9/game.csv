"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12000 is lower than my initial price, I'm willing to come down to $17000 to see if we can reach an agreement. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but $14000 just doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to go down to $15500. This is my final offer before I explore other options.",15500.0,Alice,5,
