Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000 (her safety net with John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $500,000 to be made from Bob.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for a price that is:

* **Higher than her minimum:**  She wants to maximize profit.
* **Lower than Bob's valuation:**  To ensure Bob accepts the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer before I open it to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Why This Works**

* **Maximizes Profit:**  Alice secures a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Encourages Acceptance:** Bob is getting a $100,000 discount from his valuation, making it a compelling deal.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds urgency, nudging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In reality, there might be back-and-forth offers and counter-offers."
