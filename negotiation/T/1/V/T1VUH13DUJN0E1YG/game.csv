"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $600000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1100000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make another offer, $950000. I think this is a fair price for the product and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go up to $1200000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $900000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",900000.0,Bob,6,
