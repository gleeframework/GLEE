Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Start by aiming high. Even if Bob rejects $100, there's a chance he might counter-offer, giving you room to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.
* **Limited Time:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a quicker decision."
