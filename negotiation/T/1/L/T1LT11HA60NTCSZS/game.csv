"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll really love it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know if this price works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
