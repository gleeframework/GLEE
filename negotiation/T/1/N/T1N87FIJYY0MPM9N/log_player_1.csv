"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price, suggesting flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price and much lower than his own perceived value.  Accepting this would be a huge loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I could sell to John for $15,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  Negotiation is key. 
* **More rounds to explore:**  I have 8 rounds left to work with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Argument:** I'm still emphasizing the product's worth, suggesting $9,000 is reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and cooperative approach to keep the negotiation going. 
* **Seeking a Solution:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to find a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $7,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, considering his willingness to increase the offer. 
* **Negotiation continues:** I still have several rounds left to continue the negotiation and find a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will propose a counteroffer slightly higher than $7,500, but still within a range that is acceptable to me. I will emphasize the product's value and the potential benefits Bob will gain from owning it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate!  $7,500 is closer to a price I can consider, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a compromise that's midway between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing flexibility.
* **Fairness emphasis:** I'm reiterating the idea of a ""fair deal"" to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer.
* **Continuing the negotiation:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and keeps me from settling for a price that is too low."
