"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate!  $7,500 is closer to a price I can consider, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? That way we both get a fair deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
