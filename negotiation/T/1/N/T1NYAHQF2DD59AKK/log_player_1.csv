"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Building rapport:** I'm starting with a friendly message to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:** I'm not setting a hard price, which allows for flexibility in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open for multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  My minimum acceptable price is $10,000.  Bob's offer of $9,000 is lower than that.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is below my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, or potentially reach a deal with John.
* **Time to counter:** I'll use this round to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This strategy is cautious but allows me to maintain my goal of getting at least $10,000. I'm not desperate to sell, which strengthens my negotiating position."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. However, $9,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would ensure a smooth transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while still trying to secure a price closer to my minimum.
* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's midway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm framing the deal as beneficial to both of us, emphasizing a ""smooth transaction.""

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. I'm demonstrating flexibility while maintaining my goal of maximizing the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I can afford it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, it's still below my desired outcome.
* **Negotiation room:** There's still room to negotiate further. I'm confident I can get a slightly better price from Bob or potentially reach a deal with John.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and reinforces my position in the negotiation.

This strategy balances a desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal. I'm willing to push for a slightly better outcome, but I'm also prepared to accept John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to go down to $10,200. This is a very fair price, and it ensures you get the product you want while allowing me to cover my costs.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Explanation:**

* **One last concession:** I'm making one final concession, moving closer to Bob's offer while still securing a price above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to both of us, highlighting the benefit for both parties.
* **Closing the deal:** This offer is meant to be a strong closing offer, making it clear that I'm ready to settle.

This strategy aims to push Bob towards acceptance while still maintaining a strong negotiating position. I'm demonstrating flexibility while emphasizing the value of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is too low, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory price.
* **John's offer is secure:** I know John is willing to buy the product for $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is running out:** We're already at round 6, and each round increases the risk of not reaching a deal.

By selling to John, I guarantee myself a fair price and avoid further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my minimum requirement."
