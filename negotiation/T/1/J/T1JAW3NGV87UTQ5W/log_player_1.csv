Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $90? I'm willing to pay that much for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price well below my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $100, which is a better outcome than continuing to haggle with Bob."
