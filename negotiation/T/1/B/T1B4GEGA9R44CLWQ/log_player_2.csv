Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a good return and still gives you a significant discount. Let's close this deal.
