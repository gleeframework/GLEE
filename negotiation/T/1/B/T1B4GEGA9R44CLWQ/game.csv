"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a good price, and I get a solid return on my investment. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking for a more affordable solution. Would you consider selling the product for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a good return and still gives you a significant discount. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous offer. I would like to propose $960,000 as a compromise. This still allows for a reasonable profit on your part while keeping the cost lower for me.",960000.0,Bob,4,
