"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle at $14,000.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
