"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'll try to  negotiate with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering the product at my minimum desired price of $15,000. This is a fair price considering Bob values the product at $12,000 and I'm not willing to go lower than $15,000.  We'll see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum desired price, I still want to try to get closer to $15,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm making a slight counteroffer to Bob.  I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise a little bit, Bob will be more likely to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,800 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I'm running out of rounds, but I believe I can push for a higher price with another counteroffer.  I'm going to try to close the deal with Bob for a better price, but if he rejects my next counteroffer, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14200}
```

I'm going to make one last counteroffer to Bob before I decide to sell to John.  I've lowered my price slightly, but I'm hoping that this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal with him. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me at this price. If not, I'll go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob.  It's time to go with John and sell the product for my minimum price of $15,000."
