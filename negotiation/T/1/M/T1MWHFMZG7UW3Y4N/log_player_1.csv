Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and inviting Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation to get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While I value your interest, $130 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $135?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $132 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $132 is still below your initial desired price, it's very close. You've already been through a couple of rounds of negotiation, and $132 is a decent profit, especially compared to selling to John for $120.  It's better to secure a sale at this point rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that could potentially fall apart."
