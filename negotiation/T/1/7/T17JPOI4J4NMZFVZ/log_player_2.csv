"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than what others might pay for it. Considering its true worth, I propose a price of $14000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to start the negotiation low but not insult Alice.  $12,500 is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. 
* **Communicating Value:** Bob reiterates the product's value to him to show he's not just trying to get a bargain, but he has a specific budget he needs to stick to. 
* **Open to Discussion:** By asking ""What do you think?"" Bob keeps the negotiation open and invites Alice to counter if she needs to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the value you place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $13500 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, but it's still above Bob's desired price. There's still room to negotiate further.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  Rejecting the offer keeps Bob's options open. He might be able to get a better price in subsequent rounds or decide to buy from John if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $13,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. I'm willing to go to $13,000.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Offer:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer, but only by a small amount. This keeps the pressure on Alice without going too far.
* **Reiterating Budget:**  Bob emphasizes his budget constraints to reinforce his position.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive, suggesting a desire to find a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer. In light of your latest offer, I propose a price of $13250 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not There Yet:** Alice's offer is only $250 higher than Bob's last counteroffer, indicating she's willing to compromise. However, Bob is still looking to save as much as possible.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob still has a few rounds left to negotiate. There's a chance he might be able to get a better price by rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Rejecting doesn't immediately mean Bob will buy from John. It allows him to see if Alice is truly committed to making a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close!  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  $13,100 is my final offer. If we can agree on that, we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 13100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  Bob is signaling that he's nearing his limit.  The ""final offer"" language creates a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to consider the deal.
* **Small Concession:**  Bob increases his offer by only $100, showing he's being reasonable but not willing to budge much further.
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  The message acknowledges the progress and emphasizes the desire to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our negotiation history, I would like to propose a price of $13200 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Alice's offer is only $100 higher than Bob's last offer.  This is a small difference, and it's possible Alice won't budge further.
* **Limited Time:** With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice increases. It's getting closer to the point where buying from John might be the only option.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll get a significantly better price. Accepting this offer allows him to secure the product at a reasonable price, avoiding the risk of paying John's higher price."
