It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  It's possible Alice will reject this, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000.

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still a significant amount above my ideal price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can get closer to my target."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still pushing for a price closer to my target.  It's a compromise that may be more appealing than a flat rejection."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000

Alice has come down slightly, and while it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal compared to John's price. There's a chance I could continue negotiating, but the risk is that Alice will either reject further offers or walk away entirely.  It's better to secure the deal now at a price that's still within my budget."
