"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,500. I believe that's a fair compromise. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to discussing further if needed.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's a very fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not ready to sell at $11,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I believe this is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",12000.0,Alice,7,
