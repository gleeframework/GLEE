"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a product we both know is worth a significant sum.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This acknowledges the product's worth while still offering you a considerable discount.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I see that we're still not quite aligned on the price. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to propose $1,100,000. It's a step closer, but let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to its value, I'm still seeking a price that reflects its unique nature.  Would you consider $1,225,000?  This offer splits the difference between our previous offers and represents a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose $1,175,000. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still lower than your latest proposal. I hope this helps us reach an agreement that respects the product's value while fitting within my budget.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
