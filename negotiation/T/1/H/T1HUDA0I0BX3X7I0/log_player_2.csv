"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think?

This is the final round of negotiations with Alice. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob can get from John. With limited time left, Bob doesn't want to risk Alice rejecting his counteroffer, potentially leaving him with no deal at all. It's more advantageous to buy the product from John at a guaranteed lower price."
