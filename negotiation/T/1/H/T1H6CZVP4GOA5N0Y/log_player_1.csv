Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that amount as possible while still making a profit.

Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $950,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a 5% discount from the true value of the product to him, which should be attractive enough to get him to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob rejected my initial offer and made a counteroffer of $900,000. Since this is still a significant discount from the true value of the product to him, I'll consider making a counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My next offer will be:

{""product_price"": $925,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $925,000, which is a 7.5% discount from the true value of the product to him. This should be a more attractive offer to Bob than his initial offer, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
