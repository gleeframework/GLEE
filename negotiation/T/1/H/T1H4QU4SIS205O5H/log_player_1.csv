Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while staying above my minimum ($120). 
* **Create Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting slightly higher gives a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.

**Important:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer.  It's a balance between aiming high and ensuring the offer is enticing enough to avoid going straight to John."
