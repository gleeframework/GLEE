Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it, considering its value to me is capped at $1,200,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $1,820,000 is getting too close to John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  The potential gain from continuing negotiations with Bob is now outweighed by:

* **The risk of Bob walking away:**  He's clearly indicated a budget constraint. 
* **The time value of the sale:** A quicker sale to John provides immediate capital. 

It's more strategic to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk ending up with a lower offer or a failed negotiation with Bob."
