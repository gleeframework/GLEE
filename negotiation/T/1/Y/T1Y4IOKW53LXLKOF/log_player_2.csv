Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $820,000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $820,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $780,000. I think this is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 780000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to find a fair price, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $790,000 is now within Bob's budget and represents a significant discount from her initial price.  While John offers the product for $800,000, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $10,000.  Since Bob is focused on saving as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action in this round."
