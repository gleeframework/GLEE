Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $95 is a good starting point, allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob while still ensuring a profit for me. 
* **Plan B:** I'm always aware of John as a backup buyer, which gives me confidence in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I cannot accept it.
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:** I can reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. This allows me to potentially secure a better price.
* **John as a Backup:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I have no immediate pressure to accept a lower offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $90 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my original offer and Bob's offer.  This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Profitable:**  $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Going:**  I'm not immediately accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not walking away completely. This keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob a chance to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his latest offer of $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **No Further Negotiation:** I've already lowered my price twice.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John is a Sure Thing:** John is willing to pay my minimum price, which guarantees me a profit.  There's no point in risking a further drop in price with Bob when John is a secure option."
