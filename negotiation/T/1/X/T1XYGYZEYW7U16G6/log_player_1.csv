"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  This will give me a good starting point for negotiation and see if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is close to my minimum, I want to try and push for more. There are still 9 rounds, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $17,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to squeeze out a little more.  There's still plenty of rounds left."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $16,500 is tempting, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counter offer again and see if Bob is willing to budge.  I have a few rounds left to negotiate."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm narrowing the gap and offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I need to find a compromise that works for both of us."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have two rounds left and I want to see if I can get a little higher.  I'm not sure if Bob will counter, but I'm willing to take the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16750} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering a price that's closer to his last offer but still within a range I'm comfortable with.  With only one round left, this is my last chance to get a price I'm happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It's down to the wire, and while $16,000 is a little less than I'd hoped for, it's still above my minimum and a decent profit.  I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether and being stuck with the lower price from John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
