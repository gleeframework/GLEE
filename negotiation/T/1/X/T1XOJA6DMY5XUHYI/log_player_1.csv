"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 175} 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a reasonable offer, considering Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a decent profit and we're already halfway through the rounds."
