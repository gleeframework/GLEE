"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $135.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice's offer of $135 is less than John's price, you know you're willing to pay up to $150.  There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one."
