""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John.

Offering the product at $119 maximizes your potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob. He gets a $1 discount from his perceived value, and you earn almost $20 more than your minimum."
