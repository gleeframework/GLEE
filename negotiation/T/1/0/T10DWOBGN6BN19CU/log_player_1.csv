I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
