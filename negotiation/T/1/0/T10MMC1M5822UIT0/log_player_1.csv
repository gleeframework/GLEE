"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price within Bob's valuation. Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the price closer to his perceived value.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly highlights the ""value and potential,"" subtly reminding Bob of why he's interested without explicitly stating his maximum valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""starting price"" implies a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the process.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room to maneuver in future rounds if Bob rejects the initial offer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the potential of this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This offers you a good profit while still being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant profit, we're aiming higher. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to negotiate within a reasonable range. We still have ample rounds to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a substantial concession ($100,000) to show Bob we're serious about reaching a deal and incentivize him to negotiate further.
* **Holding Ground:** However, we're not meeting him in the middle just yet.  Staying firm at $1,200,000 keeps the price significantly above our minimum and leaves space for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Reiterating Value:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially nudge him closer to our target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I see your point about the product's value. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $1,200,000 is still a little too high.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This offers you a good profit while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has consistently moved towards a middle ground with each offer. Accepting his offer of $1,100,000 represents a fair compromise and a substantial profit for us. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, the potential gains are likely to be smaller and risk Bob walking away. 
* **Securing the Deal:**  Accepting now ensures we close the deal at a price significantly higher than our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob's future offers potentially decreasing."
