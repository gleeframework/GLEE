"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,300,000 is significantly closer to your maximum budget ($1,500,000) than to Alice's minimum value ($800,000). There's room for negotiation.
* **You have time and leverage:**  You have 10 rounds and a fallback option with John. This gives you leverage to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the potential of this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This offers you a good profit while still being within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, there's still a gap of $200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further.
* **You're still in a strong position:** You have 7 rounds left and a backup option with John, giving you leverage to push for a lower price.
* **Aim for a price closer to your desired range:**  Your initial counteroffer of $1,000,000 was a strong starting point. Aim for a counteroffer that is closer to that range, but slightly higher to show willingness to compromise."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I see your point about the product's value. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $1,200,000 is still a little too high.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This offers you a good profit while still staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
