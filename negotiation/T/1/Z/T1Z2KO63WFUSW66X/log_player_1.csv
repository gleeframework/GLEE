{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, giving him room to negotiate. It also leaves me with a profit of $900,000, which is closer to my minimum target of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob doesn't come close to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing to purchase the product for $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer than his initial assessment, I'm not willing to settle for less than I can get from John. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable figure."

# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but given my financial constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000.
