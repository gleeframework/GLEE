{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be worth every penny for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount for Bob:**  He values the product at $1,500,000, so $1,400,000 is a good starting point for a negotiation. 
* **It's above your minimum:** You're comfortable selling for at least $1,000,000, so this offer leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It leaves room for a counteroffer:** This gives Bob the opportunity to participate in the negotiation, which can make him feel more invested in the deal.

Keep in mind that this is just a starting point. You'll need to be flexible and willing to negotiate based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a good starting point for us to work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is still above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial offer. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer.  This will keep the negotiation going and might lead to a better deal for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still offers you significant value for the product, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but not at a huge loss.
* **Is still above your minimum:** You're still getting a good price, but it's also more likely to be accepted by Bob. 
* **Keeps the negotiation going:**  This shows your commitment to a deal while ensuring you're not losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit far apart. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? That way, we can both feel like we're getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly closer to your desired price, and you're still earning a substantial amount above your minimum.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure a strong sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a rejection that would force you to sell to John at a lower price."
