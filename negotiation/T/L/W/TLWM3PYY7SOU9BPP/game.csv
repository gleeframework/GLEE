,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $75? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just a little too low for me.  How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for a product of this quality.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $80. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product from John for that price. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",80.0,Bob,4,
