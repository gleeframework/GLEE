"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product's value, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to purchase the product, I cannot agree to $10,500. Could we possibly meet closer to my original offer of $9,500? I am willing to negotiate further.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference at $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. However, I still believe that $10,000 is a bit steep given my budget constraints. I am willing to pay $9,750 for the product, which is slightly higher than my previous offer. I hope this meets in the middle and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",9750.0,Bob,6,
