"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1000000, and we can go from there.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1050000, and see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $950000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $975000, and that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $975000 is still not enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at my minimum, but I need you to understand that I won't go any lower. Let's try $1100000, and if that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
