"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,200 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,800? It's still a great deal for a product worth $8,000, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!",7800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we go with $7,400? I think that's a fair price for a product worth $8,000",7400.0,Bob,4,
