# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. This item is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe it could significantly contribute to your endeavors or personal satisfaction. I am offering you the chance to own this product at a special price of $950,000. This is a generous offer, considering its true worth, and I hope it aligns well with your financial considerations. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further details or making an offer, as I am eager to facilitate this transaction and ensure that both parties benefit from this arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is still higher than its value to you ($1,000,000).
* **John's Offer:** John is selling the same product for $1,000,000, which is your maximum limit.
* **Decision:** It's more advantageous to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, as this option saves you $50,000."
