I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to sell the product, $100 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, or sell to John for $120."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price or sell to John for $120."
