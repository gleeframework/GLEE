Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing fairness to build a positive rapport with Bob and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room:**  By not starting at my absolute minimum, I have wiggle room to make concessions later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still push for a higher price through further negotiations.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.  This allows me to take a calculated risk with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also to maintain my desired price range.
* **Reasoning and Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer, focusing on fairness and mutual benefit to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving Room for Agreement:** I'm still leaving a small margin for potential concessions in case Bob is firm on his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer and am willing to move forward with a counteroffer of $1,125,000. This amount reflects the value I see in the product while also staying within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,150,000.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  Further negotiation might get me a slightly higher price, but it's not guaranteed. There's a risk of Bob walking away or me becoming too rigid.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing the negotiation will require more time and effort. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and move on. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees my minimum, I'm not maximizing my profit with that option. 

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and sensible choice. I can secure a decent profit and move on to other opportunities."
