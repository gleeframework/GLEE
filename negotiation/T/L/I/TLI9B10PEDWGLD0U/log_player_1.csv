"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's perfect for you. I'm asking for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value, but still within a reasonable range. This will give me room to negotiate if necessary, but also hopefully incentivize Bob to make a counteroffer.  I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $60 is far too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  This is a fair price for both of us and ensures we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $60 is too low, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $75 is closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to make another counteroffer in the hopes we can reach an agreement.  However, I'm getting closer to considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $80. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
