"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $16,250? This seems like a reasonable compromise for both of us.",16250.0,Bob,4,
