"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, your asking price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  Let me know if this price range works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and providing your perspective on the value.  While I understand your initial offer, the $600,000 price point is quite a ways off from what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the adjustment. However,  $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I can offer up to $700,000.  This is a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still significant.  I need to see a more serious offer from you to continue this negotiation. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. I believe this revised offer reflects a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a substantial amount for this product.  To be honest, $1,600,000 is still beyond my initial budget. I can stretch to $750,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering it's more than half your initial asking price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
