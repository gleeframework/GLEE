"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still too low, but I want to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit below that. How about $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,800 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about $8,900?  That's a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I'm still a bit above $8000. How about $8700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm concerned that I won't be able to get much higher than Bob's offer of $8,700.  I don't want to risk losing any more time and potentially getting a lower price, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
