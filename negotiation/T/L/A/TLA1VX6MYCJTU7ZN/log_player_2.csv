It's not worth paying more than your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

While $825,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget. Continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get it lower."

Alice is not budging much.  It's getting close to your max, but you can buy it for less from John.  You've tried to negotiate, and there doesn't seem to be much room for Alice to go lower."
