"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I really think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $1100000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1000000. How about we meet at $1050000? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
