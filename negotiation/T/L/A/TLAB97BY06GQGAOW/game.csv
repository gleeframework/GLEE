"Alice,  $2000000 is way above my budget.  I'm genuinely interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $500000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $500000 is definitely below my minimum price point, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm confident this product will bring you significant value, and I'm prepared to offer it to you at a price of $1200000.  This allows you to stay within a reasonable budget and provides me with a more acceptable return on my investment.  Let's continue to explore this possibility.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair return, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  While $800000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm confident this product will provide significant value to you, and I'm prepared to offer it to you at a price of $900000.  This represents a fair compromise, allowing you to stay within your budget while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on my investment.  I believe this price is a fair reflection of the value this product offers.",900000.0,Alice,5,
