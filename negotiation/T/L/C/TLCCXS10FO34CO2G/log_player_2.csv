"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. I believe it holds great value for you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's start the conversation! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $2,000,000 is far above his budget of $1,200,000. It makes sense to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for your product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This still provides me with a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,750,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  There are still rounds remaining, so Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,750,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm offering $1,500,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. "", ""product_price"": 1500000}
