Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000.

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $800,000.  I can still try to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my budget of $800,000.  While it is tempting to try and negotiate further, there is a risk of losing the product.  It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John at $800,000."
