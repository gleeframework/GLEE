"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product,  $900000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to accept $800000?  This is my absolute top limit, and I'm confident it would be a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
