"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This still leaves a good margin for you and gets us closer to a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. Would you consider $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too far off for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to accept $1,112,500. This is a fair compromise and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",1112500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate that.  While $1,112,500 is close, I'm trying to stay under $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,093,750?",1093750.0,Bob,6,
