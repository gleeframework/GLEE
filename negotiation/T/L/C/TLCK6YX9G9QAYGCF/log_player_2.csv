"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price, but he has the fallback option of John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $9,800. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the product from John for $8,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's the best I can do right now, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's getting closer to his budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  He can get the product from John for $8,000, so he should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your efforts, but $9,000 is still more than I can manage right now. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This feels like a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,800.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice is getting closer, but she's still above his budget.  He's already invested several rounds in the negotiation, and it's likely he won't get a better deal from Alice.  It's time to cut his losses and go with the sure thing."
