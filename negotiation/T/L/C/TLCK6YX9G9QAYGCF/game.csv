,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,000 is outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $9,800. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product.",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's the best I can do right now, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your efforts, but $9,000 is still more than I can manage right now. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This feels like a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,800. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product.",9200.0,Alice,7,
