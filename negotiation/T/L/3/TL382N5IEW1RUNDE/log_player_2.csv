"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to close the gap between his ideal price and Alice's offer.  By offering $10,000, he's showing he's serious about buying the product while also giving Alice room to negotiate.  This offer positions Bob for a potential win in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $11000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still potential for negotiation, and Bob wants to see if he can get closer to his target of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, giving Bob more chances to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, aiming for a price that's closer to his target. By offering $10,500, he's demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway while still leaving some room for further negotiation. This offer positions Bob for a potential win in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $10750? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is within Bob's acceptable range. It's a bit higher than his ideal price of $10,500, but it's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000. Accepting this offer means Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer or the negotiation dragging on. There's also a chance Alice could hold firm on this price and Bob would regret not accepting it."
