``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but it's still below the value I place on the product.  This gives me room to negotiate and see if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $800,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $825000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $795000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $795,000 is very close to my minimum value, I'm not willing to go below that. I've been through several rounds of negotiations, and it's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my minimum price.  John is a guaranteed sale, and I want to avoid any further risk of not closing the deal. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $800,000."
