"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,800,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,500,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is still quite a ways off from what I can accept. This product has a lot of value, so I propose $1,300,000 as a compromise. This feels like a fair offer considering its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  $1,300,000 is still a touch high for me.  How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
