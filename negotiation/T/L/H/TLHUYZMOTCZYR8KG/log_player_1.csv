"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for Bob. It also establishes a strong opening position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if we can reach a more profitable agreement for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $800,000 is a fair price for the product. Let's aim for that. If you can meet me halfway, we can reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $825,000 is still below my initial asking price, it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Given that we're already in round 4, and we're only 4 rounds away from having to sell to John, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
