You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to pay more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum price of $12,000.

You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still able to get the product for a lower price from John, so it makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice or just go with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to walking away, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is still higher than John's price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice because John is offering the product for a price that's within Bob's budget and more appealing."
