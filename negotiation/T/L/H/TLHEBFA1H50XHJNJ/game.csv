"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum price of $12,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,500.  If that doesn't work, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to walking away, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
