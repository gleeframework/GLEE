Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers."", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $150 allows for room to negotiate down if Bob isn't immediately willing to pay that much. 
* **Showing Flexibility:**  By saying ""open to reasonable offers,"" you signal that you're willing to work with Bob.
* **Product Description:**  Including a brief description will help Bob understand the value proposition.

**Important Notes:**

* **Know Your Market:**  The ideal starting price depends on factors like the product's rarity, market demand, and similar products available. 
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** You have a backup buyer in John, so you don't have to accept any offer that's below your minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is your minimum acceptable price.  While you might prefer to earn more, accepting his offer guarantees you a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which might lead to a worse outcome or a failed deal."
