"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,500,000 to you. Considering its value, I'm willing to make a generous offer of $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm hoping you'll take it seriously.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping we can settle on a price that's a bit more appealing for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire for a better deal, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
