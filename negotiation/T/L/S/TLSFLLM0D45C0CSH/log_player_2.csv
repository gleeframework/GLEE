"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $10,500?  That would make this a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still better off buying from John for $12,000. There's room for further negotiation with Alice to try and get closer to his ideal price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
