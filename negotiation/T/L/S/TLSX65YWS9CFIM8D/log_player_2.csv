# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is overvaluing the product:** She claims it's worth $1,200,000 to you, but you've established your maximum price is $1,200,000.  This suggests she's trying to inflate the price.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're a serious buyer but are looking for a better deal. This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **John provides a fallback:** You have the security of buying from John at $1,200,000 if Alice doesn't come down to a more acceptable price. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you encourage Alice to make a counter-offer closer to your desired price range. You hold a stronger position knowing you have an alternative option with John."
