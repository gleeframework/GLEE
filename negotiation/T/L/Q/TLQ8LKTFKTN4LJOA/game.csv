"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been developing for a while now, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its potential worth to you, but I'm open to discussing further if you have any questions or concerns. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,
