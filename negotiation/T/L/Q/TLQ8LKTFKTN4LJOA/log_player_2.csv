"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been developing for a while now, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its potential worth to you, but I'm open to discussing further if you have any questions or concerns. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but it's not the best deal possible.** You can still potentially get a better price.
* **You have leverage.**  You know John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, giving you a baseline for negotiation.
* **Rejection is a negotiating tactic.** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal your willingness to walk away and potentially encourage her to lower her price."
