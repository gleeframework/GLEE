This product is not just an item; it's a gateway to experiences and possibilities that align with your aspirations and needs. Given its intrinsic worth and the benefits it offers, I propose a transaction price of $1,350,000. This amount reflects a strategic balance between the value I see in the product and the value you attribute to it, aiming to create a mutually beneficial outcome. I believe this offer presents an excellent chance for you to secure a valuable asset at a favorable price.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below her perceived value, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a better price with her or proceeding with your backup plan to buy from John."
