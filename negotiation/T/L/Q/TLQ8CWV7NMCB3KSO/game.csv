"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I've already invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $120.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with another seller.",120.0,Bob,4,,
