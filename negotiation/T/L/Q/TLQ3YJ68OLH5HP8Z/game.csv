"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I need to make a starting point. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1200000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000 for it. This price is closer to my target and allows for some room to negotiate further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but I'm open to further discussion.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's my absolute limit. This shows my sincere interest in acquiring the product, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me at $900000. However, I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1050000 is simply beyond my budget. I'm willing to go to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. If we can bridge the gap at this price, we can both move forward with the transaction.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $950000. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to make a final counteroffer, and I hope we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1025000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1025000 is still a bit out of my range.  To close the deal quickly, I'm willing to go up to $975000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in securing this valuable product. If we can reach an agreement at this price, we can both move forward with the transaction.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $975000, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for the product. I've already made several concessions, and I'm starting to feel that I've reached my limit. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1000000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5% discount on the purchase price, which brings the total to $950000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
