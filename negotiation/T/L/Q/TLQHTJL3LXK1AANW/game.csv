"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $9,200. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $8,500. I'll offer it to you for $8,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8800.0,Alice,5,
