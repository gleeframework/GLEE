"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation. I'm confident I can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. I believe this is still a fair price considering my minimum and Bob's potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also starting to consider selling to John. It's important to weigh the risk of continuing negotiations against the potential of a guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11800}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  I hope Bob will accept this offer, but I'm getting nervous about the possibility of selling to John if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm starting to run out of time. Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if we can reach a compromise in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's the safer option at this point."
