Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, giving you a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $12,000 that it's worth to Bob, leaving room for him to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a fair price:** Considering the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, a price of $10,000 is still a significant savings for him.

This approach sets a strong initial negotiation position while keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product.  It's really in great shape, and I think it's well worth that price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise here.  By offering $9,500, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still protecting my desired profit margin. It's a fair middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a great product, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm happy to accept this deal and close the negotiation."
