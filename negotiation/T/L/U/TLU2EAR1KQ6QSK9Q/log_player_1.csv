{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $100 to me. I'm hoping Bob might bite, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $80 for it. Would you consider accepting this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you being upfront with your budget. While $80 is tempting, I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 
I'm offering $90, which is closer to Bob's budget but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $90. I would like to stick to my original offer of $80 if possible. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his $80 offer, and I'm not willing to go lower than $90.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $100, it makes more sense for me to sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation."
