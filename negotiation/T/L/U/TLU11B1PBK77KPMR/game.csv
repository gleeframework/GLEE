"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm open to $92,  which is closer to my value.  What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,
