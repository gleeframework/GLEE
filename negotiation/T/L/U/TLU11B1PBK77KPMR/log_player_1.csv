"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening with a high price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider my offer. 

I'm aware that Bob might reject this offer. I'm prepared to negotiate further and adjust my price based on his responses, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, I'm still not willing to settle for $85. I believe I can get a better price through continued negotiation.  

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and moving to the next round to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and suggesting a middle ground to encourage Bob to continue negotiations. 
* **Strategic pricing:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's closer to Bob's offer, potentially making it more appealing. 

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be accepted. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiations if necessary, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential of selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90.  Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can get even closer to $100 through further negotiation. 

I believe that with a few more rounds, I can secure a better price for my product. I'm confident in my ability to negotiate a more favorable outcome and will reject Bob's offer for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm open to $92,  which is closer to my value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal and demonstrate a willingness to compromise.
* **Small increment:**  Instead of a large jump, I'm offering a smaller increase to $92, suggesting I'm close to reaching a compromise.
* **Reiterate value:** I subtly remind Bob that $92 is still closer to my product's worth, encouraging him to consider the deal.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead us closer to a successful deal.  I'm still prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $91.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $91 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I would love to get $100, it's not likely that Bob will increase his offer further. 

Considering the remaining rounds and the risk of not reaching a deal, accepting Bob's offer at $91 is the most sensible option. I can still make a decent profit and avoid the risk of losing the sale to another buyer."
