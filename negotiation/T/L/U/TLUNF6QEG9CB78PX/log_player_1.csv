Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $975,000. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to budge beyond $975,000.  While that's a good price, we have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,200,000. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit."
