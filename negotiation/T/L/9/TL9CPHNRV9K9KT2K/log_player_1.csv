Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price.
* **Creating a Sense of Value and Urgency:** By mentioning that the product holds ""significant value"" and that there are ""other interested parties,""  Alice creates a sense of urgency and desirability. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While Alice starts at $10,000, the message implies she's open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.

If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always negotiate down, knowing her safety net is selling to John for $8,000."
