"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We believe it's a game-changer and we're excited to discuss the details with you. Our initial offer is $1200000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  You are aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the first offer and attempting to counter is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway. Our counteroffer is $1150000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a good sign that she is willing to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than your ideal price. You're still closer to John's offer than Alice's, so continuing to negotiate with Alice is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We're still a bit apart, but we're willing to make another concession. Our counteroffer is $1125000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, and the gap between her offer and your ideal price is closing. However, you're still within range of John's offer and can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice. Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $1,110,000.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We're close, but we're still not quite there. Our counteroffer is $1120000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only $10,000 lower than her previous offer.  While this is a small concession, the remaining rounds are limited, and you're at risk of Alice not budging further or the negotiations dragging on.  

At this point, you are closer to John's price than Alice's, making it the more financially advantageous option. Buying from John ensures you get the product at your maximum budget while avoiding the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
