{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is slightly lower than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation.  I'm aiming for a price close to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really like the product, but $135 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $125 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  That way we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise! However, $130 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has made it clear that he is not willing to budge on his price. While I could continue to negotiate, it is clear that we are at an impasse. To avoid wasting more time, I will sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
