Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you're in a strong position. You should aim for a price that's beneficial for you but still potentially tempting for Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your guaranteed sale price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language suggests you're open to discussion, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" subtly reminds Bob of potential benefits he might be undervaluing.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:**  How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to negotiate or walk away knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Consider adding a time limit to your offer to create a sense of urgency."
