"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal value. I'm also setting the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob, which will give me valuable insight into his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more. Bob's counteroffer confirms the product holds value for him, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage further negotiations.  $1,250,000 is still a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's interest.  This counteroffer allows for further bargaining while still staying within my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and represents a decent profit. With 6 rounds left, there's a risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a failed deal. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids potential risks."
