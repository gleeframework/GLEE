"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'd get great value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. This might prompt her to lower the price further, getting you closer to your goal of saving money. 

You can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000 if Alice doesn't budge."
