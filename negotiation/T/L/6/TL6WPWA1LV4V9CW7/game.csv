"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find very interesting. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product,  $1,100,000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in acquiring this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. What are your thoughts?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get a fair price. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price for your product, and I respect that.  However,  $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This offer is a significant step closer to your price, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept $925,000. I'm willing to make one more small concession. I'm counteroffering at $935,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. What are your thoughts?",935000.0,Alice,7,
