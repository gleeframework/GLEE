"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which holds immense value for you at $10,000. I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire a product that could potentially be worth even more in the future. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and interests. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is slightly below your maximum budget, you have a better alternative. You know John is willing to sell you the same product for $10,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply purchase from John."
