Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. It's a significant amount, but I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a bit above my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While his offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I will counter with a lower price and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,075,000, so I'll offer $1,062,500. This is my final offer, let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to reaching an agreement with Bob, time is running out, and I'm not convinced I can get a significantly better price from him. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk a lower price or a failed negotiation."
