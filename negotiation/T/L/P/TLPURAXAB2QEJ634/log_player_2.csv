"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is far too high, especially since he knows he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  Rejecting allows Bob to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his ideal price, it's still above his maximum. He has a better deal with John, and there's still room for negotiation with Alice.  Rejecting allows him to continue exploring a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This is a fair price, considering I can get the product from John for $8,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is lower than previous offers, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay, and he knows he can get it for cheaper from John.  There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and rejecting allows him to continue exploring a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still out of my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $9,500. This is a fair price, considering I can get the product for $8,000 elsewhere. Let's find a way to reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to **BuyFromJhon**.  While $10,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum. He knows he can get the product for $8,000 from John, and it's unclear if Alice will come down further.  To avoid potentially more rounds of negotiation and ensure he gets the product within his budget, Bob should buy from John."
