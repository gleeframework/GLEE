"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $8000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500.  This is a fair price, considering I can get the product from John for $8000. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still out of my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $9500. This is a fair price, considering I can get the product for $8000 elsewhere. Let's find a way to reach a deal that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
