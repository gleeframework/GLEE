Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price of $20,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will tell you a lot about his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Professional:** The message strikes a balance between confidence and courtesy."
