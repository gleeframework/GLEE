Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $130 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum ($100). 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend no more than $120.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a reasonable profit, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better price with Bob.  There's room to meet in the middle between his offer and my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $125?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting $125, I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price above his initial offer. 
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer could be my last before considering John's offer. It depends on how much Bob is willing to budge."
