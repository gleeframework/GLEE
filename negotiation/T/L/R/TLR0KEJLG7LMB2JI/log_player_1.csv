"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is genuinely interested and has the budget for a product of this value.  I want to maximize my profit, but also understand that leaving room for negotiation is important to avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round. There's still a chance we can reach a deal that's mutually beneficial, and I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum price of $1,200,000, but a lower price than my initial offer. I'm hoping this compromise will entice Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,200,000 I'm comfortable with. I'll continue to negotiate with him, hoping he'll come up a bit more in the next round. Selling to John is still an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm trying to meet Bob halfway and signal that I'm willing to close a deal. This is also a good opportunity to test if Bob is truly serious about purchasing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob and I are only $50,000 apart, but after several rounds, I'm not confident he'll go any higher.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  I'm going to sell the product to John to secure a stable and reasonable profit."
