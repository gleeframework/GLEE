"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1100000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850000, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product to you and my minimum requirements. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $975000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This is a significant offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my minimum requirements. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to reconsider the sale and explore other options.",925000.0,Alice,5,
