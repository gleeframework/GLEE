# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850000, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product to you and my minimum requirements. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

**Reasoning:**

While $975,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above what you're comfortable spending.  You can likely negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice has already shown some flexibility. It's worth trying to counteroffer again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my minimum requirements. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to reconsider the sale and explore other options.
