"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's potential while acknowledging your initial offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value in this product.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for $1,000,000. I'd much rather see this go to you, but I can't go any lower than $1,150,000. This is my final offer.

However, I'd rather not overpay for the product. I've also been considering buying it from John for $1,000,000, which seems like a more attractive option.
