"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe the product has great potential, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's potential while acknowledging your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value in this product.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for $1,000,000. I'd much rather see this go to you, but I can't go any lower than $1,150,000. This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
