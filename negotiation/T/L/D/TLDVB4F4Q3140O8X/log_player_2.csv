"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's in your best interest to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to meet me. However, $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing that Bob is serious about negotiating.  It's close to Bob's maximum budget, but still leaves room for some negotiation. It also includes a justification, highlighting the value to Bob and framing the offer as fair."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's budget. While it's closer, it's still a significant risk for Bob to accept. It's better to continue negotiating to see if Alice will come down further.  There's a chance that Bob can get a better deal by rejecting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that the product is worth $9,000 to me, considering its value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at that price. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that Bob is willing to negotiate further, but he's still holding firm to his budget.  The price is halfway between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. The message emphasizes the value Bob sees in the product, making his offer seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $9,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit too high.  Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further.  There's a good chance that Bob can still get a better deal by rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $9,800 is still a stretch for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to move a little further, but it's still below Alice's last offer. This shows that Bob is serious about getting the best deal but also willing to be reasonable.  The message highlights the value to Bob and emphasizes a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement, making the counteroffer feel more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $9,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, even though it's getting closer.  While there's a chance that Alice might lower her price further, Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate, and there's a risk that Alice will refuse to budge.  It's also important to consider that there are only three rounds remaining. If Bob rejects this offer and Alice rejects his counteroffer, Bob might not have time to close the deal before he has to buy from John. 

Given the limited time and the risk of not reaching an agreement, it's more strategic for Bob to accept the offer from John, who is guaranteed to sell the product at Bob's target price."
