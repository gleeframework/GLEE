"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  This product is truly exceptional and I believe you'll see the value it brings to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is closer, but still a bit out of reach. Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, but that's really pushing my limits. This product is truly one-of-a-kind, and I think you'll see the return on your investment. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground.  Let's aim for a final price of $1,075,000.  This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.  I'm confident you'll be very happy with the value this product provides.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
