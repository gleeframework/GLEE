{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly unique and I believe it will be a valuable asset for your business.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price and far too low for the value of this product.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  This product is truly exceptional and I believe you'll see the value it brings to your business."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is closer, but still a bit out of reach. Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, but that's really pushing my limits. This product is truly one-of-a-kind, and I think you'll see the return on your investment. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,050,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my goal. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can convince Bob to go higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground.  Let's aim for a final price of $1,075,000.
