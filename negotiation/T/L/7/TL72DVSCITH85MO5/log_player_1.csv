Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal outcome ($1,500,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the value to Bob to emphasize why this price is justified. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using a friendly tone and leaving the door open for discussion. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a high price and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. 

Selling to John at this moment would result in a lower profit. 

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,300,000?  This price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he gets at this price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage further discussion and a successful negotiation.

This strategy attempts to find a middle ground that is attractive to both parties and moves the negotiation closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1200000. Would you be willing to consider $1250000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer and is now at $1,250,000. While this is still below my ideal price, it is only $50,000 away from my last counteroffer. Considering:

* **The risk of further negotiation:** Bob might not budge further, potentially leading to a lower offer or a deadlock.
* **The time cost:** Continuing negotiations could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a stalemate.
* **The guaranteed profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit of $250,000, which is better than selling to John for $1,000,000.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical decision at this point.  It ensures a reasonable profit and avoids the uncertainties of further negotiation."
