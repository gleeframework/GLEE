Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than our safety net of $1,000,000 from John.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message aims to convey the product's value without seeming too aggressive. We acknowledge Bob's perception of value while confidently setting a strong initial price. 

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome while still guaranteeing a substantial profit if Bob declines."
