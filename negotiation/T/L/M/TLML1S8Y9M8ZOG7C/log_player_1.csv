"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and has a high budget. If he rejects, it gives me a sense of his perceived value and I can adjust my strategy for the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $950,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum and shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will get us closer to a final agreement."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob has clearly shown he's not willing to go above $800,000, which is my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, securing the guaranteed $800,000 is the best option at this point."
