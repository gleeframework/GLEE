"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly based on its potential return on investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
