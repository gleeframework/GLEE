Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below both the product's value to me and his own valuation.  I will counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm aiming for a budget closer to $700,000.  Would you consider $725,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

While closer to my baseline, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. Selling to John is my fallback option if the negotiations don't improve."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
