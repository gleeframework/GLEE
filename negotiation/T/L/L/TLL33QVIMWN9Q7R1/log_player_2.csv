Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go a bit higher than $100, but not much. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $100 than risk Alice not budging further."
