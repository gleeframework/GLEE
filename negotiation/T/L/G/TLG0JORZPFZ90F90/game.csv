"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than you're paying and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $110? This still leaves you with a good margin and gives me a fair price. Let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $107.50? That seems fair for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $108.75?  It's a good compromise, and I think we can finalize this deal.",108.75,Alice,5,
