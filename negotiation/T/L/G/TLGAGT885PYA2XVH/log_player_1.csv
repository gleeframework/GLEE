{""message"": ""Bob, I have a truly exceptional product I believe you'd be very interested in. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, and I'm confident it could be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you first at $1,500,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

``` 
 
The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and Bob's offer is below that.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than its minimum value to me.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a better agreement."

Let's find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm running out of time and Bob is stuck at his price. I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether, so I'll sell to John. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's better than getting nothing."
