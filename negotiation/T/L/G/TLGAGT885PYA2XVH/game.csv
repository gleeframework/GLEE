"Bob, I have a truly exceptional product I believe you'd be very interested in. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, and I'm confident it could be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you first at $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm confident it holds immense potential for you, and I'd like to propose a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1350000.  Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While I'm eager to make a deal with you,  $1250000 is still below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of this product for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1220000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close to a deal. I'm very motivated to work with you, but $1220000 just isn't enough. I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about we settle at $1275000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value of this product soon after you acquire it.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
