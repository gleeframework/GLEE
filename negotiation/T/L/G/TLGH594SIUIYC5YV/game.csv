"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be open to that?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $9,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
