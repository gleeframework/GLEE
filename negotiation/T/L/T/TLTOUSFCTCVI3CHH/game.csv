"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your initial offer falls quite short of reflecting the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that this product holds significant value, but I'm only able to offer $1,400,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
