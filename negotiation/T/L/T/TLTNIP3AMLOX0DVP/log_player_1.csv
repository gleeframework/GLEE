Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the minimum price I'm willing to accept. There's no room for further negotiation and it's unlikely he'll go higher. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired price without further hassle."
