"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe holds tremendous value. My initial asking price is $1500000. This reflects its unique features and potential.  I'm open to discussion, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down in price, especially since Bob has a clear alternative (buying from John)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  However, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value and my alternative options.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1000000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1250000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's work together to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Bob should continue to negotiate, especially since he can always buy from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, considering its value and my other options. I'm confident we can find a way to agree on this figure."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
