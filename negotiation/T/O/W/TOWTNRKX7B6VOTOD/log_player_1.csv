Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value is $150. I want to leave room for negotiation while also ensuring a decent profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm counteroffering with $175. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still securing a profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $160 is a good deal considering I have limited rounds and the possibility of selling to John for only $150."
