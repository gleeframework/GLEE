"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this proposal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm still confident this product holds even greater value for your specific needs.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite comfortable with $1,275,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'd appreciate it if you could consider this revised offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
