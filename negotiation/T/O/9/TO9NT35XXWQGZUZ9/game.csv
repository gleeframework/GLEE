"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the value I place on it.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1400000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1550000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to secure a fair price for my product.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers, so how about $1475000?",1475000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $1475000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $1500000. How about $1525000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1512500?",1512500.0,Bob,6,
