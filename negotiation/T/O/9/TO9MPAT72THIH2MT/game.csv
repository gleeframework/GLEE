"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking for a price closer to my budget. I propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,400,000 is a bit too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial asking price.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. This is still within my budget, but I hope we can find a middle ground.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
