"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,200,000 is far too high for Bob's budget.  He needs to reject the offer and counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,000,000 is significantly below its true market value. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's preferred budget.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're making progress. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm willing to consider $1,550,000.  This offer takes into account the value you've placed on the product while acknowledging the significant benefits it provides.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  He should continue to negotiate for a lower price. There's still room for a compromise that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While $1,550,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This offer reflects the value the product holds for me, and it allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. Let's make this happen â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,425,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While there's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price in the remaining rounds, the risk is high that Alice won't budge further. 

It's safer and more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
