{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial.  I'm asking $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more substantial saving. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. However, selling to John for $1,500,000 is an attractive option.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range. This gives me the chance to potentially get a better deal with Bob or move on to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save, but my minimum price is $1,500,000. This product truly is a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,625,000.  This price is fair to both of us and allows for a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 1625000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further, and I risk losing him as a buyer. Additionally, selling to John for the same price offers no benefit. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
