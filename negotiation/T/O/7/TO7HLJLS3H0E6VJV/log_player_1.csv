Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I'm looking to invest a bit lower. How about we bring the price down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $875,000 is a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000?  That would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price well below my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which is a safe bet at this point. It's better to take the guaranteed profit than risk Bob not significantly increasing his offer in the remaining rounds."
