{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $16,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I could accept and avoid further negotiation, it's worth exploring if I can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a great price considering the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet halfway at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is slightly below my initial target, it's still a good deal considering Bob's initial offer.  It's more than my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether.  I'll accept his offer."
