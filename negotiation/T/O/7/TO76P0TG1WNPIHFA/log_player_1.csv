Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Considering its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true value. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 allows some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below $1,000,000.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging his potential desire for a deal."
