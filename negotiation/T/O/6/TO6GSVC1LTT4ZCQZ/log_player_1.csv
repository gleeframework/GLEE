"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still ensuring I get a good profit. I'm aiming for a balance between maximizing my potential earnings and not scaring Bob away with an unrealistic price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd like to get even more, I'm aware that negotiations can take time and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept this offer and secure a good profit."
