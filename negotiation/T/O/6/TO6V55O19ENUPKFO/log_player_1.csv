Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $17,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $17,000 gives me a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately seems unreasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for some negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 acts as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall or go too low, I can always switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'd prefer to try and get more from Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  That's still a great deal for a product you value at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to compromise, but not significantly. $16,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob sees in the product by mentioning his own perceived worth ($15,000).
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about getting a good price, but not desperate enough to accept a lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we settle in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $14,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Further negotiation could lead to more back-and-forth and a risk of ending up with a lower price.
* **Time is money:**  It's better to accept a slightly lower price than to risk further delay and potentially losing the sale altogether. 
* **John is still an option:**  If something goes wrong with the transaction with Bob, I can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000."
