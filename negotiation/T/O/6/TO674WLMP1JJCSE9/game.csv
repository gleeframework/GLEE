"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
