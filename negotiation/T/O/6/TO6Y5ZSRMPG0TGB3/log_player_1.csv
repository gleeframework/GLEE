Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  A price too close to $1,500,000 might make him balk, while a price too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It positions the product as valuable and exclusive, justifying the high price.
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. 
    * It's significantly above your minimum ($1,000,000).
    * It leaves Bob with a potential profit ($150,000), making it likely he'll accept.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob counters, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum!"
