"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get it for a price significantly below its value to you, and I get a good profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have a fallback option with John at $1,500,000.  There's a chance you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since she still profits even at a lower price."
