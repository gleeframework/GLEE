Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the potential value in this product, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider $1,400,000 as a starting point.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,650,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,525,000.  This shows my commitment to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Exceeds my minimum:** This offer is above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000, securing a profit.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing a strong desire for the product. Accepting now capitalizes on this momentum and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling negotiations. 
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation has a cost. Accepting now allows me to re-invest the capital sooner and explore other opportunities.

While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, the additional $25,000 from Bob makes accepting his offer the more attractive option."
