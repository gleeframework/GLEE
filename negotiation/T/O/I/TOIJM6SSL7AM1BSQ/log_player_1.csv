I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's a bold move, but I believe it will maximize my potential earnings. I'm confident in the value of my product and am willing to negotiate, but I want to establish a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,400,000 is a respectable offer, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above his initial counter. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable middle ground and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is very close to my desired price and significantly higher than John's offer.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
