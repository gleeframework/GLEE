Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I need you to throw in some extras to make it worth my while. I'm thinking a 2-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package. If you're willing to do that, I can meet you at $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering additional value (warranty and maintenance package) along with the product for $1,300,000. While the extras could be appealing, my goal is to save as much money as possible, and I'm  reaching the point where it might be more beneficial to buy from John. Since John's offer is lower than Alice's even with the extras, and we only have 3 rounds left,  I'll buy from John to guarantee the best price."
