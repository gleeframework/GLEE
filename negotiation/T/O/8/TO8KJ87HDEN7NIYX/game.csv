"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant concession. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which represents a significant compromise from my initial position.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a common ground. However, $900,000 is still not a viable option for me. I'm willing to go down to $925,000, but this is truly my final offer. Let's close this deal before we run out of time.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I value your persistence in finding a solution. While I appreciate your offer, $912,500 is still below my acceptable range. Let's aim for a final agreement. I'm offering $920,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can finalize this deal. Let's see if we can shake hands.",920000.0,Alice,7,
