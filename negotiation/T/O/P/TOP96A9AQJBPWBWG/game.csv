"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that's beneficial for both of us. My starting offer is $1400000.  Let's talk!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1300000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product to both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try to meet each other halfway from $1300000? That would be $1200000 for me and $1400000 for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
