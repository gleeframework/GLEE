Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  While the stated price is above Bob's perceived value, the message hints at the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to be prepared to adjust your price downwards during the negotiation. If Bob outright rejects the $20,000, you can gradually lower the price, but never go below your safety net of $15,000 (since you have John as a guaranteed buyer)."
