"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is way too high.  You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to even consider this offer."
