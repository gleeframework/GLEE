"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially setting the price at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price given my current budget and the value you've outlined.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I'm confident in the true worth of this product and its potential for you.  I could come down to $1,120,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it holds. What do you say?",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position and value the product's potential. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This shows my seriousness in acquiring this product, and it's a significant move from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,100,000? This reflects the product's value while recognizing your investment.  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
