Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below what John is willing to pay.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for that price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above what I consider the minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to buy the product."

```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Bob might walk away, and I would then be forced to sell to John at a lower price than what I'm currently being offered."
