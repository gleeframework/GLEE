{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses openness to discussion, which can make Bob more likely to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$105 is a good price for you, as it's above your minimum of $80 and still leaves room for profit. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids risking a further drop in price during negotiation."
