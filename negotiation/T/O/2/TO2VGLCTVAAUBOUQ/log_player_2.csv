Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1250000 is still a little below what I believe the product is worth.
