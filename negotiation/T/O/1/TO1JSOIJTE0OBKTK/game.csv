"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8200. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $8200. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7800. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",7800.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to meet you at $7500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If I don't get a better offer, I'll have to consider buying from someone else. Can you really sell it to me for $7500?",7500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your frustration, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $7500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $7900. This is my final offer. What do you think?",7900.0,Alice,9,
