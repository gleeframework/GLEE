"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, that price undervalues the product's potential. Could you consider $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced the product is worth $1,650,000. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I have to be upfront.  Another buyer is prepared to offer $1,200,000. To make this worthwhile for me, I need you to be closer to $1,500,000. How about $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to pay $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000, so I'll offer $1,350,000 for the product.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  Let's make this simple: $1,450,000, and we have a deal.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to pay $1,450,000. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is closer to what I think it's worth.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, this is it. I'm willing to walk away and take the other offer if we can't agree now. $1,375,000 is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.",1375000.0,Alice,9,
