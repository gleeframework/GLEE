Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum price, leaving room for negotiation, but it's still lower than Bob's perceived value.  This should encourage him to accept, but also leave room for a counteroffer if he's feeling aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $9,000. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still worth pushing for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my ideal price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? I believe this is still a fair price considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,250 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $8,000 and within a reasonable range of what I was hoping to get. Accepting this offer is the best strategy to maximize my profit without risking losing the sale to John or prolonging the negotiation further."
