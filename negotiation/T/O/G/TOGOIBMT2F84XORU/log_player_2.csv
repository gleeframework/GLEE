"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's a chance Alice might accept a lower price, especially since her minimum value is $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $130? I'm really interested in the product, and this price would be a good value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
