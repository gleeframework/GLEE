"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $80. I am willing to let you experience its benefits first-hand. Would you like to purchase it for $95?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, as you mentioned it's worth more than that. Can you meet me in the middle at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I would like to offer you the product for $90, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value it provides.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $85, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. Considering the value and quality of the product, I would like to offer it to you for $88. This price reflects the exceptional features and benefits it provides. I hope this meets your expectations.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $88 is the best value for me. I'm willing to go up to $82.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further. For $85, I believe we can reach an agreement that reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us. I hope this offer works for you.",85.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $85. I'm willing to go up to $82, but that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price?",82.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer it to you for $83. This price reflects the quality and benefits of the product, while also being within your budget. I hope this offer suits your needs.",83.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit tired of going back and forth, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $80, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",80.0,Bob,10,
