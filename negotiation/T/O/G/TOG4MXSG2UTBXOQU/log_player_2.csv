"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and Alice is offering the product at that price, there is no benefit to accepting her offer. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy the product from John at the same price."
