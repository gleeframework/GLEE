"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for a much lower price than $750,000. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately.  By rejecting, you can start a negotiation and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price.  This is a strong opening move that shows I'm serious about negotiating. It also leaves room for potential compromise.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer immediately, but it will give us a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only lowered her price by $50,000, which isn't a significant enough reduction. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can get a better price.  I'll counter with a higher offer than my previous one, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $600,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.  I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still trying to get a good price.  I believe Alice is more likely to accept this offer than my previous one, but still allows for further negotiation if she needs to reduce her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly to $650,000. This is a good deal considering my maximum budget is $1,200,000. While there's always a chance we could negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go much lower, and it's not worth risking losing the deal to John.  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I've saved a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."
