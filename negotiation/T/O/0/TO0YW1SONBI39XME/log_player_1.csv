Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This is to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects this, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but hopefully, I can secure a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my acceptable value, I'm running the risk of a protracted negotiation with Bob.  Since John is offering me $1,200,000, which is already above my minimum, it makes sense to secure that deal and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
