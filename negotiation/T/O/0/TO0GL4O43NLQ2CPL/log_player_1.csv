"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious but not outrageous offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justifying the Price:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" helps justify the high price, even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, you signal that you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to a potentially acceptable range, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and my initial asking price.  There's plenty of room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is generous, the true value of this product is rooted in its long-term potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,550,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to reach an agreement while ensuring a fair reflection of the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my price by $50,000, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. However, the concession is calculated to keep the deal above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm continuing to emphasize the ""long-term potential"" of the product to justify the high price in Bob's mind. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** My language emphasizes finding a compromise that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at $1,350,000, which is still below my absolute minimum ($1,200,000). However, his latest offer was a significant jump. I need to signal I'm getting close to my limit.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open but with added pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,475,000. However, I must be transparent, this is my final offer. I believe it represents a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while meeting you closer to your budget. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1475000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and signal that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced the price by another $75,000, demonstrating continued willingness to negotiate, but making it clear that substantial movement is no longer possible.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob that I have a backup plan (John), increasing the pressure to accept this offer. 
* **Above Minimum:** Importantly, this final offer is still above my absolute minimum, allowing me to walk away if Bob doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency about the final offer, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's final offer of $1,400,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,200,000, securing a profit.
* **Stalemate:** We've both presented final offers, suggesting further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting ensures a good deal now. 

While I could push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing Bob entirely. Accepting this offer represents a strong outcome in the negotiation."
