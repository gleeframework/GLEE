"I understand that $15,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,500, but I'm still a little too high.  I'm firm on $15,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on $16,000, but I'm still hoping we can find a solution closer to $15,500.  Would you consider $15,750?  It's a small step closer to your number and would allow us to close the deal.",15750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to budge much further, but I'm willing to meet you at $16,200. This is a compromise, and I think it's the best we can do. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16200.0,Alice,7,
