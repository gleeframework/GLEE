Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm offering it for $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000} 
 
**Reasoning:**  It's best to start high to allow room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum and Bob's perceived value.  This allows me to potentially secure a very favorable deal while still having room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Is there any room for negotiation? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's significantly below both my minimum and my initial asking price.  Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about getting a better price and keeps the negotiation alive. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To make this work, I can go down to $15,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference, with a Twist:** I'm coming down significantly from my initial offer, but not meeting Bob in the middle. This shows flexibility but also emphasizes that I'm making a concession.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision.  
* **Leaving Room to Walk Away:**  While $15,000 is a good profit, I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is a reasonable compromise. It exceeds both my minimum price and John's offer, securing a solid profit. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a good outcome."
