"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can come to a more agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I accept $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",10250.0,Bob,4,
