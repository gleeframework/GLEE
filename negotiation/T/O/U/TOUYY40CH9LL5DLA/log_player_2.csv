# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is around $800,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This price is significantly lower than what I could get from another buyer, but I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts.
