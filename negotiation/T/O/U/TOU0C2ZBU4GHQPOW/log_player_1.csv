Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is well above your $800,000 floor, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 leaves Bob a significant profit margin of $300,000, making the offer attractive to him. 
* **It sets a strong initial position:**  By starting high, you establish a baseline for the negotiation. 

Keep in mind:

* **Flexibility is key:** Be prepared to adjust your price depending on Bob's response.
* **Don't be afraid to walk away:** If Bob is too low or becomes unreasonable, remember you have another buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** While $900,000 is better than John's offer, there's still potential to get closer to your desired price.
* **Negotiation strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you demonstrate your willingness to walk away and encourage further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:** A counteroffer allows you to maintain control and potentially push the price up further.

**Next Steps:**

You will need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider a price between $900,000 and your initial offer of $1,200,000. This will keep the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  However, $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm prepared to accept $1,000,000. This represents a significant value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, falling between your previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Maintaining a profitable price:**  $1,000,000 still represents a significant profit margin for you, keeping you above your minimum.
* **Clear and concise:**  The message reinforces your desire to find a mutually beneficial deal.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to wait for Bob's response.  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, you'll need to decide if you want to counteroffer again or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this revised price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your desired price:** While not your initial target, $950,000 is only $50,000 away from your counteroffer of $1,000,000.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether and forcing you to settle for John's offer of $800,000.
* **Time value:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows you to finalize the deal and move on from this negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer of $950,000 represents a good balance between maximizing your profit and securing a sale."
