Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $17,000 is a bit below what I had in mind.  Could you meet me at $18,500?"", ""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

This price is closer to my target, and further negotiation might not yield significantly better results.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
