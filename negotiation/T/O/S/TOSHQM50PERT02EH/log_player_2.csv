Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but her concessions are getting smaller.  At $815,000, we're getting close to a point where further haggling might not yield much, and we risk her becoming less willing to negotiate. This price is a significant savings compared to John's offer, and well within our budget."
