"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $775,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer a slight concession and propose a price of $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I hope you'll consider it.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession and propose a price of $815,000.
