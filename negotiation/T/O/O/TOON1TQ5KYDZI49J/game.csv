"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, I am unable to agree to a price of $850,000. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $795,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.",795000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $795,000 is a good price, I'm not quite ready to accept that.  Would you consider a price of $825,000? This is closer to my initial assessment of the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal, and while I understand the value of the product, I must adhere to my budgetary constraints.
