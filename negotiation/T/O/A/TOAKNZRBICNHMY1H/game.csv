"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I'm interested, I'm hoping for a price closer to $1200000.  This would allow me to secure the product while staying within my budget. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1400000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $1300000. This would make the deal work for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by reducing the price to $1400000 and then to $1350000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1350000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  $1350000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm going to need to see a price closer to $1325000 to make this deal work for me. This feels like a reasonable compromise that allows us both to get what we need.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1325000 and $1350000, which is $1337500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1337500.0,Alice,7,
