"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant.  I could consider coming down to $2,000,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a workable solution here.  $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
