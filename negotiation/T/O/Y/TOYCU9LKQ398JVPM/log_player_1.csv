"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $6,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,250 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can get a bit higher. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $7,250 is still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $7,875. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7875}
