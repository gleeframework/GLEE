,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,700,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,550,000? This takes into account the market value and the unique benefits of this product.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 still falls short of what this product is worth. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering the value and the potential you'll gain from this product.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $1,250,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions and allows us to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
