Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By starting at $130, I can potentially reach a price that's more favorable to me if Bob counters. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $130 is above my minimum of $150, so I'm still earning a profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's acceptable.
* **Be prepared to counter:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll need to counter with a higher price.
* **Consider John's offer:** If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always switch to John who is guaranteed to buy at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and significantly lower than my initial offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation and the potential to reach a price closer to my initial offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter with a price higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer. This strategy aims to find a compromise.
* **Assess Bob's response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Be prepared to walk away:** If Bob continues to refuse to meet my price, I will sell to John to guarantee my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This would still allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Maintain negotiation leverage:** I'm not immediately accepting Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but also have a firm price in mind.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll need to reassess his counteroffer.
* **Be prepared to counter again:** If Bob's counteroffer is still too low, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or switch to John.
* **Remember John's offer:**  John's offer of $150 is a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's not enough to make it worthwhile.
* **John's offer is more attractive:**  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a better deal than accepting Bob's offer and potentially having to continue negotiating.
* **Risk of further concessions:** If I accept Bob's offer, it could set a precedent for further price cuts and I might end up with a much lower final price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum. I'll aim for a price close to $120 to see if I can reach a compromise.
* **Prepare to switch to John:** If Bob continues to reject my counteroffers, I'm ready to sell to John to secure my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to go down to $115. This is a fair compromise that still lets me make a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's almost at my minimum but still slightly above Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining my profit margin.
* **Potential for Acceptance:** The offer is closer to Bob's preferred price, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Minimizing Risk:** If Bob rejects, I can easily switch to John for my minimum profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll sell to John.
* **Prepared for John:** I'm prepared to switch to John's offer immediately if Bob rejects my final counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **No Room for Further Negotiation:**  There's little room for further negotiation, and the potential for additional counteroffers is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** John's offer guarantees a profit of $150, which is a better deal than the potential risk of continuing negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:** I'm switching to John's offer to secure my minimum profit and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
