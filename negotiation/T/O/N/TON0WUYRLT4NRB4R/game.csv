"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we start at $800,000 and see if we can find some middle ground?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $800,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about $850,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value and our current negotiations.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me is $1,200,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering our previous negotiations. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,5,
