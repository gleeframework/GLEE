Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we start at $800,000 and see if we can find some middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $800,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about $850,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value and our current negotiations.
