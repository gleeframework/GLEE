"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to let it go for $100, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows for negotiation room. 
* **Friendly tone:** A positive message might make Bob more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** This price allows for multiple rounds of negotiation, giving me the opportunity to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price. 
* **John is a backup option:** Knowing John is willing to pay $120 provides me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by counter-offering with a price closer to his budget.
* **Negotiation:**  $95 still gives me some profit margin while leaving room for further negotiations.
* **Friendly tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, hoping to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation continues:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open, potentially allowing me to secure a higher price.
* **John as a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're coming up, and I appreciate that.  $90 is closer, but I'm still a little higher. How about we split the difference at $92.50? That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Still profitable:** $92.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Positive tone:** I continue to maintain a friendly and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Splitting the difference:** This tactic can make the offer seem more fair and appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. I'd like to stick to my original budget of $80. Could we meet there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob is not budging from his original offer, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the allotted rounds, and it's unlikely Bob will change his mind.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $120 ensures I receive my minimum desired price. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than risk further negotiation with Bob that may not lead to a better deal."
