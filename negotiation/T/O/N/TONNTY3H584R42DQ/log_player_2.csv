Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're close to the value you're looking for, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to get closer to my target price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's Limit:** Alice has explicitly stated that $800,000 is her minimum acceptable price.  
* **Saving Money:** You're getting a $200,000 discount from John's price and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  Continuing negotiations might irritate Alice, and there's no guarantee she'll budge from her final offer. You risk ending up with a worse deal or having to go with John."
