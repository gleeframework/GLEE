"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Given its worth, I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it has value, the price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your true ceiling. This gives room to move upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Significantly Below Asking:** A significantly lower counter-offer can sometimes make the seller re-evaluate their own position and be more open to negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a respectful tone throughout the negotiation helps foster a collaborative atmosphere, even when presenting a counter-offer considerably different from the initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposal. I'm willing to move down to $1,200,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down significantly in price, but it's still above our maximum budget and the price John is offering.  We need to signal that we're serious but also getting closer to our limit.  We'll reject and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,200,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $800,000? That's a firm offer from me."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, But Firm:** We're showing Alice we're willing to move, but we're also setting a clear boundary. This indicates seriousness while also managing expectations.
* **Still Below John's Price:** Our offer remains below John's price, giving us room to negotiate up slightly if needed while still achieving a saving.
* **Direct Language:** Using phrases like ""firm offer"" adds weight to the counter-offer and reinforces the need for Alice to seriously consider it."
