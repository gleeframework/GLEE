Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it has value, the price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposal. I'm willing to move down to $1,200,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,200,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $800,000? That's a firm offer from me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, his ""firm offer"" of $800,000 is still significantly below both my valuation and what John is willing to pay. It's unlikely Bob will reach $1,000,000, so it's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer."
