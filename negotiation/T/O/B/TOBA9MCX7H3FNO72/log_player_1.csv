Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value you've placed on it at $800,000, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
