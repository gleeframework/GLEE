"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a significant price. Alice is clearly starting high, and you have room to negotiate. It's better to start by rejecting the offer and proposing a counteroffer to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you.  Would you consider $1,150,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, but $1,150,000 is still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price.  There's still room for compromise, and I want to try to find a deal that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value you've placed on it at $800,000, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
