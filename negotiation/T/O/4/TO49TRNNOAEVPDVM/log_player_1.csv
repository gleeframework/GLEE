""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that starting price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $875,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $785,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to John's offer, I'm still willing to negotiate further. Bob clearly sees the value in the product, and I believe I can secure a price closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $850,000. I believe this is a very fair price that reflects the value it will bring you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still interested.  How about $815,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push Bob a bit further, accepting his offer of $815,000 is the safest option at this stage. It exceeds my safety net of $800,000 from John and provides a reasonable profit. Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away altogether."
