"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I'm willing to hold out for a good price.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can do better with further negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.  This should encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's still below my desired profit margin. I have limited rounds left, but I'm confident I can push for a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, aiming to incentivize Bob to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm dropping the price further, but not too much.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  However, I believe that offering a price closer to Bob's last offer will encourage him to come up to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting late in the game, and while I'd like to push for more,  $1,050,000 is a significant profit and a safe bet.  I'm not sure I can get Bob to go higher with the limited rounds left, so I'll accept this offer."
