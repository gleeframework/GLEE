Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,800,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a more than fair price."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a significantly higher price ($1,800,000), you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to your desired outcome than if you started at a lower price.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason for the high price (even if general) can make it seem more reasonable. 

**Important:**  This is a single-round negotiation. In reality, there would likely be back and forth between you and Bob.  This offer aims to maximize your potential gain in this specific scenario."
