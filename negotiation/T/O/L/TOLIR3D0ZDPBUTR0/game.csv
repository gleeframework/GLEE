"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $110. Would you be willing to consider that?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about $115? Let's try to find a price we're both happy with.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $115. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $112 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $113? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",113.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $113 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $111? I think that's the best we can do, and I'm willing to commit to buying the product at that price.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $111 is just a little too low for me. How about we settle at $112? That's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further back and forth.",112.0,Alice,7,
