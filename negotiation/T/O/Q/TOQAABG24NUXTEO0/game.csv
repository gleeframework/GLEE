"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, $110 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $105. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",105.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,108.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $105. I'm willing to compromise at $108, which is just a bit above your last offer. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $108 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $102, which is right in the middle between our last offers. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",102.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,106.0
"I understand that $108 was a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $102. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $106, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",106.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $106 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $104, which is a fair price considering the product's worth and the fact that John is selling it for $100. If you're not willing to go down to that, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer. ",104.0,Bob,8,,

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down to $105. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above John's offer of $100. If you're willing to accept $101, I'll take the product from you.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with John.",101.0,Bob,10,,
