**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Here's why:

* **John's Price is Guaranteed:** You know John will sell the product for $800,000. There's no uncertainty.
* **Time is a Factor:**  You're already on Round 5 of 10. There's a chance you could run out of rounds before getting Alice below $800,000.
* **Small Potential Savings:**  The most you could save by continuing with Alice is $10,000.  It's not worth potentially losing the product or paying more."
