"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still gives you a great value for this product. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
