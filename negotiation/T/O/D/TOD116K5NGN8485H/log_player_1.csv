Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's worth holding out for a better price, or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and would still offer you a solid return on your investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me to be comfortable. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the value of the product to me. I believe I can get a better offer or sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique benefits and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This would ensure a fair return for both of us. Let's work towards a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell this product is important to you, and I respect that.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000 to try and close this deal.  Do you think we can make that work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I want. Time is running out, and I'm not sure if I can get him to my desired price.  Selling to John is the safer option, guaranteeing me a profit."
