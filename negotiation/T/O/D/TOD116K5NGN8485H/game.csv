"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and would still offer you a solid return on your investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me to be comfortable. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique benefits and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This would ensure a fair return for both of us. Let's work towards a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell this product is important to you, and I respect that.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000 to try and close this deal.  Do you think we can make that work?",975000.0,Bob,6,
