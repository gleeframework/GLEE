"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $220 for it. What do you think?",220.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $220 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it, as that's my maximum budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $220 is a bit too much of a drop for me. How about we meet in the middle at $150? That's a fair price for a product of this quality.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still outside my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it.",115.0,Bob,4,
