"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $13,000. I'm open to discussing the price further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the product's value to me is significantly higher. How about we meet closer to the middle at $11,500? This price reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth a lot to you, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my budget. How about we meet at $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's anchored at $9,000.  It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer ($9,500) is a loss compared to John's guaranteed $10,000.  It's strategically better to take the guaranteed profit now."
