Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $100 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 gives Bob the potential feeling of a deal if he negotiates down, while still keeping the price well above your minimum. 
* **Don't undervalue:**  Offering it for $80 or slightly above leaves potential profit on the table. Bob might have been willing to pay more."
