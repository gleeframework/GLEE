Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I understand the value you place on the product, I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I respect the value of the product, I still feel that $800,000 is a fair price based on my budget and needs. I would like to stick to this figure. I hope this proposal is acceptable.

Bob seems firmly rooted at $800,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely to yield a result significantly better than John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.  It makes the most financial sense to take the guaranteed profit."
