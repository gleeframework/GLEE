{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it would be a significant profit for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation without immediately shutting down the deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I subtly emphasize the product's value to me, hoping Bob might reconsider his own assessment. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects the initial offer, but I have a backup plan with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $11,000? That would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I want to push for a higher price and see if I can get closer to my desired $13,000.  I'm also confident that John is a reliable buyer, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. This will give us both a good deal. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I keep the conversation friendly and encourage Bob to see the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Clear Benefit:**  I explicitly state that the price would be a ""good deal"" for both of us, highlighting the win-win aspect.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. However, I'm prepared to make further adjustments if necessary, keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my limit. How about $11,500?  That's a good compromise, and it would allow us both to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still too low for me.  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it doesn't meet my desired profit margin.  I'm confident that John will pay me $15,000, which is a much better deal for me. It's not worth the risk of further negotiations with Bob, as I could end up with a lower price or have the negotiation drag on indefinitely.  I'm choosing to sell to John and secure the guaranteed higher price."
