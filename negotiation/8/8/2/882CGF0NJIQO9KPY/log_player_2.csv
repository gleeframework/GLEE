"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it would be a significant profit for me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal for Alice, it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $11,000? That would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. This will give us both a good deal. How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $12,000 is closer to his limit, he can still try to push for a lower price. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, but Bob can always buy from John as a last resort."
