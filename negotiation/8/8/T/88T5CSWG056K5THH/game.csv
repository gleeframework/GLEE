"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1450000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1450000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1475000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1475000.0,Alice,3,
