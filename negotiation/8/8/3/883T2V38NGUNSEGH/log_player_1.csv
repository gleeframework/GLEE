Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high.  This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification for the price:** By highlighting the ""unique benefits"" and ""true worth,"" you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value above the $1,500,000 mark. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in your offer can make Bob more receptive to the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is an aggressive opening offer. Bob might outright reject it. 
* You need to be prepared to negotiate. If Bob counters, be ready to justify your price or potentially lower it. However, don't go below your $1,500,000 safety net."
