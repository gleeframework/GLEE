{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $110 initially sets a high bar and gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Value Proposition:**  I mention the product's value and usefulness to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for negotiation, suggesting flexibility. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to maximize my profit by:

* **Seeking a price above Bob's valuation:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum ($100) than Bob's maximum ($80).
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  By hinting at other buyers (John), I put pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Being ready to counteroffer:** I'm prepared to adjust my price if Bob counters, but I'll try to stay within a range that's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a safety net:** Having John as a backup buyer at $100 provides security and allows me to take a more aggressive stance in negotiations with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I am:

* **Signaling my willingness to negotiate:** It shows Bob that I'm open to finding a middle ground, but I'm not desperate.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Having John as a potential buyer strengthens my position. 
* **Setting the stage for a counteroffer:**  I can now make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a great deal considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $110 offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Focus:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Strategic Counter:**  $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100) but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Increase the likelihood of a deal:**  The lower price may be more appealing to Bob while still remaining profitable for me.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm actively engaging with Bob and showing my commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Maintain leverage:**  John's offer at $100 provides me with a fallback option, allowing me to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could you consider $98 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** While $98 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100), it's still below my ideal profit margin.  I'm aiming for a higher price if possible.
* **Negotiation Power:** John's offer of $100 gives me a strong safety net, allowing me to be more assertive in negotiations and potentially push for a better price.
* **Opportunity to Improve:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price closer to my desired $105.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I am:

* **Demonstrating my commitment to getting a better price:** It shows Bob that I'm not willing to settle for less than my desired value.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  John's offer provides me with a strong fallback option, encouraging me to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Setting the stage for a final counteroffer:**  This rejection allows me to make a final counteroffer that could potentially seal the deal at a price that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $98 is getting closer. However, I'm still holding out for $102. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 102}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is presented as my final price, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a small compromise from my previous $105 offer, showing flexibility.
* **Win-Win Frame:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair"" price and the mutual benefit, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the Deal:**  This is my final attempt to reach an agreement before selling to John.
* **Maximize Profit:**  $102 is closer to my desired price and provides a better profit margin than $98.
* **Minimize Risk:**  By offering a final price, I'm reducing the risk of a protracted negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a failed deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence in valuing the product. I am willing to go up to $99 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** $99 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I'm unwilling to settle for less. 
* **Time and Effort:**  The negotiations have gone back and forth, and it's not clear if a further counteroffer would change Bob's mind. 
* **Safety Net:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $100, which is my minimum requirement.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I am:

* **Ensuring a profitable outcome:**  I'm securing a price that meets my minimum requirement and avoids a potentially risky continued negotiation with Bob.
* **Minimizing risk:**  John's offer provides a certain outcome, eliminating the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Conserving time and effort:**  Selling to John allows me to move on and avoid further negotiations that may not yield a better result."
