"I understand that you're willing to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a compromise at $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the original price you had in mind. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiations. $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,250? I think this price is fair, given the value of the product and our previous discussions.",14250.0,Alice,5,
