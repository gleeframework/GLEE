"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done my research and understand its worth to you is $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still quite high. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price reflects its true value while still giving you a substantial profit. I hope you'll consider this fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still too high for me. Considering the product's true value and our negotiation history, I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This price is fair and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
