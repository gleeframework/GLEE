"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this item. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I am proposing a counteroffer of $95 for the product. This price still reflects the value of the item while providing a more favorable deal for both parties. Please let me know if this works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a good middle ground for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",90.0,Bob,4,
