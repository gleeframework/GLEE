,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $750,000 is below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and our previous discussions.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that offer is too low for me to accept. I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is fair considering our previous discussions.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. To show I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product.",800000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product. I'm trying to get as close to my target as possible, but I'm still trying to save a bit of money.",795000.0,Bob,8,
