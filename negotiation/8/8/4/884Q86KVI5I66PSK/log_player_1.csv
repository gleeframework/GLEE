Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $750,000 is below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $875,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally decreasing his offer, indicating a potential to reach a more agreeable price. We are still significantly below our minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but that offer is too low for me to accept. I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $825,000?"", 
""product_price"": 825000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're strategically coming down in larger increments to signal some flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to our target. We're leaving room for further negotiation while remaining firm on not devaluing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is fair considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has started to increase his offer amounts, indicating we're getting closer to a price he might accept that's still above his initial offer. We have room to negotiate further and potentially reach a more favorable outcome than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. To show I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're now very close to Bob's initial valuation and pushing for a deal. This offer is firm but fair, signaling we're reaching the limit of our flexibility. This puts the decision firmly in Bob's court to either meet this price or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product. I'm trying to get as close to my target as possible, but I'm still trying to save a bit of money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to meet our lowest acceptable price, even after significant negotiation. He's incrementally increasing his offers, but the gains are too small and time-consuming.  Selling to John guarantees our minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of further stalling tactics from Bob."
