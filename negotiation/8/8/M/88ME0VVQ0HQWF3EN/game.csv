"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. This product has significant potential, and I believe its true value is closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
