Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I think this represents a fair deal considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you can potentially still meet your minimum target. 
* **John as Backup:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob an attractive price."
