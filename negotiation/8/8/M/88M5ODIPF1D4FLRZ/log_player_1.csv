Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a clear incentive to negotiate as he values the product higher.
* **It's not too aggressive:** It doesn't immediately put Bob off by being too close to his maximum value.

Keep in mind, I'm a language model and don't have any real-world experience with negotiation. This is just a starting point and the best offer will depend on your assessment of Bob's personality and your own risk tolerance."
