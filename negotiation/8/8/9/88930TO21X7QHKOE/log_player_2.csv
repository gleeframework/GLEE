"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice first.  $130 is too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's closer to Alice's value but still leaves me room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $117.50? Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but I think there's still room to negotiate. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but not to $117.50."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle on $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
