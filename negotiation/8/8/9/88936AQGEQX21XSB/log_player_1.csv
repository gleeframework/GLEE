Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. It's important to remember that John's offer of $1,500,000 is my safety net, so I don't want to drop too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a good profit.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's lower than I initially hoped, it's still a good profit and higher than John's offer.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
