Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for the maximum value of the product to me. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for potential concessions if Bob counters. It's also a good strategy to see if Bob is truly serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While $800,000 is better than nothing, I believe there's room for negotiation. I will counter with a price closer to my valuation, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering a price that is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a significant portion of my desired value."
