Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the details you've shared about the product's features.  While I recognize its potential value, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product. This would be a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
