"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  This gives me a buffer to potentially lower the price if necessary, while still maximizing my profit.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John's offer of $800,000 gives me a baseline and a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While it's above John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  He's already shown interest by making a counteroffer.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that's closer to my initial price, but still below Bob's perceived value. This will hopefully lead to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Incentive:** I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, showing flexibility. This also incentivizes Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Value:** $900,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer, ensuring that I'm not losing out on potential profit.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, while still giving me room to adjust if necessary in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000,  there's a risk that further negotiations with Bob could stall or even lower his offer.
* **Securing a Profit:** This offer ensures a profit above John's offer and is a reasonable outcome given the current negotiation dynamics.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to secure a deal before time runs out."
