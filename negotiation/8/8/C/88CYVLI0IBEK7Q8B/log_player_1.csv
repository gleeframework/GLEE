{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a high price while keeping the possibility of a deal open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, and offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our interests. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by lowering my price slightly while still aiming for a profitable deal. $950,000 is a more realistic compromise that could potentially lead to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a deal, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $935,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

I'm trying to find a price that's closer to my desired price while still being attractive to Bob.  I believe $935,000 is a good compromise that could lead to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $935,000. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation has gone on for a while, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm not comfortable accepting his offer of $915,000, as it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'd rather sell the product to John for $1,200,000 and ensure I get a fair price for my product."
