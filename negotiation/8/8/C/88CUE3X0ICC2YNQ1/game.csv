"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9500 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go with $10250? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to my minimum value. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I believe $9800 is a fair price for your product. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. $9800 is still a little low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $10000? It's a fair price for you, considering the product's value, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,5,
