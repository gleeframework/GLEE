Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.
