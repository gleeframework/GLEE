"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm quite interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we come down a bit? Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,,
