"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his ideal value of $10,000.  Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point, showing willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is slightly higher than her initial offer. While it's tempting, Bob's still aiming for a lower price.  Rejecting allows for another counteroffer, potentially closing the gap further.  It's important to remember that Bob has 10 rounds, so there's time for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. $11,000 is a reasonable compromise, considering Alice's last offer and Bob's desired price. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, hopefully leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is moving closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal value. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and rejecting this offer allows for another round of counteroffers. There's still room for a better deal, and Bob has time with the 10 round limit. It's risky to accept this offer and might leave Bob feeling like he could have gotten a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing persistence and a willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is a good middle ground between his last offer and Alice's last offer, hopefully leading to a quicker agreement.  With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to be more aggressive while still keeping the price below his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, but it's getting closer. With only 3 rounds left, Bob needs to be strategic. Rejecting this offer allows for one more counteroffer, potentially securing a better price. Accepting risks leaving Bob with a less favorable deal than he could potentially get.  It's a gamble, but it could pay off."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 2 rounds remaining, Bob needs to be bold. This counteroffer is a significant jump from his previous offer but still below Alice's current offer. It shows Bob's willingness to reach a deal while pushing for a lower price. This could be a final attempt to meet in the middle and secure the product at a good price. If Alice rejects, Bob can always resort to buying from John in the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 away from John's price, and we're in the final round. It's too risky to continue negotiating as there's no guarantee Alice will accept Bob's counteroffer. 

Buying from John for $15,000 guarantees the purchase, and it's within Bob's budget.  It's the safest option, as there's no guarantee Alice will meet Bob's desired price in the final round."
