"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $115?  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $125 is a good price for him, and it's still a profitable deal for Alice.  There's no reason to risk losing the deal by continuing to haggle, especially since John is selling the product for $150."
