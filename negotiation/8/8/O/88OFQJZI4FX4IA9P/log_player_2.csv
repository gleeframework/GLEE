"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've put a lot of effort into, and I know it aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000, which is a price I feel is fair considering its worth. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to consider her offer since it's only slightly over, rejecting her offer and purchasing from John will save you $50,000."
