"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
