{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to accept it at this stage. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $14,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $16,500 is a better offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $15,500 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and it's more than what I'd get from John. I'll accept his offer."
