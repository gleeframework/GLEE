Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair price, and I'm eager to make a deal.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. How about we try $85? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal on the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $80. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about $87.50? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",87.5,Alice,7,
