Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my initial price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial price, $13,500 is a good deal.  It's more than what I would get from John, and it seems like Bob is willing to go no higher."
