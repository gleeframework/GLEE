Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $10,900 for it. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her final offer. Accepting the offer for $10,900 saves him $100 compared to buying from John, and it's still within his budget.  The risk of continuing negotiations is that Alice might withdraw her offer entirely, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price."
