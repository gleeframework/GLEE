"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
