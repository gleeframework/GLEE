"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1000000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me and your initial offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $950000. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $950000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
