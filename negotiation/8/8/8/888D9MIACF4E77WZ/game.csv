"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the competitive price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  This price is still above your value for it, and it allows for some room for us to reach a deal that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
