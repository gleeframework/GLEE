Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding that the product has value, but I'm on a budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and it's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $10,000 minimum. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is a better outcome than risking further negotiation with Bob."
