"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price. I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and can always sell to John if I don't get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding onto a significant profit margin.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm also not desperate to sell, as I have the option of selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm narrowing the gap further, but still keeping some room for negotiation. Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm not willing to settle yet.  I still have 5 rounds left and John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  Bob's offer of $15,200 is above my minimum value of $15,000, and it's likely I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds. I'm happy to accept and secure the sale."
