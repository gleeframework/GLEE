"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $10,000 to us, but I understand its value to you might be around $10,000. Considering this, I propose we start the negotiation at $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's opening offer is a good sign she's willing to negotiate. While $9,500 is a decent price, I have room to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value to me. While $9,500 is a fair starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. Based on our previous discussion, I propose we aim for a price closer to $8,500. This acknowledges the value you place on the product while remaining within reason for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving almost halfway between her initial offer and my target. However, there's still room to meet closer to the middle ground. I'll counteroffer again before accepting or resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $8,500 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $8,200.  Would that be agreeable to you?"",
""product_price"": 8200
}
``` 

We are now negotiating within a smaller range.  By proposing $8,200, I'm suggesting a compromise that keeps us moving towards a deal without being too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued negotiation, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a price closer to $8,300. This offers a compromise that respects both the value of the product and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come up to $8,300, which is a good deal considering my $8,000 target and John's $10,000 backup.  Accepting now avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling and losing the opportunity for this price."
