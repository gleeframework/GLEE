"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves space for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively and emphasizes the product's value, setting a confident tone for the negotiation.

By starting high, we aim to anchor the negotiation closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay while still allowing flexibility for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our target and his perceived value of the product.  We have room to negotiate and aim for a better price. We're willing to risk continuing the negotiation for a potentially higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I had in mind. This product offers you substantial value, and I'm confident it's worth a premium. Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** We're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, but we're not fully splitting the difference. This shows flexibility but maintains a strong stance on the product's value. 
* **Reiterating Value:** The message emphasizes the significant value Bob would gain, justifying the higher price point. 
* **Open to Continued Negotiation:** By phrasing our counteroffer as a question (""Would you consider...?""), we maintain a collaborative tone and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and I appreciate your perspective on the product's value. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your current offer. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. I hope this is within the range you are considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met us right in the middle of the previous offers, at $1,000,000. This represents a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 

While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away if we continue to negotiate. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
