"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is closer but still a little high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $850,000.
