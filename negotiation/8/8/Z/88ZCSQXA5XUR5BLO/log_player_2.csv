"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $99. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $99 is too high for you. You're better off going with John's offer of $80."
