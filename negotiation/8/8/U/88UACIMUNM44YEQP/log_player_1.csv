Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to me, I'll offer it to him for $90.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is $85, which is lower than what I was hoping to get. Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, I think he's being reasonable. However, I'm not willing to give it away for that price.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. I'll send him a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer.
