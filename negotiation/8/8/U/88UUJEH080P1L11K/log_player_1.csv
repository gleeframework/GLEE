Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
 
While $7,500 is better than selling to John, I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,750? I'm confident this price is fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $8,200 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and closer to my desired price than John's offer.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
