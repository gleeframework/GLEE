We still have room to negotiate and Bob seems anchored at $1,200,000. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher."

Round 6

It's becoming clear that Bob is firmly anchored at $1,200,000.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Since John is offering our minimum acceptable price, it's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale."
