"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,
