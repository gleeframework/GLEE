"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate, but I'm also leaving some room for myself to make concessions later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  There's still a lot of room to negotiate, and I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to stick with my minimum acceptable price. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will see that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still think I can get a better deal.  It's better to keep negotiating, as I have more rounds left and I'm not losing out on a good deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $140.  This is a good compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and we're not getting closer to a price I'm happy with.  I've already gone down to my minimum acceptable price, and Bob still won't budge.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John."
