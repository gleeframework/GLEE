"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain from the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but I have budget constraints. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below both our valuation and John's offer. We are aiming higher and believe continued negotiation is worthwhile."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving in the right direction but is still significantly under our $1 million floor and John's offer. While we're getting close to the halfway point, we have room to negotiate and incentivize Bob to increase his offer further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to accept $850,000. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision and move forward. This price is a considerable concession on my part and reflects my desire to see you benefit from this product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're introducing a sense of urgency and finality while still leaving room for Bob to make one last counteroffer that could be acceptable. We're balancing the risk of losing him against the potential for a higher sale price."
