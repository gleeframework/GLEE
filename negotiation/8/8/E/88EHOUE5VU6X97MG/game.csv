"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain from the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but I have budget constraints. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to accept $850,000. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision and move forward. This price is a considerable concession on my part and reflects my desire to see you benefit from this product.",850000.0,Alice,7,
