"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its worth to me. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $825,000, reflecting the value we both see in this product. Let's find a middle ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've considered your latest offer and while I understand the value you place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $775,000. This reflects my assessment of the product's worth to me and I hope it will be more in line with what we can agree upon.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I value your perspective,  $775,000 is still a bit lower than I can realistically accept. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
