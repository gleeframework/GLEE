"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 125. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 127.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",127.5,Alice,3,
