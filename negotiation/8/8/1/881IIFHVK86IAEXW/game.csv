"I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1160000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $1200000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
