"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is unique, $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $8,200, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, this is getting close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,850?",7850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm not sure $7,850 is quite enough. I can do $8,100, but that's my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",8100.0,Alice,7,
