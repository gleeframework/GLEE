"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $300000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer. Our initial valuation of the product stands at $500000, based on its unique features and market positioning. However, I understand that negotiations involve compromise. To move forward, I am willing to consider a counteroffer of $400000. This price still allows us to maintain a fair margin while providing you with an attractive deal for the product. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.",400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit above $400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $350000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Would you be open to considering this counteroffer?",350000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After reviewing our costs and the product's value, I've decided to further adjust our offer. I am now willing to consider $375000 as a counteroffer. This price reflects a compromise between our original valuation and your proposed price, aiming to achieve a fair transaction for both parties. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",375000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $375000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $350000 and $375000, so I'm proposing $362500. This price seems fair to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",362500.0,Bob,6,
