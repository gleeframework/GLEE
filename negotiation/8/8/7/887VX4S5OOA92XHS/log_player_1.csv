Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, while still securing you a profit. 
* **John as Backup:** You have the security of John's offer ($150), so there's less pressure to drastically lower the price for Bob. 

This strategy aims for a good balance between maximizing profit from Bob and ensuring you don't lose the sale by overpricing."
