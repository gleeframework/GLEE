"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but the price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we try to close the gap a bit faster? I'm willing to go up to $10,000 if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, but I think $11,250 is the lowest I can go. How about that?",11250.0,Alice,7,
