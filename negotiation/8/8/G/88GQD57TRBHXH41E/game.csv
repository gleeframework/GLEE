"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,700,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This amount still allows me to invest in the product while staying within my financial limits.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a significant compromise.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us to both benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. This amount still keeps the deal within my financial limits while acknowledging the value of the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
