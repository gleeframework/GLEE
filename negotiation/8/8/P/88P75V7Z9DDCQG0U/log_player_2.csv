It's not worth paying more than your maximum price.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal with Alice."

I'm offering $140, which is still a fair price for Alice considering her value of $150.  Let's see if she's willing to budge a bit."

Alice is coming down a little, but it's still over my limit.  Let's see if we can get her closer to my offer."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying below my maximum. Hopefully, Alice sees this as a good compromise."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

While $155 is getting close, it's still over my budget.  I'm going to buy the product from John.  There's no sense in continuing to negotiate with Alice if I can get a better deal elsewhere."
