"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The $50,000 difference allows space for negotiation while staying well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Professionalism:**  The tone is positive and invites discussion, which is important for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me though.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both my minimum ($800,000) and his perceived value of the product. Accepting would leave a significant amount of money on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is considerably below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession of $50,000 to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further.
* **Holding Firm:** However, the new price of $900,000 still maintains a significant margin above my minimum and keeps the pressure on Bob to move closer to my desired range. 
* **Justification:**  I've reiterated the product's value to justify the higher price and make it clear I'm not willing to settle for a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we meet halfway at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk he might walk away, and I'd be left with John's offer, which is the same. It's a good deal, and accepting now secures the sale."
