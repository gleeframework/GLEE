Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message:** I'm being friendly and direct, highlighting the value to Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest while still protecting my minimum price. If Bob rejects, I can use his counteroffer to determine his maximum price. I can then adjust my counteroffers accordingly, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll use his offer as a guide, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll also keep John's offer in mind, knowing I can always sell to him for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $950,000 is a bit lower than I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value you've expressed and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin.
* **The message:** I'm being respectful and acknowledging Bob's perspective, but I'm also firm in my desire for a price closer to my value.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this price and accept. If he rejects again, I'll be prepared to further adjust my counteroffer, but I'll keep John's offer of $1,200,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I am willing to negotiate, but I'm not comfortable accepting a price that is significantly lower than my product's value.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll continue to use his offer as a guide and adjust my counteroffers accordingly. I will also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $1,020,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,020,000:** This price is a further compromise, closer to Bob's latest offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own value. 
* **The message:** I am remaining polite and encouraging further negotiation. I am acknowledging Bob's perspective but also reiterating the value of the product to him. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to inch closer to a potential agreement. If Bob rejects again, I can further adjust my counteroffer or consider selling to John. However, I am optimistic that this offer might be enough to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think I can do better. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer of $990,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Negotiations seem to be dragging on, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal with John.

**Why Sell to John?**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a price that guarantees my desired profit margin and exceeds my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a slightly higher price, but it risks wasting time and potentially leading to a stalemate.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  I've already demonstrated my willingness to negotiate, but Bob's reluctance to move significantly further suggests he may not be serious about acquiring the product at a fair price.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John is the most logical decision at this point. It ensures a profitable outcome and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
