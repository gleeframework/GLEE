"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  $12,000 is a significant amount for Bob, but it's still considerably less than the product's worth to him. This will give me a good starting point for the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can do better. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $11,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's more likely to be acceptable to Bob.  It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still holding out for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $10,500. This is a compromise, but I'm confident that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway at this point. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe this is a fair offer that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $9,800. This is a very slight reduction from my previous offer, and I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that we're nearing an agreement. I'm confident that this offer is fair, and I'm willing to close the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call, as I'm not getting my desired price.  However,  I only have 2 rounds left, and  $8,800 is much closer to my minimum than John's offer.  It's also likely Bob won't budge further, so it's better to secure this profit than risk losing the deal entirely."
