"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but also be realistic about Bob's potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you considering me for this product. Unfortunately, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm not ready to settle for that just yet. I believe I can get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $12,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $12,750.  It's the highest I can go right now. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's a good deal considering I have limited rounds and John is only offering $12,000.  I'll take the $12,750 and close the deal."
