{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $920,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 920000}"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to make a strong case for why I think $900,000 is a fair price. I'll also mention that I'm getting close to buying from John, which might motivate Alice to reconsider.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you think the product is worth a lot, but I'm starting to think that buying from John for $800,000 might be a better option for me. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay.
