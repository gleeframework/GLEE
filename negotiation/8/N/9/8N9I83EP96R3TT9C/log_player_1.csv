I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it meets my minimum price, I'd like to try and get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, hopefully encouraging him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob seems unwilling to budge from his price.  Since I'm guaranteed the minimum amount from John, I'm going to sell to him now. It's not my ideal outcome, but it ensures I get a good deal without the risk of further negotiation."
