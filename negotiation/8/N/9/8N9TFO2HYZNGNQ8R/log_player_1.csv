Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it allows room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding my minimum value. It also demonstrates confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's likely Bob will see this as a more reasonable price than my initial offer, making it more probable that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000. While I could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee he'll budge further. Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I meet my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
