"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum desired price, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows for a good profit.  If Bob rejects, we can continue to negotiate. I'm confident I can reach a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $8,500, I believe I can do better.  I'm confident that I can reach a price closer to my desired $10,000 through further negotiations.  I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll be happy with."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,600?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $8,600 is still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum desired price of $10,000 that I'm willing to accept it.  We've reached a compromise, and it's better to secure the sale now rather than risk further negotiation rounds."
