"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and framing the price as fair.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and makes it clear that I'm open to negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for showing me the product, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a little too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price, so I'll counteroffer in the next round. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:** While John offers a guaranteed $80, I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my minimum ($80) and Bob's offer ($70). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to see the value in the offer.
* **Highlighting the product's worth:** Reminding Bob of the product's value could sway him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to go down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, which is a good sign.
* **Seeking a higher price:** I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price point with another counteroffer.
* **Maintaining the deal with Bob:** I'd rather try to close the deal with Bob than settle for John's lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's try $80. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm offering my absolute minimum, making it clear that I'm serious about closing the deal. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $80, hoping he'll recognize the value.
* **Direct question:**  Asking ""What do you say?"" encourages a quick decision. 

This approach aims to close the deal while still getting my minimum price. If Bob rejects, it's time to seriously consider John's offer."
