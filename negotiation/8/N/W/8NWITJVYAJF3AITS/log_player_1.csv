"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $110, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  Since he values the product at $80, there's some room for negotiation.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $100, so I'm not afraid to lose this deal if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price of $100. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm dropping my price to $95. This is still above my minimum of $100, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this price is attractive enough for him to accept, but it's also a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $85. Although it's still below my minimum, it's getting closer to my desired price and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John.  Additionally, we're already in round 4, leaving less room for further negotiation."
