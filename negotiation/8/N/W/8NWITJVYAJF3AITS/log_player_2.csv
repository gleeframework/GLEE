{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is far too expensive. I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm offering Alice $80 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, as it's the price I can get it for elsewhere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}

I'm willing to go up to $85. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me and the price I can get it for from John."
