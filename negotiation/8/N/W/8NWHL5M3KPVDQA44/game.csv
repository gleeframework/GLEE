"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is considerably below the product's true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from this unique product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $975,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite a ways apart. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. I'm willing to make one more move to $1,000,000, but this is my final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end and acknowledges your interest in the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more move, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
