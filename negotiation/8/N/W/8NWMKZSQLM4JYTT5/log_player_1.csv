Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell now, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired $8,000 with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to stay above $8,000. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my bottom line."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider $8,200 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $8,500, $8,200 is still a good price and a fair compromise. It's within my desired range and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for a higher price."
