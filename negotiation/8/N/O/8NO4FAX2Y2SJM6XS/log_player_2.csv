"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to sell the product for $10,000, so offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $12,000, but still above Alice's minimum selling price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing you to save a substantial amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for you. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and you having to buy from John at a much higher price is too high."
