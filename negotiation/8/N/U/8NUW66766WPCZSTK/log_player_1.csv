Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** Bob could make a profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) if he buys from you at your minimum.

**The Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that potential profit as possible. Offering the product for exactly $1,000,000 leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial opportunity. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing mutual benefit and value. 
* **Price:** $1,150,000 allows Bob to still make a $50,000 profit while you secure an extra $150,000 compared to your deal with John.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** This offer assumes Bob is a rational actor.  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a strong long-term relationship with Bob is paramount, you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure he feels like he got a good deal.
