"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation, but $10,750 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,900.  I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for your business, and this price reflects its true worth.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,900 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $10,700, which is the maximum I can afford. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",10700.0,Bob,6,
