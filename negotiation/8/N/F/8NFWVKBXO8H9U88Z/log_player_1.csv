Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for my budget, I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to let it go for $925,000.  This is a fair offer reflecting the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 925000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still pretty far apart on price. I could potentially go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

}
```

**Reasoning:** While we could continue negotiating with Bob, his counteroffers are increasing slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach our minimum price of $800,000 within the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed $800,000, ensuring we don't lose money. It's strategically safer to sell to John at this point."
