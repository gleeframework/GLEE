"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the product's worth to Bob to make him more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Open to discussion:** My message ends with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the conversation. 

This approach aims to maximize my profit while leaving open the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product.  There's still room for negotiation.
* **Exploring higher offers:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially achieve a price closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:** I'll need to carefully consider a counteroffer that's both attractive to Bob but also sufficiently high for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the value this product holds for you, and it gives us both a chance to make this deal work. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (sort of):**  This counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's $600,000, but still below my initial offer of $1,000,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value again:**  I reiterate that the product holds value for Bob, justifying the price.
* **Seeking common ground:** I explicitly mention finding common ground, encouraging further negotiation and a potential deal.

By making this counteroffer, I'm aiming to:

* **Maintain a high selling price:**  $850,000 is still closer to my desired value.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  This shows Bob I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm not willing to give away the product cheaply.
* **Increase the chances of a deal:**  A counteroffer shows commitment and allows for further negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $850,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000. It's a fair offer considering its true value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  There's still room for further compromise.
* **Exploring higher offers:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially achieve a price closer to my desired value. I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:** I'll need to carefully consider a counteroffer that's appealing to Bob, but also reflects the product's worth to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value the product holds for you while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price, highlighting that it benefits both parties. This can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal while still ensuring a decent profit for me.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's see if we can finalize this deal"" adds a slight sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

By making this counteroffer, I am:

* **Getting closer to my desired value:** $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Maintaining a strong negotiation position:** I haven't given in to Bob's lower offers but have demonstrated a willingness to compromise. 
* **Increasing the likelihood of a deal:** This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I also have other options, keeping the pressure on him to reach an agreement."
