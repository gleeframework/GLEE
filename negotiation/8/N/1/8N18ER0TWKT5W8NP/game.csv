"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product though.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. However, $10000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $17500. This reflects the value and quality of the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $17500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, so I hope we can find a solution.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $15000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down further.  While $15000 is closer, I'm still at my limit of $12000.  This is the best I can do, and I truly believe this product is worth it. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,6,
