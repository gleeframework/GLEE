"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is less than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $87 is a good deal for you. It's lower than John's price of $100 and is getting close to your target price of $80. Continuing to negotiate might save you a few dollars, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and then increasing the price again is too high.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
