Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. 
* This is a price that is higher than Bob's valuation of $8,000 but lower than my valuation of $12,000.
* This gives Bob a potential profit of $3,000 if he buys it, which might be enough to incentivize him to accept. 
* It also gives me a profit of $1,000, which is better than selling to John for $12,000.

This offer represents a compromise that attempts to maximize my profit while still giving Bob a good deal."
