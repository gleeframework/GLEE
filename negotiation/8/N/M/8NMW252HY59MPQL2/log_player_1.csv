Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is tempting, I believe the true value of this product is closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $925,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about we meet at $915,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

While we could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium for the product, and $915,000 is a strong offer. It's always possible negotiations could stall or Bob could lowball in future rounds. Accepting now secures a significant profit."
