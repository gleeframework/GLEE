"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $8,500 is too low for me at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This still leaves you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let me know your thoughts.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit rich for my blood. How about we try $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $8,750 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,000, which would be $8,500. I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",8500.0,Bob,6,
