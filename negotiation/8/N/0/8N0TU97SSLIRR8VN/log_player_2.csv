Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but I still think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000.  While you might be able to haggle a little more, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of her sticking to her price or the deal falling through. Accepting the $13,000 is a good compromise."
