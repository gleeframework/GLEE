Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150} 
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum acceptable price:** I need to make at least $120, so this is my starting point.
* **Potential upside:** I'm offering a higher price to Bob in the hopes that the product is worth more to him than $120. 
* **Risk mitigation:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, so I'm not risking losing money. 

This offer balances the need to maximize profit with the need to secure a sale."
