Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we compromise at $9,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'll reject Bob's offer. $8,750 is closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can push for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,750 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $8,900. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is the best deal I've gotten so far, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John or going through more rounds of negotiation. $8,800 is a decent profit, and I'm happy with it."
