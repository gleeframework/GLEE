Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale and still net a good profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still represents potential savings compared to your guaranteed offer from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. You can then decide if you want to accept a slightly lower price or hold firm at $14,000."
