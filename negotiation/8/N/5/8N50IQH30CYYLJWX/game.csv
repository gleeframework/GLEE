"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm very interested in this product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1000000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to acquire this amazing product within my means. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also takes into account your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1250000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1125000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this transaction quickly.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1125000. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
