Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also takes into account your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still more than you're comfortable with. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1125000. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.

Alice is now only $200,000 away from your target price, but it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it's time to cut your losses and move on."
