"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $80 for the product, what do you think?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has offered your absolute minimum acceptable price. There's no room for negotiation upwards, and you're guaranteed to get your desired amount from John. It's better to take the sure thing than risk Bob not increasing his offer in subsequent rounds."
