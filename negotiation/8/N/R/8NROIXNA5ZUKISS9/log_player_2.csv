"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $130 for it. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive the best deal while also compensating me fairly for my investment and efforts. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice's offer of $130 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John if needed. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to secure the sale."
