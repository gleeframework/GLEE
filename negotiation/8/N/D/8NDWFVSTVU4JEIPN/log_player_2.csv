"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $65 just yet. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $72. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $70. Accepting the $72 offer secures a decent discount from both Alice's original price and John's offer.  It's a reasonable compromise to avoid the risk of the negotiation breaking down and having to pay the full $80."
