"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but I'm not sure I can justify $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a lower offer than Alice's, but it's still within the realm of possibility for a successful deal. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, knowing that Alice might counteroffer. This approach avoids immediately closing the deal at a price that's too high for me.
* **Avoid Rejection:** By offering a lower price, I'm less likely to be rejected immediately. Alice might be willing to negotiate from this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, but I'm not going to exceed that.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  If that's acceptable, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget. I've made it clear that I'm serious about buying the product but won't go any higher.
* **Urgency:** I've added a sense of urgency by mentioning ""other options.""  This might encourage Alice to accept the offer. 
* **Clear Communication:** I'm explicitly stating my price point and what will happen if it's not accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above my budget of $1,000,000. It's clear we won't be able to agree on a price.  Since John is offering the product at my desired price, it's more advantageous to buy from him and avoid further negotiations."
