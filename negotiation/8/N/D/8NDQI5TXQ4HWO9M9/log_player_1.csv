Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's still a significant amount above my minimum price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not eager to sell at that price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It gives Bob a chance to come up a bit while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 less than my initial counteroffer of $1,300,000.  I'm willing to accept this, as it's still a significant amount more than my minimum price and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer."
