Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you should aim to get more from Bob if possible.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $175 represents a reasonable markup from your minimum acceptable price ($150) while still being potentially attractive to Bob, given the product's value to him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a slightly higher offer allows you some room to potentially negotiate down if Bob hesitates. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
