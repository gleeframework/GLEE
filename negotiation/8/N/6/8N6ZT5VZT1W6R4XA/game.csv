"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on the product and provides a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $950,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and provides a good compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price. I'm prepared to pay $925,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price reflecting its value and allowing for a successful transaction. I'm confident this offer is reasonable and a good stepping stone towards a final agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for. My next counteroffer is $975,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise and reflects the product's value, while also being closer to your target price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $940,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you'll consider this final offer to close the deal.",940000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $975,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $940,000, which is $957,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",957500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I've been willing to compromise throughout our negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $957,500.
