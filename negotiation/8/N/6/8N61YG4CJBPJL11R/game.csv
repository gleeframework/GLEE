"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,500. This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, could we meet somewhere in between, perhaps at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I want to make this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to find common ground. Given my budget constraints, could we aim for $10,750? This would allow us to reach a satisfactory agreement.",10750.0,Bob,6,
