"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below both what the product is worth to me and its potential value to him. I will aim higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price."",
""product_price"": 1100000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting ensures I make a profit and don't risk losing the sale to John's standing offer."
