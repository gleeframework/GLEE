Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $95 is more than your $80 minimum, so you're already in a good position. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're leaving some space for Bob to counteroffer without you feeling pressured to accept a lower price immediately. 
* **It's not too aggressive:**  $95 is closer to your minimum than to Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll at least consider it. 

Remember, the goal is to get as much as possible, but also to be strategic in your negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer $85 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is close to your minimum, you can likely do better. Since Bob is already showing interest, it's worth pushing for a higher price. By rejecting his offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested. While $85 is tempting, I'm aiming for a bit closer to my initial price. How about we settle at $90? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to keep within my budget. Would it be possible to consider $87 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $87 isn't your ideal price, it's a good compromise.  You're close to your minimum and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to Bob walking away. Accepting his offer ensures you get a reasonable price and avoids the chance of ending up with the lower $80 from John."
