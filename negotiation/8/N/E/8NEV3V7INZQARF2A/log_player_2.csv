"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm personally very attached to, and I wouldn't sell it for less than $10,000. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000, recognizing its potential worth to your needs.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I think the $12,000 price is still too high for me. I'll consider buying the product from John for $15,000 if Alice's offer is not acceptable.
