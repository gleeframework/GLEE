"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but it's still above your budget.  You've already made a counteroffer and been rejected, indicating a potential impasse. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price point.  There's no guarantee that you'll be able to get Alice to come down further, so it's safer to go with the sure thing."
