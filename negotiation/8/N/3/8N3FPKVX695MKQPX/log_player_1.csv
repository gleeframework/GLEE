Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so that's my baseline.
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $800,000 provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed that amount.
* **Room for negotiation:**  By offering $950,000, I leave room for potential negotiation with Bob.  He might be willing to pay a higher price if the product is particularly valuable to him. 

**Risk:**

* There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but I've factored in John's offer to mitigate that risk. 
* It's a balance between maximizing my profit and not pricing myself out of the market."
