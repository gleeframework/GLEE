{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth much more to me. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is still more than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for you to potentially compromise if Bob makes a lower counteroffer. 
* **It's a significant discount:**  This makes the offer enticing to Bob, increasing the likelihood of a deal. 

By starting with this offer, I can assess Bob's interest and gauge how much he's willing to pay. I can then adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to a price that works for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I still have the option of selling to John for a much better price.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and try one more time to counteroffer. I'm hoping that showing I'm willing to negotiate will convince Bob to come closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is my final offer, as it's getting close to my minimum. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $10250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $10,250 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to go any lower.  I've already made several concessions and I'm at my limit.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
