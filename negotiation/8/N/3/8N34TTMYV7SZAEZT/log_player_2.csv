# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,375,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  While $1,350,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to accept $1,360,000 as a final offer. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,360,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,360,000 is a good compromise. It's within my budget and significantly lower than her initial price.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting her offer secures the product at a fair price."
