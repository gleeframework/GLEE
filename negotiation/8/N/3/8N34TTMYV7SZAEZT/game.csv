"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,375,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,375,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  While $1,350,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to accept $1,360,000 as a final offer. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1360000.0,Alice,5,
