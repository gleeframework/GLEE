"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider it?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider it?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1520000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1520000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $1520000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1450000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider it?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1600000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up more value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but that's as low as I can go. I'm offering it to you for $1520000. This is my final offer.",1520000.0,Alice,7,
