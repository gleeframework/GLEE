"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm looking for a price around $15,000 to make this work. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is closer to my bottom line. Could you meet me halfway at $13,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I truly hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,500 is close, but I need to be closer to $12,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,750 is getting closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can try to negotiate further or buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to be close to $12,000, but $11,750 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,250. This is my final offer, and I really hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250}
