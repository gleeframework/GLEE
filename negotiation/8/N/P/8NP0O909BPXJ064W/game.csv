"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm looking for a price around $15,000 to make this work. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is closer to my bottom line. Could you meet me halfway at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I truly hope we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,500 is close, but I need to be closer to $12,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to be close to $12,000, but $11,750 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,250. This is my final offer, and I really hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Bob,6,
