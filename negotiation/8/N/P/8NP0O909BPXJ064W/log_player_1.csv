Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I truly hope we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,500 is close, but I need to be closer to $12,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750?"", ""product_price"": 11750}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to be close to $12,000, but $11,750 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,250. This is my final offer, and I really hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250

Bob is unlikely to go above his last offer, and it's clear we've reached an impasse. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
