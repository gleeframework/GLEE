"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000? I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
