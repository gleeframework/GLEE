"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob doesn't accept. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential range for this product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000, and I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is still above my minimum value but lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to go too far below my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject the offer.  It's important to keep in mind that I have 6 rounds left.  I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to settle for $9,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $11,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a price above my minimum threshold. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up with a counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale than to risk a counteroffer from Bob that could be lower or to sell to John for the same price.  It's important to remember that we only have four rounds remaining, and the risk of not reaching an agreement increases with each passing round."
