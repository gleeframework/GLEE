{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its true value to me. I'm confident you'll find this price attractive, considering the value you'll derive from the product. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a profit for me.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will gain, making the offer seem more attractive. I'm also leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts.
* **Why not go lower?** If I go too low, I risk leaving too much money on the table.  My goal is to maximize profit, and John's offer provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount you're providing. However, I believe we can reach an even better agreement. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1200000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to earn.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.

I'll  try to push for a price closer to $1,400,000 in my counteroffer, knowing that I can always accept John's offer of $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value this product holds and the significant discount I'm already offering, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price represents a good compromise and a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, which is a compromise, but still significantly above Bob's offer and closer to my target.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while reiterating the value of the product and the discount I'm already offering. I'm framing it as a compromise to make the offer more appealing and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Negotiation:**  By setting a price close to my desired outcome and emphasizing the compromise, I hope to reach an agreement that's beneficial to both parties. 

This counteroffer balances the need to gain a reasonable profit with the desire to avoid a stalemate and potentially secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to meet somewhere in between our offers. How about we agree on $1300000 for the product? I believe this price respects the value of the product while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,350,000. While it's still a bit lower than my initial target,  it's a fair price and within my acceptable range. I'd rather secure the deal with Bob now rather than risk further negotiations or potentially having to sell to John at a lower price.  

Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
