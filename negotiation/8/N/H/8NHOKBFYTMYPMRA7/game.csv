"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the unique opportunity this product presents.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, my budget caps out at $750,000 for this. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $750,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,5,
