"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic, but it's important to leave room for negotiation in case Bob rejects the offer.  I want to see if I can get a higher price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. I believe I can get closer to my desired price, especially since I'm not under pressure to sell to Bob. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm offering $875,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough. I want to see if we can close the deal for a higher amount. I'm confident in the product's value and I'm not in a rush to sell, so I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm still negotiating but also willing to meet him halfway. With limited rounds remaining, I want to see if this is a price he's willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I want to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal for a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 835000}
```

I'm offering $835,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm still willing to negotiate but also emphasizing that I'm not going to drop my price too much further. We're running out of rounds, and I want to see if we can reach a compromise before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough decision. While I'd like to get more than $800,000 for the product, I'm running out of time and rounds. If I reject Bob's offer, it's very unlikely I'll be able to get a higher price from him in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a good price, and it's the safest option in this situation."
