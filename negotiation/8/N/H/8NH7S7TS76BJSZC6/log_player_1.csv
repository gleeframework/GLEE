Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good middle ground between my minimum value and Bob's estimated value. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a good profit.  I'm also trying to build rapport by being friendly and expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $90, which is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $85 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial target of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference at $87.50?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a great product."", ""product_price"": 87.50} 
```

I'm offering $87.50, which is exactly in the middle of Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price point.  I'm highlighting the fairness of the offer and emphasizing the benefits for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $82.50 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $82.50 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $85. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm offering $85, which is in the middle of our last two offers. This shows continued willingness to compromise while trying to get a more favorable price for myself. I'm also emphasizing the urgency of closing the deal to see if that can push Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I have a limited number of rounds left. If I reject his offer, there's a risk that we won't be able to reach an agreement, and I'll have wasted several rounds. It's better to secure the sale to John at my minimum price than to risk getting nothing at all."
