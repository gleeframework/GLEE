Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This gives me a profit of $10, while still being a potentially appealing price for Bob as the product is worth $120 to him.  If he rejects, I'll see if I can negotiate further, but I'm ready to sell to John for $120 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's not enough for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'm still willing to sell to John for $120, so I have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $115. It's a compromise, but still gives me a small profit. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $112 is closer to my minimum, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation. I'm not confident I'll get a better offer from Bob, and John is a sure thing. I'll sell to John for $120."
