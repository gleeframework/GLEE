Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is simply too high for me. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation.  I understand your initial offer, but I believe it significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I'm confident this price reflects the immense value it holds."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but the gap is still too wide for me.  To be clear, I think this product has value, but  $1,200,000 is not feasible. I could go as high as $750,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and is moving closer to a reasonable price. While John represents a ""safe"" $1,000,000, there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here, and I respect your position.  Let's bridge this gap. How about we settle at $1,000,000?  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I'm willing to go for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer ($750,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,200,000).
* **Firm but Fair:** By stating it's my final offer, I signal seriousness and urgency, but the $1,000,000 is still a fair price that ensures I don't lose money. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're past the halfway point in the rounds. Setting a firm limit now pushes Bob towards a decision."
