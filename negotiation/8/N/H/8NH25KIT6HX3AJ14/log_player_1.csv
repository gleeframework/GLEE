Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I am only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm unable to go above $15,000 for this product. Would you be open to meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is firm at $15,000, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which matches Bob's highest offer. Accepting John's offer avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob failing."
