Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is too low, and I'm willing to risk going another round.  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
