{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $80?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, which is a 27% discount from the original price. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for explaining Alice.  I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not ready to meet you at $95 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $105, which is still a discount from the original price, but I think it's a more reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100, and it's not worth risking missing out on John's offer.  You can save $5 by going with John."
