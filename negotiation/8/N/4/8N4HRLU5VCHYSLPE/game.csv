"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, which is a 27% discount from the original price. Is that something you'd be interested in?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for explaining Alice.  I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not ready to meet you at $95 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $105, which is still a discount from the original price, but I think it's a more reasonable compromise. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
