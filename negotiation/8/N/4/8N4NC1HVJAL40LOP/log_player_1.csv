"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above your minimum acceptable value. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, we're only in Round 2. There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal than $12,000 from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility but Hold Firm:** By coming down in price, we demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, the counteroffer is still significantly above both Bob's offer and John's price, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Highlight Value:** Re-emphasize the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the higher price and potentially nudge him closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's my final offer. I think we're getting close, and I'd like to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has increased his offer significantly from his initial $12,000 and has labeled it his ""final offer."" This suggests he's serious about buying and unlikely to move much higher. 
* **Profitable Deal:** Accepting $13,500 secures a $1,500 profit over John's guaranteed $12,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might walk away.  While a higher price is possible, it's not guaranteed, and we risk losing the current profit margin. 
 
It's a good idea to accept this offer as it represents a solid profit and a reasonable compromise in the negotiation."
