# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than $1,500,000.
* **You still save money:** Even at $1,200,000, you are purchasing the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
