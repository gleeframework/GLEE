Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than John. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a high price that still offers Bob a significant discount ($50,000) compared to what the product is worth to him. This creates a sense of urgency and potential for a win-win.
* **Alternative Buyer:** By mentioning other buyers, I subtly remind Bob that this opportunity won't last forever, encouraging a quicker decision."
