"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to what I have in mind, there's still a gap. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
