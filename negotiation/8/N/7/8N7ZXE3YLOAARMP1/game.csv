"Bob, I understand that $500000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1200000, which is a significant discount from the initial offer. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $800000.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still a bit away from your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $1100000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. However, I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure how much lower I can go.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're willing to meet me at a price that's closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1200000, which is the same as my previous offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling to John for the guaranteed $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $1200000. However, I'm willing to make one last concession. I can meet you in the middle at $1175000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling to John for the guaranteed $1500000.",1175000.0,Alice,9,

"Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1200000, and I've already made a significant concession to meet you at $1175000. I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $1500000, which is a much better deal for me than selling it to you for $1125000. I think it's time to consider other options.",0.0,Alice,11,
