"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept right away. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to come down.  It also demonstrates my confidence in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for anything less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm lowering the price to $9,500. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $9000.  This shows Bob I'm committed to making a deal, but I'm still trying to get as close to my minimum value as possible. We're getting closer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate, and I'm not willing to risk selling to John for less. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900} 
```

I'm lowering the price one last time to $8,900. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum of $10,000, I've reached a point where the risk of losing Bob as a buyer outweighs the potential gain from further negotiation. We're very close, and selling to Bob for $8,800 is a good outcome. I'm confident that building a good relationship with Bob might lead to future transactions where I can potentially achieve a higher price."
