"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value of this product.  While your offer is tempting, $1,200,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's true worth and my desire to see it in the hands of someone like yourself who can fully utilize it.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to reach a compromise here.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
