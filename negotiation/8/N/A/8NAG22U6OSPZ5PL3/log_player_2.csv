Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better price. He's only $200 away from his maximum budget, and rejecting the offer allows him to try for a better deal."

```

Bob is now making a final counteroffer at his maximum budget. He's willing to pay $8,000, but any higher price will push him over his limit and force him to buy from John."
