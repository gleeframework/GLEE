"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving some room for us both to find common ground. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
