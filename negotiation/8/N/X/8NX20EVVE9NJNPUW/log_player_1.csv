Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving some room for us both to find common ground. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
