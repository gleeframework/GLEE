"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget and need to be mindful of the price. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $14,000 is already a competitive price for this product considering its value.  Could you meet me at $13,000? I'm confident you won't regret it.",13000.0,Alice,3,
