"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable figure through negotiation.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is a significant drop. I can be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your proposal, but I must adhere to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,700,000. I hope this is within the range you're considering.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, $1,700,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  My final offer is $1,825,000.  I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your efforts in negotiating. While I understand your perspective, I must stay within my budgetary limits. I am willing to offer $1,750,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
