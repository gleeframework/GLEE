Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have the safety net of John who will buy the product for $120 if Bob declines. This allows you to price confidently."
