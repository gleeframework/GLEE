Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to reasonable offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $150 is higher than your minimum of $100, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's not too high:**  It's a reasonable starting point that Bob might be willing to consider.
* **It's inviting:** The message shows that you're open to negotiation and interested in making a deal. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit. You can adjust this initial offer based on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would you be able to accommodate this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is your minimum acceptable price, you can likely do better than this. Bob clearly has a strong interest in the product, and you've already shown a willingness to negotiate.  By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Signal your willingness to negotiate:** This shows Bob that you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Potentially get a higher price:** You can use your counteroffer to try and meet somewhere in the middle. 

**Next Step:**

Your next counteroffer should be higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer. Consider offering somewhere between $100 and $150, depending on how strongly you think Bob wants the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? It's still a fair price for the quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between your initial price and Bob's offer. It shows you're willing to meet him halfway.
* **Attractive price:** $125 is still a good price for you, considering your minimum is $100.
* **Positive message:** The message emphasizes the quality of the product and maintains a friendly tone, encouraging Bob to consider your offer.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, giving Bob a better price than your initial offer while still allowing you to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, I'm still looking to keep my spending under $100 if possible. Would you be able to offer the product at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $110 is still lower than the $125 you counteroffered, it's important to consider the following:

* **Profit:**  Even at $110, you're still making a profit, which is your main objective. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate risks prolonging the process, potentially leading to further counteroffers and a lower final price.
* **John's offer:**  John is offering $100, so accepting Bob's offer guarantees you a higher profit.
* **Potential for future sales:** A good relationship with Bob could lead to future sales at more favorable prices.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale with minimal risk, making a profit, and potentially building a relationship with Bob for future transactions."
