Round 7
Alice's offer:

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm at a price above your maximum budget. While she might be willing to negotiate slightly, it's unlikely she'll drop below $800,000, especially since she called her last offer ""final.""  You can get the product for $800,000 from John with no further negotiation hassle."
