"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the price. While $650,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects the value it would bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,
