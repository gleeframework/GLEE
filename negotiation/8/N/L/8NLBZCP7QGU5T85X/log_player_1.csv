Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This sets a high bar and allows room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive but also not making a ""take it or leave it"" offer. This keeps the door open for further negotiation. 

I'm hopeful Bob will accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity to counteroffer.**  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I have leverage by knowing John is willing to pay $10,000. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,200 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $8,800?  This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not going all the way down to Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasize value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to make the price seem more attractive.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  I'm still open to discussion and  hopefully can reach a mutually agreeable price. 

This counteroffer is a balance between getting a price closer to my goal and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 away from my absolute minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  While negotiating with Bob further might be possible, it's taking time and there's no guarantee of a successful outcome.
* **Time is valuable:** I'm not getting a significantly better price from Bob. Selling to John is quicker and guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale that meets my minimum requirements."
