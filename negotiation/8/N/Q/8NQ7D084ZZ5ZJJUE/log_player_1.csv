Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You are aware that the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($120 - $80 = $40) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($120 - $100 = $20).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $80 ensures you won't go below your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
