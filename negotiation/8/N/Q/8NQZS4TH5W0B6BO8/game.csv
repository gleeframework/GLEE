"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value you mentioned earlier.",16000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can offer you a compromise at $14,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you're getting.",14000.0,Alice,5,,
