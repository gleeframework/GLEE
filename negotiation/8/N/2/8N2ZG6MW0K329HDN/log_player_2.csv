"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice's offer is exactly at that price.  While accepting the offer would allow you to buy the product, it wouldn't save you any money. Since you can buy the product from John for the same price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John. This way, you have the option to potentially find a better deal later on."
