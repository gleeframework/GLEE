I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation but still reflects the product's value to me.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to him rather than John, his offer is well below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a fair compromise, given Bob's low initial offer and my willingness to sell to John for the same amount. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and better than selling to John for $12,000. I'll accept his offer."
