**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently pushing the price down and demanding additional value without significantly increasing his offer. At this point, it's unlikely he'll agree to a price that's significantly higher than his current offer of $1,225,000.  

It's time to cut our losses. Accepting John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees a sale at our minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which may not yield a significantly better outcome."
