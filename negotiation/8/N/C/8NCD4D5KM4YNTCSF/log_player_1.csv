"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives us room to negotiate.  I'm confident John's offer of $1,500,000 will be a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'm not yet ready to accept, and I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This is also the price that John is willing to pay, so I'm not taking any risk by making this offer.  I believe Bob will recognize that this is a fair price, and I hope he accepts it."
