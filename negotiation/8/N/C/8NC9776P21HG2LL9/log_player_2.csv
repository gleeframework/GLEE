"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  $9,000 is over your budget, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant discount to show Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal.  Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but it's still too high.  I'll counter again and try to get closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay John's price, but I'd prefer to do business with Alice if possible.  Let's see if she'll meet me halfway."
