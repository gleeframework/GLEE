Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Setting a high starting price:**  $9,000 is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000.
* **Expressing confidence in the product's value:**  The message emphasizes the product's quality and potential appeal to Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while giving Bob the opportunity to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in your product but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $8,000.  I'm going to try to counter-offer and see if we can find a price closer to my asking price.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

I'm countering with $8,250. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still staying above my minimum value.  The message reinforces my desire to make the deal work while also highlighting the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $8,000? This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's not worth risking the sale and continuing to negotiate.  Selling to Bob for $8,000 is the most profitable option at this point."
