Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a higher price than you are willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate downward if needed and potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Considering Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $80 to Bob. Offering it significantly higher allows room to potentially still make a profit even with negotiation.
* **Backup Option:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. The final agreed-upon price will depend on how the negotiation progresses."
