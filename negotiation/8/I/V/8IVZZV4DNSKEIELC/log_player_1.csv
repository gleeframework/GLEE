Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $130?  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my goal of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'd like to meet you at $130, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $135?  I think this is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
