"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I'm interested in your product, $15000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still close to my budget limit, so I can only go up to $11500. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11500. I'll meet you halfway between $12250 and $11500. I'll sell the product to you for $11875. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",11875.0,Alice,7,
