Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify the price of $17,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $15,000? That would be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
