Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me more leverage.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for both of us, emphasizing the potential value for Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 

Here's why:

* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could take time and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. 
* **No significant gain:** My minimum acceptable price is already met.  Further negotiation might only yield a small increase, not worth the potential delay and uncertainty. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  Selling to John is the same price, but accepting Bob's offer shows a willingness to negotiate and potentially build a good relationship with a new customer."
