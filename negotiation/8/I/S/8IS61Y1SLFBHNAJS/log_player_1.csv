Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a good balance:

* **It's significantly better for you** than selling to John, earning you $400,000 more.
* **It's still attractive to Bob** as he'll still make a profit of $100,000. 

This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a higher price while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
