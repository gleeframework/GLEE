"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,200,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to you and my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
