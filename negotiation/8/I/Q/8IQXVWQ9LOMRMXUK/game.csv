,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $175 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $150? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
