"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you might be interested in. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $150, and John is offering the product for exactly that amount, it's the most logical choice. There's no point in negotiating with Alice as you might end up paying more or going through multiple rounds of negotiation."
