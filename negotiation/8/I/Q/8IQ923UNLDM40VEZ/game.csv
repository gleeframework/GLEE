"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the market value.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below its true value and what I need to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which reflects a reasonable compromise. This price still allows me to meet my needs while giving you a fair deal. Let's work together to find a solution.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to offer $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $900000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. This price acknowledges your budget while ensuring I can still achieve my goals.  It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
