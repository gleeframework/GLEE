"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $100 right now.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $100 is definitely too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I believe that's a fair price considering the value of this product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $175 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $150. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.",150.0,Bob,4,
