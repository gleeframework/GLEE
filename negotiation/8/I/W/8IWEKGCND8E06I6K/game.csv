"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a good product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000?  That's a fair price that works for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise further and sell it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",8200.0,Alice,5,
