Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me is $800,000, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.

I'm going to sell to John. While I'm disappointed I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, it's clear we're not going to agree on a price that meets my minimum requirement.  John is offering me my desired price, and it's better to secure the sale than continue to negotiate with Bob."
