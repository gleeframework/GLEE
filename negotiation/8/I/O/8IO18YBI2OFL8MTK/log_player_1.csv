Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise considering the limited rounds remaining.  There's a risk of getting a lower offer in the next round or having to sell to John for a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable profit and avoids potential losses."
