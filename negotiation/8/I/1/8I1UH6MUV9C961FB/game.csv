"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out. However, $200 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget is around $100, but that's quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you possibly do $170? That's a significant discount from my original price.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $170 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to go to $120. That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  That's my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
