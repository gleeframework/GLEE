Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above your minimum acceptable value, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also highlights the potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? That's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $105 is still slightly below the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's initial value, it's a reasonable compromise. Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but the risk of losing the deal entirely increases.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a decent profit."
