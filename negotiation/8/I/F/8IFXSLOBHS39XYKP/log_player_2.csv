"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  There's room to go down before reaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $100 (Alice's value), we establish an ambitious but not unreasonable starting point.  There's a chance Alice might accept immediately.
* **Polite and Open:** We want to keep the negotiation amicable.  Expressing interest while also being clear about our budget keeps the door open for further discussion. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  Even if Alice rejects $100, we have room to go up before hitting our $150 limit with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but we still have room to work with before considering John's offer. Let's try to nudge the price down a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle on $115? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** We're moving closer to the middle ground. Alice's last offer was $130, ours was $100. $115 is closer to our desired price but shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Sense of Urgency (Slightly):**  By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" we subtly signal that we're getting closer to a point where we might have to consider other options (like John).
* **Maintaining Politeness:** We want to keep the tone positive to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. How about we try $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While we could try to negotiate further, $125 is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's $150.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Alice might go down a bit more if we counter, but it's also possible she might hold firm or even walk away. At this point, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of losing the deal."
