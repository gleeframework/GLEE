Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Gauging Interest:** A high initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you know he's very price-sensitive. If he counters, you can negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This knowledge gives you leverage.  If Bob isn't willing to meet a price that's significantly beneficial to you, you can confidently walk away. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, being flexible during negotiations is key. If Bob seems hesitant at $19,000, consider a smaller counter-offer to secure the deal, especially if you value a quick sale."
