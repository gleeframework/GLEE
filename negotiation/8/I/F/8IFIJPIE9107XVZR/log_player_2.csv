Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer the product to you for $105.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that beats John's offer of $100. It's better to cut your losses and secure the product at the best known price."
