"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting price is $1,750,000. This reflects the significant value and potential this product holds. I'm open to negotiation, so let's discuss!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you outlining the value you see in this product. However, $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,250,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to reflect your interest and the value of the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's reach a deal that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, recognizing the value you see in this product.  This is a substantial compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's seal the deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,425,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can reach an agreement at this price.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close.  Your offer of $1,425,000 is a good step in the right direction.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $1,440,000.  This is a small difference, and I'm confident this price is fair given the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",1440000.0,Alice,7,
