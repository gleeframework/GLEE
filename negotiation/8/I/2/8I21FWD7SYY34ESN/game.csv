"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and leaves room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and leaves some room for us to reach a deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to consider a further compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering you the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
