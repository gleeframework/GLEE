Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point.  It's a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still aiming to keep my spending within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on $90, and while it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'd rather sell to John and guarantee the price I want."
