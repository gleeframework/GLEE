"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to find common ground. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
