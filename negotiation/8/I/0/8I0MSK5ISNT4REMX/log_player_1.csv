Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial high offer gauges Bob's interest and potential for a higher profit margin. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price higher than your minimum.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning other potential buyers, you create a sense of urgency for Bob to decide.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, there's a good chance he'll counter with a price higher than $800,000, giving you further room to negotiate and maximize your profit."
