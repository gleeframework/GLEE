"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,250,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
