"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $795,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale here.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $772,500?",772500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to split the difference quite that much. I'm still at $795,000, and I'm not budging from that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a complimentary service package worth $12,500. This way, you'll get a great deal on the product and some extra value on top. The price remains at $795,000.",795000.0,Alice,7,
