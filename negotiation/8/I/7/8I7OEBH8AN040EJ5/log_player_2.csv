Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to split the difference quite that much. I'm still at $795,000, and I'm not budging from that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a complimentary service package worth $12,500. This way, you'll get a great deal on the product and some extra value on top. The price remains at $795,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While the extras might not be worth that much to me, Alice seems firm on her price. Accepting at $795,000 gets me the product for a decent amount less than John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
