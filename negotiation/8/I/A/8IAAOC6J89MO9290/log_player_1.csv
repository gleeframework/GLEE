Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $950,000. This is a unique product with immense value that you won't find elsewhere. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **High Starting Point:**  $950,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the product's uniqueness and value aims to justify the high price to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This assumes no negative consequences for offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. In real-world negotiations, understanding the buyer's perception and potential reactions is crucial."
