Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me leverage and also allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Positive framing:**  The message focuses on the value of the product for Bob, creating a positive association and encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I explicitly mention that I'm open to negotiation, showing flexibility and signaling that we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting it would mean losing a substantial amount of money. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price and potentially secure a higher sale.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  Even if negotiations with Bob fail, I have the guaranteed option of selling to John for $10,000, which is a safer alternative to accepting Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.  $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** My counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it's still a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. This demonstrates flexibility and good faith while still protecting my interests. 
* **Appeal to compromise:** The message emphasizes the shared goal of finding a mutually agreeable price, encouraging Bob to consider meeting halfway.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  The tone remains friendly and positive, creating a more conducive environment for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I'm comfortable with, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is just $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I would be left with the less favorable option of selling to John for $10,000.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, especially if Bob becomes more resistant.  It's likely that I won't get a significantly better offer from him.

Considering the potential risks of further negotiation and the relatively small difference between Bob's offer and my minimum, it's more advantageous to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
