{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's well below what it's worth to me, and still a significant savings for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.**
* **It's attractive to Bob, offering him a substantial discount.**
* **It allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, giving us room to find a mutually beneficial price.**

I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option, ensuring I can always secure my minimum price if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I understand he's trying to negotiate, accepting this offer would mean a major financial loss for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. While your offer is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $850,000? This price still represents a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  $850,000 is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Still a good deal for Bob:**  $850,000 is still a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and is a good value for Bob considering the product's worth to him.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the deal for both parties. This helps maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere.

I believe this counteroffer provides a good balance between my needs and Bob's, and positions me to potentially close the deal without needing to go to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to significantly sacrifice my profit margin at this point.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer of $850,000, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us without going too far below my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob is unwilling to budge, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's find a compromise. How about $840,000? It's a small step up from your offer, and it brings us closer to an agreement.  This is a very valuable product, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment."", ""product_price"": 840000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:** My counteroffer of $840,000 is only $15,000 higher than Bob's offer. This demonstrates my flexibility and willingness to find a compromise. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I remind Bob of the product's value and how this investment will benefit him in the long run.
* **Positive tone:**  My message remains friendly and encourages a continued discussion.

By offering a small increase, I hope to show Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. If he's truly determined to stay at $825,000, I might need to consider selling to John.  However, I'm optimistic that we can find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $820,000, and that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $820,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's clear that we are not going to reach a mutually agreeable price with further negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I would have preferred to sell to Bob,  this ensures I meet my minimum price and avoid a substantial financial loss."
