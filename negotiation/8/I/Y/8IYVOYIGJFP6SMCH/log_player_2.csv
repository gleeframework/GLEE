"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, $14,000 is still too high. We need to show her we're willing to walk away to get a better deal. Let's see if she'll budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I could potentially go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $13,500. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision point. Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but it's still a significant difference from John's offer. By rejecting again, we risk Alice walking away, forcing us to buy from John at our maximum price. However, there's still a chance to get a better deal from Alice. We need to show we're serious about our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to make a fair profit, but I have a strict budget. $12,500 is the absolute most I can justify spending on this.  If you're not willing to go that low, I completely understand, but I may have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  This message reaffirms our budget limit while acknowledging Alice's position. 
* **Slight increase:** Moving up to $12,500 shows willingness to compromise, but only slightly.
* **Introducing consequence:** By mentioning ""other options,"" we signal that we're seriously considering John's offer if Alice doesn't budge. 

This approach walks a fine line between pushing for a better deal and risking losing the negotiation altogether. It depends on Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to make this work, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses and buy from John. 

Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge further:** She's now mirroring our language about ""other options,"" suggesting she's reached her limit.
* **The savings are significant:** Buying from John saves us $3,000 compared to Alice's latest offer. 
* **Time is a factor:** We've already used 7 of our 10 rounds. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her offer going no lower, forcing us to buy from John at the last minute anyway.

While we might have gotten Alice down a little bit more, it's unlikely to be worth the additional time and the risk of losing the $10,000 backup option."
