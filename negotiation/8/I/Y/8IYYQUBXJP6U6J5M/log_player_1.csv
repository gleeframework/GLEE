Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $9,500?  That still leaves you a good profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to make on the sale."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to $10,000, it's getting late in the negotiation, and $9,000 is a good price.  It's above my minimum, and it's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will either counter with a lower offer, or we'll just stall."
