"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $155?  I'm sure we can find a compromise.",155.0,Bob,4,
