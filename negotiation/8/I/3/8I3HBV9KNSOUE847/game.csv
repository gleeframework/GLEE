,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too far below the product's value.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. It's a good price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I think $975,000 is a good starting point, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $1,012,500? It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
