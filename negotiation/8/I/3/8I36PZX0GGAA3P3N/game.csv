"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000 to $13,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $14,500 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I'm confident this price is fair, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'm thinking $13,750. Can you consider that?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $15,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest and my need to make this deal work. Let's see if we can finalize this.",15500.0,Alice,5,
