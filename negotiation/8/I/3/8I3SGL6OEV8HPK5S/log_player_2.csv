"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $110.  This means you can potentially save $10.  It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price ($120). Even though it's closer, it's worth trying to negotiate further. There's still room for a lower price, and you can save more by rejecting and continuing the negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $112. This is only $2 more than your last counteroffer of $110, and it's still within your budget of $120.  While you could continue negotiating, the potential savings are now very small. It's likely that Alice is firm on her price, and continuing the negotiation might only lead to a longer process with little payoff. Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product quickly without much risk."
