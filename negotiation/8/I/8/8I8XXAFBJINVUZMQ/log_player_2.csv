{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $9,000 when I can get it from John for $8,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'll start by offering Alice $7,500. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and hopefully, it'll be a good starting point for our negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my desired price, John's offer is still more attractive. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not as good as John's offer. I'll reject it and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7900}
```

I'll increase my offer to $7,900. This is a small increase from my previous offer, and I hope it will be enough to convince Alice to sell.  If she rejects again, I might consider buying from John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than what I can get from John. I'll reject this offer and see if I can convince Alice to go lower in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going to go all-in and offer Alice $8,000, which is the price John is offering.  This is my final offer.  I'm hoping Alice will accept to close the deal. If she doesn't, I'll buy from John."
