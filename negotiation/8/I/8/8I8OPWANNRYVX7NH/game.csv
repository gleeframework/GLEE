"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,150,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit too high. I'm happy to go to $1,100,000. Let's close this deal, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I can do $1,120,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from your side.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll increase my offer to $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's seal this deal!",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my next move. Let me see... I can do $1,095,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet at a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1095000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,095,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",1075000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to make one last push, but I need to see some movement from your side. I can do $1,090,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Let's see if we can make this work.",1090000.0,Alice,9,
