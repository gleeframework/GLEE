"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm looking for at least $140 to make it worth my while.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit too high for me. How about $125? I think that's fair considering your desired price.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $132 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",132.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $132 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's split the difference and see if we can close this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $135, which is the highest I can go. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
