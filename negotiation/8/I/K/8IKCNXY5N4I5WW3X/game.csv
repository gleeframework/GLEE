"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'll love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $80 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? This is still a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 just isn't working for me. Let's split the difference - $110. It's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.",110.0,Alice,5,
