"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'll love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me ($150) and leaving some room for negotiation. I also want to sound friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $80 as it's worth at least $150 to me. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $80 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? This is still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to try to squeeze out a bit more from Bob.  I want to keep the negotiation going and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 just isn't working for me. Let's split the difference - $110. It's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 110}
