"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This shows a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that reflects the value of this product.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is coming down in price, the difference between her offer and John's guaranteed price is getting smaller. It's becoming riskier to continue negotiating with Alice when I can get the product for a sure $1,000,000 from John."
