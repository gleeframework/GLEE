"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $600,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure the product for a price closer to $500,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $550,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $550,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get the product for $525,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",525000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $525,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $575,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable middle ground.",575000.0,Alice,5,
