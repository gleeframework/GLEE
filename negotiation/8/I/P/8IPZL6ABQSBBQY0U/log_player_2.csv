Round 5
Alice's offer:

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Reason:  Alice is holding firm at $8,000, and this offer is a reasonable compromise. Accepting now ensures I get the product for a good price and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing. It's better to save $1,800 than to risk getting stuck with John's $10,000 price."
