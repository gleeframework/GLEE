"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with my ideal price.  Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, I'm going to see if Bob is willing to pay that. It's possible he'll be surprised by the high price, but it's a good starting point. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for this price, which gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I won't accept it, and will proceed with a counteroffer in the next round. While selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, I still have time to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on my value for the product.  I believe this price is a good compromise that might be appealing to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's a slight improvement. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating.  I'm aware that selling to John is always an option, but I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product to me. I'm hoping that this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects it again, I'm seriously considering selling to John, as we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still far from my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating. While John is always an option, I'm still hopeful that I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still holding firm. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping Bob will finally see that it's in his best interest to accept. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is too high. I've made numerous concessions, but he's still not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get my desired profit and avoids the risk of Bob continuing to counteroffer and potentially driving the price down further."
