"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that my product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
