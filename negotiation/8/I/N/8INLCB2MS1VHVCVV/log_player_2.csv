"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on something valuable at a good price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I will reject the offer. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so I'm sure I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'll reject Alice's offer and look for a better price.
