Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on something valuable at a good price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,500 offer:** This price is a good starting point. It's above your minimum threshold of $10,000 but also leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  The message highlights the product's value to both you and Bob, making the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Why this strategy is good:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:** A $12,500 sale would be a good outcome for you, exceeding your minimum.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Bob might be willing to pay closer to his perceived value of $15,000, giving you the chance for an even better deal.
* **Minimizes risk:**  If Bob rejects, you have a guaranteed backup sale with John at your minimum price."
