"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $130. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but I'm still a little too high.  I'm happy to pay $140.  This is a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that $145 is a fair price for both of us.  This is a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",145.0,Bob,6,

If you're still interested, I'd be happy to sell it to you at this price. However, if not, I'll have to consider other options.",150.0,Alice,7,
