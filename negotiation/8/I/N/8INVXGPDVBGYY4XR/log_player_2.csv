# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a no-brainer. Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly less than your $1,200,000 budget and the $1,200,000 John is offering.  Saving $250,000 is a great deal!"
