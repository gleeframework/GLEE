"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I believe it's a steal for what it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's important to signal that you're looking for a much lower price.  We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way outside my budget.  I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for a product like this. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $18,000 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $18,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $12,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate your position, but $12,000 is still a significant way off from what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $16,000. This offer stands as a firm reflection of the product's value.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving slowly.  While $16,000 is better, we're still aiming for a much lower price. We'll need to be a bit more firm in the next round to try and move things along."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.  I can go up to $13,000, but that's really my limit. Let me know if that's doable."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
