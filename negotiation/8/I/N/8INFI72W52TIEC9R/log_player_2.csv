"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth to you and its market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is asking for $12,000. There's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. I am willing to sell the product for $9,500. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to achieve a satisfactory return on my investment.

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget.  It's a better deal than Alice's initial offer, but John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000.  Bob should stick with John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
