I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate.  It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, who will pay my minimum price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,550,000, which is still above my minimum but shows willingness to negotiate. This might entice Bob to accept, considering he's already increased his offer once."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now offering a price that is significantly below my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's still a better deal than accepting Bob's current offer."
