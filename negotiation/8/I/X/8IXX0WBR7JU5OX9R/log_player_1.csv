"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product like this, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'll counteroffer again, but if we don't reach a more acceptable price soon, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal, I'm ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we've already had several rounds of negotiation. To avoid further delays and ensure I get a good price, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."
