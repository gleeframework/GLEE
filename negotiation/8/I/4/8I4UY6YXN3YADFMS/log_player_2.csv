Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $85? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it that low. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price. How about we meet at $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $82 gets us the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
