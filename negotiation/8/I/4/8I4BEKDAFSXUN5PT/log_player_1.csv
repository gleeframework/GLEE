Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to propose a price of $1,350,000. I believe this price is fair, reflecting both the product's worth and the potential benefits it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.
