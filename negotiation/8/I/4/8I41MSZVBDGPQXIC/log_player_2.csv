{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $80 is still a good price for me, and it leaves room for us to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm raising my offer a bit, but I'm still below Alice's price. Hopefully, this shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want a fair deal."
