Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's important to start with a price that's higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This gives you room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **High-value language:**  Using phrases like ""fantastic product"" and ""great fit"" subtly suggests the value to Bob without revealing your own cost.
* **Open-ended question:** The ""Let me know what you think"" encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

**Note:** This is just a starting point. The actual offer you make will depend on factors like your knowledge of the market, your relationship with Bob, and your risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:**  While $12,000 is your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to negotiate a bit higher.
* **Room for compromise:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if you show some willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential for a better price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can attempt to get closer to your desired price.

**Next steps:**  In the next round, you'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider these options:

* **Counter with a slightly higher price:**  You could offer $13,000, for example.
* **Counter with a middle ground:** Offer $12,500 to find a compromise.
* **Use a ""reasoned"" approach:**  Explain why your product is worth more than $12,000, such as its unique features or high quality."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're interested in the product.  While $12,000 is my minimum,  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this deal happen. This price reflects the value I know you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** By offering a counteroffer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate.
* **Moderate compromise:**  The $13,000 price is a reasonable compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasize value:**  The message reinforces the potential value Bob will receive from the product.

**Next steps:**

* **Be prepared to negotiate further:** If Bob rejects this offer, you'll need to consider making another counteroffer or potentially selling to John.
* **Watch for signs:** Pay attention to Bob's language and tone in his responses. This can provide clues about his willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of $12500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between your last offer ($13,000) and his previous offer ($12,000).
* **Close to your minimum:**  While not your ideal price, $12,500 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that he'll walk away, leaving you with no sale.

**Conclusion:** 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is close to your minimum and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
