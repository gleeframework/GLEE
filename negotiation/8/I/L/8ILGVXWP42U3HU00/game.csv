"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we settle on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
