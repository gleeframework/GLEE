This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  You're running out of rounds, and Alice knows it. She's likely to be less flexible as you get closer to the deadline.
* **Reasonable Price:**  $1,200,000 is a decent compromise.  You're saving $200,000 compared to her initial offer and only paying $200,000 more than your absolute limit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If you push further and Alice doesn't budge, you might end up having to buy from John for $1,000,000, saving only $50,000 more. This deal offers a good balance of risk and reward."
