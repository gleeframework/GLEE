"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $7,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,750 is still too low. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,125?  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",8125.0,Alice,5,
