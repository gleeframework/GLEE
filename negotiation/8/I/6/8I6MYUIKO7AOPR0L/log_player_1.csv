"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and sets a strong starting point.
* **Reasonable Margin:** The price is still below my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000), leaving me room to potentially go lower if needed.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, showing Bob that I'm willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** We have 8 rounds remaining, which gives me ample time to try and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Potential to increase the price:**  Bob's counteroffer indicates he is willing to pay more than his initial stated value of $1,000,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but $1525000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1425000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're in round 8, and with only two rounds left, the pressure is mounting.
* **Risk of Going Too Low:**  While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,425,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. There's a risk that we might not reach a deal at a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Guaranteed Value:** John is offering me my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  This is a guaranteed sale that ensures I don't lose money.

Considering the limited rounds remaining and the potential for a stalemate, it's in my best interest to take the guaranteed offer from John and sell the product for $1,500,000.  This allows me to secure a deal that meets my minimum financial requirements."
