Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure the Higher Sale:**  Even if Bob negotiates the price down slightly, Alice is still likely to get a better price than the $10,000 John is offering.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines."
