{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. If Bob rejects it, I can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $108. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk going lower than my minimum. John is a guaranteed $120, so I'll sell to him instead."
