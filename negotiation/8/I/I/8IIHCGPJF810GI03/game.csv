"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still significantly below what I need to sell this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1100000 to make this worthwhile.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1075000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1075000 is closer, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1060000 for your product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
