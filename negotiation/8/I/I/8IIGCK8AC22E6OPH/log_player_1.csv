Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

While Bob's offer is better than his first, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not desperate and have a backup buyer in John, so I'm going to try and negotiate a better price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,200, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9200}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not feeling pressured to accept yet. I'm still holding out for a price closer to $9,000 and have John as a backup buyer. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before accepting his offer."

Round 7

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I'll make one more offer. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and have a backup buyer in John who will pay my minimum price. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point. I'm going to sell the product to John."
