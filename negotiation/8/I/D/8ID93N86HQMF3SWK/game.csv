"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and your budget. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet even $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000 for your product. I hope this revised proposal is within your acceptable range.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
