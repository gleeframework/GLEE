"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'd be satisfied with the product at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
