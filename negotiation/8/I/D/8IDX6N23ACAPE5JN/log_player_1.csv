I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a bit higher than my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $175. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, hopefully leading to a quick agreement."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly higher than John's offer, it's still a better deal for me, and I'm not sure if I'd be able to get a higher price in subsequent rounds."
