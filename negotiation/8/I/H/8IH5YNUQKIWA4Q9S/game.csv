"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to find a good deal.  While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, the true value of this product is far greater, especially to someone like you who can maximize its potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, at $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
