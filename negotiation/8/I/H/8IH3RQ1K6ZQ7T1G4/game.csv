,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $125?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than that.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
