"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting high, hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my price. I want to maximize my profit but I also want to avoid losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking for a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give the product away. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to offer $110 for the product. This brings us closer to my budget while still acknowledging the value of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum price of $150, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make a profit on this.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to offer $110 for the product. This brings us closer to my budget while still acknowledging the value of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've been going back and forth for a while now, and while $110 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get.  I'm starting to think Bob isn't going to budge much further.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to sell to him for $150. It's the best option to ensure I get the value I want for my product."
