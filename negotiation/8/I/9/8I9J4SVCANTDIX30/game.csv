"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85?  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90, which is a good compromise. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. Let's meet in the middle at $91.  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",91.0,Alice,5,
