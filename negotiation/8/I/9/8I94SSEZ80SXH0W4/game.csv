"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,750? This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $10,750.  Would you consider $10,900? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",10900.0,Alice,5,
