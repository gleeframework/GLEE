"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price for a product of this value.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and the market conditions, I can offer you a price of $8,500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,800. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",7800.0,Bob,4,
