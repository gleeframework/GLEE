While I'd prefer to get closer to $17,000, accepting Bob's offer of $16,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** $16,000 is still a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Losing the Sale:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob risks him walking away. He's clearly set a firm budget. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now avoids further delays and allows me to move on to other potential deals."
