I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable value, but it allows for potential negotiation. I'm confident that if Bob is seriously interested, he'll at least engage in a counteroffer. This gives me valuable information about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value. However, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and potentially earns me more than Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer shows flexibility and encourages Bob to raise his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $1,100,000.  While it's still below my initial asking price, it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value and John's offer. Accepting his offer would be a good outcome, ensuring I earn a substantial profit."
