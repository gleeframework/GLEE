{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low offer, significantly below Alice's asking price but still within my budget. This will signal my seriousness in negotiating and hopefully encourage Alice to come down in price."
