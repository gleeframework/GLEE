,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's considerably higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product, which is still a fair price given its value.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but I need to see a more serious commitment from your side. Would you consider $1,400,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for this product, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and a substantial amount for the product. I believe this shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about reaching a deal, and I appreciate that. However, the value of this product is firmly above $900,000. I'm willing to consider $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to find a solution. What are your thoughts on this?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value of this product, $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a substantial increase from my last offer, demonstrating my sincere desire to reach a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increasingly strong offers.  To demonstrate my own commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
