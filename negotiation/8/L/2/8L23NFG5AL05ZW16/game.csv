"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $750000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $850000. I'm willing to go up to $825000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $825000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $875000. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, which is my previous highest offer. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I hope we can agree on this price.",825000.0,Bob,6,
