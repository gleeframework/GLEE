"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is still a bit below my target, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a sweet spot for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
