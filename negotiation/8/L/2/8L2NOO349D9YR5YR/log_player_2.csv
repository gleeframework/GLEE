"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is still a bit below my target, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a sweet spot for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to sell. It's better to secure the product at a price that's within his range, especially since he only has 10 rounds to close the deal."
