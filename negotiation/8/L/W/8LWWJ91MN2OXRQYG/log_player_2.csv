"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $120. It's far too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I think the product is worth more than $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price. While $80 from John is attractive, there's still room to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $95.  This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to an agreement. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $99, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is $99. While it's getting closer to Bob's target price of $80, it's still too high. Bob has already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go much lower. It's time to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $80."
