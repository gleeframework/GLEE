"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above your desired price point of $10,000. You can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate. It's also still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her minimum price of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe the product's value to you would be worth the extra $1,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your desired price point, but closer to your original counteroffer. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is a fair price considering it's well above your value of $10,000 and I'm still willing to buy from you rather than John."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price closer to Alice's latest offer while still remaining within your budget. It also emphasizes the benefit for Alice in closing the deal with you rather than risking you going to John."
