Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

$200 is way too high for you.  You'll counteroffer Alice and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

You offer Alice your maximum price for the product, $80.  This is what you're willing to pay, and you hope Alice is willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you'd prefer to pay $80, Alice's offer of $85 is still within your budget and a good deal compared to the $150 it's worth to her. You're willing to accept this offer to avoid risking further negotiation or losing out on the product altogether."
