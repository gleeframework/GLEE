Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategic because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so he might be willing to pay a little more, especially if he wants the product badly.
* **It's lower than your guaranteed value:**  You're guaranteed $15,000 from John, so you're still making a profit even if Bob rejects the offer. 

This gives Bob a potential bargain, while still giving you a good return on your product."
