"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is decent, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or still secure the product from John at your maximum budget."
