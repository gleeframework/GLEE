{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  He still gets a good deal, making him more likely to accept.
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate and potentially earn closer to your desired price. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, you can work with him to find a middle ground.

However, remember:  You can always choose to sell to John for $12,000 if you feel the negotiation isn't going well!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below your desired price. There's still room to negotiate, and you're confident you can get a better price. 

By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Show you're serious about getting a good price:** You're not willing to settle for the first offer.
* **Start a negotiation:**  You can now make a counteroffer and try to find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Keep the option of selling to John:** Remember, if things don't work out with Bob, you can still secure the $12,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my initial offer.  While $9,500 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. How about $9,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I would like to propose $9,600 for the product. This is my final offer, as it closely aligns with my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,600 is very close to your desired price. While it's still below your minimum of $12,000, it's a good deal considering:

* **It's close to your desired price:**  You're very close to reaching your goal. 
* **He's stated this is his final offer:**  There's a risk of losing the deal if you reject.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** You can still sell to John for $12,000 if you don't accept this offer, but that risks delaying your sale. 

It's a good strategy to accept this offer to secure a deal and avoid potentially losing out to a higher price."
