"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, my initial price takes into account the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but $600,000 is too low.  Could you consider a figure closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
