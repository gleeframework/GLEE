"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be very beneficial to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point and plays on the potential benefits the product could bring to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or secure the sale to John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to work with you. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target of $1,500,000. I believe I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I'm not willing to give up on the potential for a higher sale price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value and potential of this product. It's a win-win scenario where we both achieve a favorable outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,550,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,425,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to stay within my means. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need a more significant reduction in price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. With only 4 rounds remaining, the likelihood of Bob agreeing to my desired price is decreasing.  Therefore, the most prudent decision is to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I secure my minimum value.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, this choice guarantees my desired outcome."
