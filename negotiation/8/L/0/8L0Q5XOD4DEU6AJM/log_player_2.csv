It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can likely get the price down closer to your $10,000 limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

While $10,250 is closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice will be willing to lower the price a bit more to secure the sale."
