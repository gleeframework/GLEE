{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than my minimum, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,250 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is my absolute limit.  If you're able to meet me there, I'm ready to make the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I could sell to John for the same amount.  It's best to accept and finalize the deal."
