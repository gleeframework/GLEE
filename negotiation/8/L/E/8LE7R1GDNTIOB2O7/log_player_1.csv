Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in.  I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, giving me a chance to negotiate closer to my desired price. I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $100, so I can always walk away from the deal if Bob isn't willing to come up to a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm confident that I can get closer to that price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```
I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $92.50 is close to my minimum, I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the guaranteed $100 from John. I'll take the safe option and sell to John."
