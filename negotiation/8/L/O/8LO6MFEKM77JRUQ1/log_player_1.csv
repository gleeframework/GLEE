Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $950,000 is well above your $800,000 minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he has an incentive to accept a price lower than that.
* **It's a strong opening position:** This offer shows you're confident in the product's value and are willing to negotiate, but not desperate to sell. 

This strategy allows you to maximize your potential profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum of $800,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is simply too low. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price is still significantly below the product's value to you, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I've already made a concession, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a lower price. To avoid risking a lower price, I'll accept John's offer of $800,000, which is my minimum and ensures a profitable sale."
