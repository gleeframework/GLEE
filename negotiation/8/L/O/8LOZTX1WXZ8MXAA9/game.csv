"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After careful consideration of its value, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true potential and is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's work together to find a price that's agreeable for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,950,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While your offer is getting closer, we're still a significant way apart. I'm willing to accept $1,700,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
