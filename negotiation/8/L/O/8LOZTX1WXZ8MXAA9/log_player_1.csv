"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After careful consideration of its value, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true potential and is a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:** I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).  This gives me room to negotiate down while aiming for a much higher profit.
* **Justification for the price:** Highlighting the product's ""true potential"" aims to shift Bob's focus away from his initial valuation and towards the potential benefits he might be overlooking. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm framing this as a ""starting point,"" signaling my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's work together to find a price that's agreeable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below both my minimum and my desired outcome. While he's showing willingness to negotiate, accepting at this point would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially knowing I have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but strategic reduction:** I've made a substantial price reduction ($300,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. However, I am still far above both his offer and my absolute bottom line.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reiterating the product's high ""market value"" to steer Bob away from solely focusing on his own valuation.
* **Seeking a middle ground:**  My message emphasizes compromise and finding a ""solution,"" suggesting that I'm open to further negotiation if Bob moves closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,950,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is improving, it's still below my guaranteed sale price with John. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to push Bob closer to at least $1,400,000 before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While your offer is getting closer, we're still a significant way apart. I'm willing to accept $1,700,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer tactic:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to take this proposal seriously. 
* **Strategic positioning:** $1,700,000 is still a considerable profit above my guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value while acknowledging his willingness to negotiate, hoping to make the offer more appealing.

This approach aims to either secure a favorable deal with Bob or prompt him to significantly increase his offer. If he rejects this, I might consider accepting a slightly lower offer in the next round, knowing I'm running out of rounds and have John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price, which is also my guaranteed offer from John.  While I could try to push for a bit more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting now guarantees a favorable outcome."
