"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider  $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is still a fair compromise, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see we're getting close to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This price takes into account your previous offers and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I could meet you halfway at $1,025,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking that $1,050,000 was a fair compromise, and I'm not willing to go below that. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering it to you for $1,030,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
