Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $10,000, so I can offer it to you for $10,100. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $10,000. Accepting her offer of $10,100 secures a good price for you without risking the deal falling through entirely."
