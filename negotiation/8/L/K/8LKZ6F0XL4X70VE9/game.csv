"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That product looks great, but $11,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and quality.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While the product looks fantastic, I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding. I'm committed to buying this product, but $10,200 is just a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and do $10,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $10,000, so I can offer it to you for $10,100. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10100.0,Alice,7,
