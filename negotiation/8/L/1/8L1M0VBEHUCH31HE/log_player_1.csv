"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and optimistic message encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, making it more appealing.

**Note:** This is just the initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy and price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm a bit of a bargain hunter, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate. I believe I can still get a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  While selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob. 

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my initial ask of $9,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $7,000 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $8,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous ask ($9,000) and Bob's offer ($7,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize that $8,500 is a fair price for both of us. This makes the offer more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept the counteroffer.

**Note:** This counteroffer allows me to potentially secure a price close to my minimum acceptable price while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $7,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Accepting would be a loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. I believe I can still secure a higher price with further rounds.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** While selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, I'm not yet ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob.

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $7,500 is closer, but we're still a bit apart. How about we meet in the middle again? Let's settle on $8,000. That's my minimum, and it's a price I think we can both be happy with. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm again offering a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($8,500) and Bob's offer ($7,500).
* **Finality:** I emphasize that $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, implying that I'm not willing to go lower. This adds urgency.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and encouraging tone, making the offer more appealing.

**Note:** This counteroffer is my final attempt to secure a price close to my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell the product to John for $8,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $7,250 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum.  I'm starting to believe further negotiation won't get me a higher price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

At this point, I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob, and the risk of further negotiation isn't worth it.  Selling to John ensures a certain and acceptable outcome."
