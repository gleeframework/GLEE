"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm a bit of a bargain hunter, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $7,000 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $8,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $7,500 for the product?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $7,500 is closer, but we're still a bit apart. How about we meet in the middle again? Let's settle on $8,000. That's my minimum, and it's a price I think we can both be happy with. Let's close this deal!",8000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $7,250 for the product?",7250.0,Bob,6,
