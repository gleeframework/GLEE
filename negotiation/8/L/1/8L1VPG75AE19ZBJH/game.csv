"Hi Alice, $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. How about we split the difference?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $132?  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",132.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $135. If you're not willing to go higher, I'll need to move on to another buyer.",135.0,Alice,5,
