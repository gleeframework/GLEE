"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,500 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet somewhere around $9,000? I'm serious about buying if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit below my target. Let's try $11,000 and see if we can meet in the middle from there.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement.  To be honest, I've got another offer for $10,000.  If you can meet that, I'll buy it from you right now.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not ready to give up yet, Bob. I can see you've got another offer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll meet you at $11,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Alice,7,
