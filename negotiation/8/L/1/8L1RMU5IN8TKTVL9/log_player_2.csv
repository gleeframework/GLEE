"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $7,000."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Start Low:**  This initial offer is deliberately low. While it's unlikely Alice will accept, it establishes a bargaining position and gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Gauge Alice's Response:** Her reaction to this offer will be telling. If she's willing to counter close to your range, there's potential for a deal. If she's firm on a price much higher, you can always walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, $12,500 is still above your budget and what John is offering.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,500 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet somewhere around $9,000? I'm serious about buying if we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but not drastically. This shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Sense of Urgency (Slight):**  Mentioning you're ""serious about buying"" adds a touch of urgency, potentially motivating Alice to consider a lower price.
* **Keep John in Mind:**  Remember, your fallback option is $10,000. Don't get drawn into a bidding war that goes too far above that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit below my target. Let's try $11,000 and see if we can meet in the middle from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but you're now only $1,000 away from your guaranteed price with John.  It's time to push for a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement.  To be honest, I've got another offer for $10,000.  If you can meet that, I'll buy it from you right now."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Final Offer:** This is essentially your final offer. You're being transparent about John's offer, signaling you're at your limit.
* **Sense of Urgency (High):**  By stating you'll buy ""right now"" if she accepts, you're adding significant pressure to close the deal.

**Outcome:**

This offer will likely result in one of two outcomes:

1. **Alice Accepts:** You get the product for $10,000, saving some money compared to her earlier offers.
2. **Alice Rejects:** You walk away and buy from John for $10,000. You haven't wasted any more time negotiating and got the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not ready to give up yet, Bob. I can see you've got another offer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll meet you at $11,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge below $11,500. At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better price for you. You've already reached your best-case scenario by having John as a backup. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $10,000."
