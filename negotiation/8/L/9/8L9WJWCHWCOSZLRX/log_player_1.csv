Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 is slightly below my minimum but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a ""good deal"" and increases the likelihood of him accepting. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John at my desired minimum price."
