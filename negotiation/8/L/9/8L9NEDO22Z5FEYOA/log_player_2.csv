# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognize your interest. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To be fair to us both, I'm proposing $1,350,000.  This acknowledges your perspective while still reflecting the true value of what I'm offering.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but we're getting close to the point where this becomes unfeasible for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000, but this is my absolute limit.  I believe this is a very fair offer considering the value this product provides.
