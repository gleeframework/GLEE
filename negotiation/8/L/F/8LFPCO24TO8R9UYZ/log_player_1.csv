Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could lead to a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000  leaves room for negotiation but still positions it significantly above Bob's perceived value.  
* **Justification:** The message highlights the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the price and encourage Bob to consider the potential benefits beyond his initial valuation.
 
**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential reward of securing a higher price outweighs the guarantee of the lower offer in this scenario."
