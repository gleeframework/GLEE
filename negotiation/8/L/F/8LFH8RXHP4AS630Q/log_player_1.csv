Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob some room to bargain and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **John as a safety net:**  If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John, who will pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below my starting offer.  Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John is still an option:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $150, ensuring a profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you showing interest. I'm willing to go down to $110 for this product. That's still a great deal, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $130 to $110. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:**  $110 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm still making a profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm still leaving room for further negotiation, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer if he's still hesitant.
* **Maintaining a strong position:** I'm not willing to go much lower, so Bob knows I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $100 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  I've already made two counteroffers, and there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer further.  
* **Secure profit with John:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

Even though I could try to continue negotiating with Bob, the potential gains are not worth the risk of losing time and ultimately getting a lower price than I could get from John."
