Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent price.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, as he has a clear incentive to acquire the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not confident I can get him to increase his offer much further. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum, it's best to cut my losses and sell to John."
