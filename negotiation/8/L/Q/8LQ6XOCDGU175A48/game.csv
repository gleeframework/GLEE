"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $11,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer, and it gives us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I am still unable to meet you at $11,000. I would like to propose $10,500 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
