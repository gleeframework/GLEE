"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's work together to make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  While $9,750 is closer, it's still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference again - how about $10,125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can make this work. What do you say?",10125.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but I don't think I can go any higher. Can you meet me at this price?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,900 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $10,012? This is a small compromise for both of us, and we can finalize this deal within the remaining rounds. What do you think?",10012.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,8,
