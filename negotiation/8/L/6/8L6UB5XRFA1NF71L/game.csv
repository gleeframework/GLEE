"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this. However, $800,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $600,000. This price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to lower the price to $700,000. This is a more reasonable price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $650,000.  This price is closer to what I can reasonably pay, and still allows for a good profit for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to lower the price to $675,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $675,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to offer $660,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a fair deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",660000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $660,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to lower the price to $665,000. This is a final concession, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",665000.0,Alice,7,
