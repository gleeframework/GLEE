It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:**  You're getting the product for $915,000, a significant savings from both John's price ($1,200,000) and Alice's initial offer ($1,000,000).
* **Time Pressure:** You're in Round 7 with only 3 rounds left. Alice is clearly signaling that she won't go much lower. If you push too hard, you risk her walking away.
* **Unknown Outcome:**  Continuing to negotiate doesn't guarantee a better price. You might only get a small concession, or you could reach an impasse and have to settle for John's offer anyway.

This seems like a good point to accept the deal and secure your savings."
