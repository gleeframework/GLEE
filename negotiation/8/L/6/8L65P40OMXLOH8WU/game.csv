"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it will be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is excellent, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $8,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and what it can do for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $9,500? I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  Let's settle this right now - how about $12,000 even?  That's a significant price reduction and a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  $12,000 is still a touch more than I'd like to spend. I can do $10,500, and I think that's my final offer.  It's a win-win at that price.",10500.0,Bob,6,
