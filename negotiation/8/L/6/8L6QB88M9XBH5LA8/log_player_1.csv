Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my usual asking price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** My message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for Bob, encouraging him to consider the value proposition.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer allows for several rounds of counteroffers before I need to consider John's offer. 

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is far below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the gap. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and demonstrate that I'm not willing to accept a significantly discounted price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise by meeting him halfway. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  The message emphasizes that this offer is still beneficial for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  While I've lowered my price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and provides me with a substantial profit.

This counteroffer balances my desire for a higher price with the need to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to more rounds of counteroffers, potentially lowering the price further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me the maximum profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

Even though I'm not getting the ideal price, selling to John ensures I don't lose out on a significant amount of money and provides a more secure outcome."
