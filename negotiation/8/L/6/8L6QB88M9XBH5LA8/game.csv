"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
