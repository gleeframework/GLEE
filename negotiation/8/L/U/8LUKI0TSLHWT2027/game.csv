"Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $150. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $165. This is my final compromise, so I hope you'll consider it.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $165 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $140 for this product. This is the most I can afford, and I hope you'll consider it.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is your maximum budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I still need to make a profit, and $140 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $165, which would be $152.50. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",152.5,Alice,5,
