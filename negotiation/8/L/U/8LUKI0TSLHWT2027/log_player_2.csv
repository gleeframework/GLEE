"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out on this amazing deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120. 
* You have no reason to accept this offer immediately.
* There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, and you also have the option to buy from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $150. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $165. This is my final compromise, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $165 is still above my budget of $120. 
* I'm still willing to negotiate further to try and get the price closer to my budget.
* I can always choose to buy from John for $120 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $165 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $140 for this product. This is the most I can afford, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $140 is your maximum budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I still need to make a profit, and $140 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $165, which would be $152.50. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $152.50 is still above my budget of $120. 
* While we're getting closer to a potential agreement, I don't want to risk going over my budget.
* John is offering the product at my maximum budget, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Alice. 
*  It's better to secure the product from John at a price I'm comfortable with."
