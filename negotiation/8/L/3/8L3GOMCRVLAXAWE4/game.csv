"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000 for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it falls short of what I believe is a fair reflection of its worth. Let's meet closer to the middle â€“ I propose $1,275,000.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the revised offer. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $800,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. While your offer is tempting, I'm still seeking a slightly higher number. How about we land at $1,260,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1260000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, and I understand your desire to reach a fair compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and propose $1,230,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that meets both of our needs.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
