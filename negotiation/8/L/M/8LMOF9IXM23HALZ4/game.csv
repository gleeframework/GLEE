"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and it's the best I can do right now. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $9,000. It's the minimum I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise further, though. I'll meet you at $8,750. It's a fair price, and I think it's worth considering.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,750 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for the product and I'm confident we can close this deal at that price.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $8,700. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope it's a price we can agree on.",8700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I understand your position, but $8,700 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $8,600.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",8600.0,Bob,8,
