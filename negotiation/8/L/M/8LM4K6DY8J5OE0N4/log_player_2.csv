"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than the $15,000 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000. I understand your position, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about $12,000?  That's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $12,000 is within Bob's budget.**  It's a good deal, considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **It's still a better price than John's offer of $15,000.**
* **Continuing to negotiate may not result in a significantly lower price.**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and it's likely that further rounds of negotiation will only yield small price reductions.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $12,000 is the most financially advantageous decision for Bob."
