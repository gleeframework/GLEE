Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $80 to me. I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $70 is too low. While I'd like to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum value. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering $85 to Bob. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum value. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still too low.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not sure we'll reach a price that's agreeable to both of us.  I'd rather sell the product to John for $80, which guarantees me a price I'm happy with."
