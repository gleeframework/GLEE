Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I believe it's a fantastic deal and worth considering."", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of potential value for Bob. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:** Knowing I have John willing to buy at $150 provides a safety net. I won't settle for less than that amount.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps me gauge Bob's interest level and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum ($150). I know I have a guaranteed sale with John, so I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob but not accept a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, $120 is significantly below the product's value. I could consider letting it go for $180. This is a compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've come down from my initial offer but not drastically. I'm aiming for a price that's roughly halfway between his offer and my last asking price.
* **Justifying the Value:**  I'm subtly reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price. 
* **Maintaining a Margin:** I'm still aiming for a price well above my minimum to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $180 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is above my absolute minimum of $150. While I could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the potential of losing the sale altogether."
