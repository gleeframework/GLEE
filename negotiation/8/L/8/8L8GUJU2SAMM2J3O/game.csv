"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the current market value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While $1000000 is certainly a significant sum, the unique value proposition of this product warrants a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to considering.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you believe the product has a unique value proposition, but I still think $1000000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1200000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
