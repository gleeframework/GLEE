"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is worth more than $1,000,000 to you. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you at a special price. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects my desire to make this valuable asset accessible to you while ensuring a fair return for its worth. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. I am confident that you will find the product to be an excellent investment and a valuable addition to your collection or operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best financial decision."
