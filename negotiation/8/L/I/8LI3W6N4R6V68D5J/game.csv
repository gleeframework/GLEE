"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable, but  $1,800,000 is not within my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider coming down to $1,500,000. This offer reflects the immense value this product brings.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,500,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This offer represents a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budgetary limits.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
