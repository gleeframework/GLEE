# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $18,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $12,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he's willing to pay. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
