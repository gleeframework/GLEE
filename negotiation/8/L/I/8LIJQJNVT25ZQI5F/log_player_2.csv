Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than my upper limit and what John is offering.  I need to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work. This is a great price for a product that you value at $15,000. What do you say?

While Alice came down a bit, her offer is still above my ideal price and what John is offering. I'll try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $13,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $14,500? This is a very fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's try to make this work.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and I'm not saving a significant amount compared to John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
