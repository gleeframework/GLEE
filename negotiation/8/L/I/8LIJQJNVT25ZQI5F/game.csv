"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Do you think that would work?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work. This is a great price for a product that you value at $15,000. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a firm budget.  How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $13,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $14,500? This is a very fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's try to make this work. ",14500.0,Alice,5,
