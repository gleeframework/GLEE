Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you the product for $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made significant progress in negotiating the price down.  While Alice's offer is slightly above Bob's ideal,  $11,750 is still a good deal compared to buying from John for $15,000.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and closes the deal."
