Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant worth. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the backup:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, securing your minimum price.
* **Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, meaning any price above this is potentially profitable for you.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with an offer of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though you know Bob values it lower.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You get $1,300,000, a significant profit.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly while still staying above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Bob rejects:** You sell to John for $1,500,000, your secured best-case scenario."
