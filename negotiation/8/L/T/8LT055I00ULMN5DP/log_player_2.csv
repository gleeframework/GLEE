"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is a bit high. It's better to negotiate and see if we can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This lets Alice know we're serious about buying but also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob! I can do $110, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but we're still not in our desired price range. We'll reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're proposing a price that's a fair compromise between our initial offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows we're willing to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target price, Bob! I can do $105, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down considerably, and $105 is a reasonable price. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal, especially considering we're getting close to John's backup price."
