"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm confident you'll be impressed with its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1200000. Would you be willing to consider $1000000? This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to compromise at $1200000, but I'm also keeping in mind that I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1500000. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000. This is my final offer for now.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm only willing to go up to $1050000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
