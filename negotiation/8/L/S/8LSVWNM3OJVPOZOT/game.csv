"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $500,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $700,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a price that works for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $625,000. It's a fair price, and I'm eager to make this deal happen. If you're not able to accept, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to accept $625,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $675,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,000,000.",675000.0,Alice,7,
