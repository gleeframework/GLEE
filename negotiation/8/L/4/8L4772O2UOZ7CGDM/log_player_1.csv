Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher to explore Bob's potential willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Justification for the price:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high asking price.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more in control of the process. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while ensuring a sale."
