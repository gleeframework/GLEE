"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product is impressive, I believe $1,500,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be comfortable at $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
