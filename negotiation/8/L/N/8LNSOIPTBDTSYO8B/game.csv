"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you, I am willing to lower the price to $10,500. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while making the product accessible to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to sell the product for $10,250. This still reflects the product's value to you while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit.",10250.0,Alice,5,
