"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to capture some of the potential surplus.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll use the next round to counteroffer and hopefully close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer and closer to what I'm aiming for.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, as it's likely better than his alternative of walking away and potentially facing a higher price later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over John's offer and getting closer to my target. With only 6 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation isn't worth it, and I'm confident I can make up the difference with other ventures."
