The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $1,800,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's target price.  It's best to reject and see if Alice will negotiate down."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,550,000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also being clear about my budget constraints."
