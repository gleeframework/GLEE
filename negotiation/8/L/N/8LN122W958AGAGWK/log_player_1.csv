Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you make a profit while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob understands exactly what you're proposing. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. You're aiming to maximize your earnings, and there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, you can try to push for a price closer to your desired $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100. Would you be willing to go to $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:** Demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  Ensures you're making a decent profit.
* **It's reasonable:**  A $5 difference is a small step towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining your goal of maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price close to $100, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about we meet in the middle at $92? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is a good compromise. It's only $2 away from your previous offer of $95, and it's closer to your desired profit margin than selling to John for $120.  While you could continue negotiating, accepting this offer allows you to close the deal quickly and avoid the risk of Bob backing out or John making a counteroffer."
