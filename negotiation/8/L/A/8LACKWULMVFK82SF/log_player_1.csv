{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm starting the price at $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, acknowledging that you are open to negotiation. This allows for room to potentially earn more than the minimum $100 while still being open to reaching a compromise with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, there is still potential for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to explore if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to liking the product, but I'm still a bit shy of $135. How about we meet at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $125 is close to my desired price point, and significantly better than selling to John for $100.  It's time to accept and finalize the sale."
