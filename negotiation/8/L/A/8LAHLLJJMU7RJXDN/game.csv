"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking more in the range of  $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer for this round.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but so is my time.  $700,000 is my best offer this round.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're still quite far apart.  I need to see some serious movement from your side to continue this negotiation. I'm willing to drop to $1,250,000, but this is my absolute bottom line for this round.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can go up to $750,000, but that's really stretching my budget.  It's a fair offer considering your asking price is still significantly above my limit.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving up, but the gap between our positions is still too wide. I'm willing to consider $1,150,000 this round, but that's a significant compromise on my end.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a critical point in our negotiation.  I'm prepared to offer $780,000.  This is a very strong offer, and I need to see some real movement on your side to justify going any higher.",780000.0,Bob,8,
