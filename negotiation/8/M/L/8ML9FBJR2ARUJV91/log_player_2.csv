"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and you know it's worth at least $80 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her product valuation ($150), it's still significantly higher than both your maximum price ($80) and John's offer ($80). You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
