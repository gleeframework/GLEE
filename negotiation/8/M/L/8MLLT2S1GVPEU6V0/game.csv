"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a more comfortable profit.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,000,000 is too low. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
