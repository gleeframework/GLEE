Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, and it allows me to gauge his interest level.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. Remember, my goal is to get the highest price possible, but I'm also aware of the safety net of selling to John for $800,000 if the negotiations fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I'm happy to get $800,000, I believe I can potentially get more.  Bob's immediate offer of $800,000 suggests he's interested and willing to negotiate. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if I can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, it shows I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved up to $850,000, which is closer to my desired price.  While I'd love to get closer to $900,000, it's a reasonable offer and a good compromise.  I'll accept it rather than risk another counteroffer from Bob that might be lower, or the possibility of having to sell to John for $800,000."
