"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
Reason:Alice's starting price is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price. 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```
```tool_code
Reason:I'll start with a low offer, significantly below my budget, to give myself room for negotiation.  This strategy might encourage Alice to propose a more reasonable counteroffer.
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

```tool_code
Reason:While $95 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get it closer to $80. 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me a little, Alice, but $95 is still a bit steep for me.  Could you do $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

```tool_code
Reason:I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but staying firm below my $80 maximum.  This keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further.
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I can't go as low as $75. How about we split the difference again and land at $85? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

```tool_code
Reason:Alice is firm at $85 and called it her final offer. It's not worth the risk of her sticking to that price and me losing out on the opportunity to buy it for $80 from John.
