"Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$650,000 is a very good price, but we don't know Alice's minimum acceptable price. We can try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. We'll see if she accepts or counters with a price closer to our offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $650,000 to $525,000. This is a significant reduction and we are now much closer to our desired price range.  While we could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting our next counteroffer and us ending up with John's much higher price is too high. Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of a worse outcome."
