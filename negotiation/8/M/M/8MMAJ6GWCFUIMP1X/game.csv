"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
