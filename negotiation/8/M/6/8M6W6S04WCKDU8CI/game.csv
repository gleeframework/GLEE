"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the opportunity cost of not selling to John. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I value the product at $900,000, and I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. However, if you're willing to meet me halfway, I'd be open to discussing a price closer to $950,000. This would allow us to move forward with a transaction that is satisfactory for both parties.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more and meet you at $1,050,000. This would allow us to both walk away with a win, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the alternative offers I have.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. I am willing to consider $1,000,000 as a final offer. This would allow us to close the deal while keeping the transaction fair for both parties.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
