"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?  That feels like a fair price to me.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of this product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get us to a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
