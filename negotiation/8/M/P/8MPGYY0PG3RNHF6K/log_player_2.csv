"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer significantly below my actual maximum price gives me room to negotiate upwards.  It also lets Alice know I'm serious about buying, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm afraid $6,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still higher than John's price. I'll counter-offer to see if I can negotiate closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm moving closer to my maximum price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This counter-offer signals that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching a deal. However, $7,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,500. This is the final price I can consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice increased her offer! This suggests she's not very flexible.  It's unlikely I'll get a price from her that's better than John's offer of $8,000.  It's time to walk away and take the guaranteed deal from John."
