"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm afraid $6,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching a deal. However, $7,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,500. This is the final price I can consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,5,
