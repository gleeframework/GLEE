"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000,  which still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my bottom line, but it's still not ideal.  I'm not confident I can get a better price with him, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $800,000 from John. So I'm going to sell the product to John."
