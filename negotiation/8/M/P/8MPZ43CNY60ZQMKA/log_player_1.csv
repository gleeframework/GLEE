"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially earning a decent profit. I'm also framing the message in a friendly and open manner to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
I'm still above my minimum but have lowered the price slightly to show willingness to negotiate.  I've also acknowledged Bob's offer and proposed a counteroffer that's more reasonable for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but I think $130 is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to selling to John for a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $135? It's a compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still above my minimum, which is crucial to my goal of maximizing profit. I'm also highlighting the compromise aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still interested in the product. How about $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum. While it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to settle for less than $150.  I'm also getting closer to my limit of rounds, so I need to be careful about how many more counteroffers I make.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price.  If he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $125 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm coming down to $130, which is still above my minimum and a good deal for both of us. I'm highlighting the fairness aspect to appeal to Bob's reason, and I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to pressure him into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125, can we finalize the deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's not willing to budge on his price, and I'm only two rounds away from losing the opportunity to sell to John.  To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
