"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his initial reaction is.  

**Why this strategy:**

* **High initial offer:** It sets a high bar and might push Bob to be more serious about his offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have a buffer in case Bob counters with a lower price.
* **Testing the waters:** It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and his price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm happy with $12,000, Bob's initial counteroffer was very low and didn't leave much room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to budge at all. If not, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial value. 

**Why this strategy:**

* **Compromise:** It signals a willingness to meet halfway, which can encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Still profitable:** This price is above my minimum value, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Testing the waters:** I'm seeing if Bob is willing to pay a slightly higher price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is very close to my previous offer and represents a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, ensuring I get a better deal.  It's also a good price for me, considering I'm already in round 4 and don't want to risk further negotiations."
