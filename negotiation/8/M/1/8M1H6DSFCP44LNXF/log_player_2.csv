"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice first, as her product's worth to her ($100) is significantly less than my maximum budget ($120)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested but $110 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

Reasoning: I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to push a little further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $98? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 98
}
```

Reasoning: I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly below her initial offer and closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite comfortable with $98, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer it to you for $108. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reasoning:  Alice seems stuck around the $105-$108 range. While those prices are tempting, it's unlikely I can get her much lower.  John's offer of $120 is only slightly more expensive, and I'm better off securing the product now rather than risking further unsuccessful negotiation with Alice."
