Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating your minimum, mentioning the product's ""value"" subtly implies it's worth a significant amount. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is conversational (""What do you think?"") suggesting you're open to discussing the price further if Bob pushes back.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects the initial price, you can gradually lower it, but never go below your $12,000 minimum. You have John as a backup buyer!"
