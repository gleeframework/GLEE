{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's advantageous for me, while still being somewhat reasonable for Bob. It's likely he'll counteroffer, giving us the opportunity to negotiate a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $700,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $700,000.  I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $750,000?  It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good investment."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $750,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $725,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $725,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I've already made a significant compromise.  John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid any further risk of lowering my price."
