"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is around $8000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $10000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $10500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $9500, which is closer to your offer but still within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I need to stay above $10000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $10200? It's a fair compromise, and a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer but I need to stay closer to my budget.  How about $9800?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach a deal. What do you think?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $9800 just isn't enough for me. To be honest, I'm getting close to selling to someone else for a much higher price.  However, I'm willing to do one final compromise. How about $10000?  It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
