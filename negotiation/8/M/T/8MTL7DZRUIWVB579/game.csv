"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
