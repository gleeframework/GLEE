""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I've researched your needs and believe this could be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim to secure the highest possible price, significantly exceeding my minimum ($800,000).
* **Strategic Positioning:** Knowing the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000), I've positioned the price ($1,300,000) to provide him a substantial discount while still securing a significant profit for myself.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By highlighting the ""one-time offer,"" I aim to encourage a prompt and positive response from Bob. 
* **Alternative Option:**  While John provides a safety net, my focus is to capitalize on Bob's higher valuation."
