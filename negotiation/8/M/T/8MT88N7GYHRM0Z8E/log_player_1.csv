Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential negotiation and a higher profit margin.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $950,000 is significantly more than Bob's valuation but leaves room for him to counter-offer. 
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer before going to another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines."
