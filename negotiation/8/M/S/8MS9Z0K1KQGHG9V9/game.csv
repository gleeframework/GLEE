"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This price is still a significant profit for you and a good deal for me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the closest I can come without losing too much myself.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
