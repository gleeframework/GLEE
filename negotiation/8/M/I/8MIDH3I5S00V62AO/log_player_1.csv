Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) to be made.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, potentially leading to rejection.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Acknowledging the ""unique value proposition"" subtly reinforces the product's worth to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 splits the potential profit, giving both you and Bob a significant gain.
* **Confidence:** By stating your price belief directly, you project confidence in your offer, making it feel less negotiable.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach.  Depending on your relationship with Bob and your negotiation style, you might adjust the message and price. However, the core principle remains: aim for a win-win where you maximize profit while ensuring Bob sees value in the deal."
