Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  However, I'm also aware that John is a guaranteed buyer for $1,500,000, so I'm not going to go too far above that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price that I'll accept it.  It's better than selling to John for $1,500,000."
