Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,500,000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer.  While I could try to negotiate further with Bob, there's a risk he won't go higher. Accepting John's offer guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
