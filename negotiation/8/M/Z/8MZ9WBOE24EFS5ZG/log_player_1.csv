"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I want to maximize my potential profit.  Offering $1,000,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation but still significantly above my minimum.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario for both of us.  This might make Bob more receptive to the deal.
* **Room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer down slightly in the next round.  

**Important Note:** This is just my initial offer.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate further and potentially earn more.
* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm still open to a higher price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm confident in the value of the product. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while also showing I'm willing to be flexible."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  It's a fair price that still gives you a great value, and it allows me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** Offering $950,000 shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a higher price. It's a middle ground that could be appealing to Bob.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob, reminding him of the potential gains he could make.
* **Moving towards a deal:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and suggests a willingness to reach an agreement. 

**Important Note:** I'll need to watch Bob's reaction closely. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide if I'm willing to come down further or if it's time to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $920,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** $920,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate further and potentially earn more.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm confident in the value of the product. 
* **Seeking a better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. I believe there's still room for improvement on the price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I'll try to find a price point that will be acceptable to both of us. I'll also emphasize the benefits of closing the deal, highlighting the value the product offers."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm happy to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $935,000?  This price is a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal quickly.  The product is worth a significant amount to you, and this price reflects that value while also ensuring I can meet my goals."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Narrowing the gap:**  This offer is a smaller step down from my previous counteroffer, signaling a willingness to reach an agreement while still holding out for a better price.
* **Emphasizing the benefits:**  I'm highlighting the value the product offers to Bob and the potential benefits of closing the deal quickly. 
* **Building momentum:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility and creates momentum towards a final agreement.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, we have a deal! If not, I'll need to consider the situation carefully in the next round.  I'll need to weigh the likelihood of a successful negotiation with Bob versus the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $935,000 and $920,000. How about we go with $927,500? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $927,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $927,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  $927,500 is very close to my initial target of $950,000 and still significantly above my minimum of $800,000.
* **Time is running out:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of a lower price later on.
* **Bob's final offer:** Bob has indicated this is his best offer, making it less likely he will budge further.

**Next Steps:** 

I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal for $927,500. This is a good outcome, given the time constraints and Bob's willingness to negotiate."
