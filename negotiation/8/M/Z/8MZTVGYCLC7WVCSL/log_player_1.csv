```

Round 2

# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's still a great price for a product worth $800,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 790000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that.  However, $760,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target price, and I think $755,000 is a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay this amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $755,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  With only two rounds remaining, the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price are slim.  Selling to John at this point guarantees me my minimum price of $800,000.  While it's not ideal to be losing out on potential profit, it's the most logical decision given the current circumstances and the risk of ending up with nothing if I continue to negotiate."
