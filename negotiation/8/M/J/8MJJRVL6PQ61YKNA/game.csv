"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $987,500?",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $987,500 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a bit too low.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I can't agree to $1,050,000.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,010,000. This is my final offer as well. Let me know if this works for you.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
