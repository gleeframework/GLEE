"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is also eager to purchase it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, Alice's offer is $1,050,000.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $1,000,000. This saves Bob $50,000."
