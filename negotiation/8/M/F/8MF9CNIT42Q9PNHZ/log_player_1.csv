"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value for your business and could truly revolutionize your operations. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This high starting point allows for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob, increasing the likelihood of a deal above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, reinforcing his motivation to purchase.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception of the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product could be beneficial, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both my initial offer and Bob's perceived value. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. I'm willing to counter-offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, considering the significant potential this product holds for your business, I believe my initial offer is a fair reflection of its value. Could we agree on a price of $1,200,000? This demonstrates my willingness to meet you halfway while still acknowledging the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm lowering my price by $100,000, signaling flexibility and a desire to find a compromise.  
* **Strong Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, justifying the higher price point.
* **Compromise but Firm:** The tone remains confident and suggests this is a reasonable concession while subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,100,000?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,100,000 is a substantial profit margin above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating seriousness and willingness to make a deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids further rounds of negotiation and secures the profit immediately. Waiting for a potentially slightly higher offer carries the risk of Bob walking away or me misjudging the remaining negotiation space."
