"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is more around $1200000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I can do $1800000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference -  I'm happy to pay $1500000.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
