"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $1,200,000. I believe this is still a fair price given the product's value to me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option.  $1,100,000 is a good price, and it's worth locking it in rather than risking a further rejection and potentially having to settle for John's offer."
