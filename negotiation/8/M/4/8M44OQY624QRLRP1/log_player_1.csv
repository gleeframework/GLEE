Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but is more in line with my budget.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently incrementing his offers in smaller amounts, signaling he's unlikely to reach our $1,000,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, making it the safer and more profitable option at this point."
