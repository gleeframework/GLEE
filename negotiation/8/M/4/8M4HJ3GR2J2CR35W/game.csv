"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $10,600 for the product. What do you say?",10600.0,Bob,4,
