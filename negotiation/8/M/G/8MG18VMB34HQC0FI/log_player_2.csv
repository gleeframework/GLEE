"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price, knowing its worth to you.  Let's make a deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility open for Alice to lower her price, or allows Bob to explore other options."
