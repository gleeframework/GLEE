""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $8,000, Bob values the product much higher. My goal is to maximize my profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $12,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob saves $3,000 compared to his perceived value, and I make a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, while still ensuring a good profit margin for myself."
