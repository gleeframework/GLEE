# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you have a backup option with John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $80.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
