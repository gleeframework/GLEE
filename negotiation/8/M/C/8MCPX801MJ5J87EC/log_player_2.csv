"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, Bob can still save money by negotiating. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to lower the price to get a deal, especially since she's already offered a price lower than her own valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $875,000 to show you my commitment to this deal. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now only $75,000 higher than Bob's maximum budget. Accepting this offer is a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's a risk Alice could walk away and Bob would have to buy from John, which would cost the same."
