"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $875,000 to show you my commitment to this deal. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Alice,3,
