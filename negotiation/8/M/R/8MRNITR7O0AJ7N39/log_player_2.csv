# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $11,625. I'm still a bit short of my target, and I'd like to get closer to my desired price.

It's time to cut losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $12,000 and is now moving further away from that point. John's offer, while not ideal, guarantees a price cap and prevents further haggling."
