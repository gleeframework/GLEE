"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $12,000 is a little steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500 was a bit too low for me, but $11,000 is still a bit too low. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,250. This is my best offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $11,625. I'm still a bit short of my target, and I'd like to get closer to my desired price. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product.",13000.0,Alice,7,
