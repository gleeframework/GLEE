"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you a price of $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
