You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. By offering $850,000, he's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is higher than Bob's counteroffer and still quite close to the price he'd pay from John. While it's tempting to accept, Bob still wants to save as much as possible. He can try to counter again, potentially reaching a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. His previous offer was rejected, so he's increasing it slightly to $900,000, which is still a better deal for him than buying from John. This offer shows he's willing to compromise while still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to John's price.  Bob has already made several counteroffers and it seems unlikely Alice will budge much further. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 than to continue negotiating with Alice.  He's guaranteed to get the product at a known price, avoiding the risk of further rejection and potential stalemate."
