"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I believe it's a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive message sets a good tone for the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the perceived value of the product to make my offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob by rejecting his offer and counter-offering.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to negotiate.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is always available, but I want to exhaust all negotiation options with Bob before settling for that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages a successful negotiation.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This is a common negotiation tactic that shows you're meeting Bob halfway and are open to a reasonable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While close to my minimum, $128 still doesn't meet my desired profit margin. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm still hopeful of getting a better price, and I have several rounds remaining to negotiate.
* **Risk of Losing to John:**  While John's offer is tempting, I believe I can still secure a better deal with Bob. 
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate for a sale, which could encourage him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $128 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $131?  I'm willing to make a final concession to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 131}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility without compromising my desired profit. 
* **Final Concession:** Stating this is a ""final concession"" creates urgency and pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This tactic emphasizes a sense of fairness and compromise, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Time Pressure:** As we're nearing the midpoint of negotiations, I need to secure a deal quickly before John becomes a more appealing option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $126? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $126 is too low for me, and we are already at the halfway point of our negotiations. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  I've made several concessions already, and further negotiating with Bob might lead to a lower price or a drawn-out process.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $150 is significantly more appealing and would guarantee my minimum profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only four rounds remaining, it's crucial to secure a deal quickly before John's offer becomes more tempting. 

Selling to John guarantees a quick and profitable sale, minimizing the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
