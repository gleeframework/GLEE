"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit margin.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial ask.  Let's meet closer to the middle. How about we consider $1,150,000?  This reflects a substantial profit for you while still recognizing the inherent worth of what I'm offering.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I am too.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I was hoping for, I'm still not quite there.  I'd be happy to offer $1,050,000.  This reflects a compromise that allows for a healthy profit for both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here, and I respect your approach.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and profitable outcome for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
