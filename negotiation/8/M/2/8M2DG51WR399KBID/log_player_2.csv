Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the continued discussion. I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is  below what I can accept. Let's settle this right now: how about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This demonstrates how serious I am about finding a fair deal for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I respect your position and I'm motivated to close this deal. My final offer is $815,000. This is a very small margin for me, but I value finding an agreement with you.

Alice is unlikely to go below $815,000, and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is your target price."
