Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That initial price is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  To be honest, $925,000 is still a bigger investment than I had in mind. I could potentially stretch my budget to $725,000, but that's really my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and engaging in the negotiation. While $725,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum and John's offer. I believe I can negotiate further and close the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the continued discussion. I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is  below what I can accept. Let's settle this right now: how about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This demonstrates how serious I am about finding a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm willing to offer $775,000.  This is a very strong offer, and I need to be realistic about my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer to my baseline, but his ""take it or leave it"" tone suggests there's still room to negotiate.  I'll push a bit further, but I'm prepared to take John's offer if Bob doesn't budge significantly in the next round."
