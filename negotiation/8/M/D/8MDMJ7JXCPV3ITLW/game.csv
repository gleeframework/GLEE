"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still unable to accept that at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950000.  This would still provide you with a significant gain, while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return on the product.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
