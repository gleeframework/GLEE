"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $800,000, and while I value it significantly higher, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my own valuation, and I believe it's a fair offer given the product's potential benefits to your company.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
