"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer and counteroffer.  He can potentially save a lot of money by negotiating.  $999,000 is still a significant amount of money, and he has room to negotiate further."

I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $999000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $920000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value and your interest in it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it is lower than her original offer, it's still a significant amount of money, and he has room to negotiate further.  He can likely get a better price with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $850000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $880000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and then raising her price again is high. At this point,  Alice is very close to his maximum price of $850,000, so it is likely in his best interest to accept and save $320,000 compared to buying from John."
