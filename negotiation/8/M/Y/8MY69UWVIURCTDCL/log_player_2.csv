"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. It's likely he can negotiate a lower price with Alice, as she's clearly motivated to sell. Rejecting the offer allows him to start a counter-offer process, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise.  Bob has already saved $50,000 from the initial offer. While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or become less flexible.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
