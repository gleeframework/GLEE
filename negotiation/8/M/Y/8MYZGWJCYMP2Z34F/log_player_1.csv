Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm asking for $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high.  A price of $1,200,000 gives you significant room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but invites Bob to engage in a discussion, leaving space for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still recognizing that Bob has a viable alternative and might not be willing to pay significantly more than his perceived value."
