"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I recognize its potential value, $90 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $85. Would you consider that?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $85 and $90. How about $87? It's a fair middle ground that still reflects the product's value to me.",87.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to split the difference and offer $86. It's a fair price that gives you some profit and stays within my budget.",86.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at $88? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I'm willing to give you a good deal. Let me know if that works for you.",88.0,Alice,5,
