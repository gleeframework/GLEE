Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the unique opportunity to acquire this product, but $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our initial ask. While we want to maximize profit, jumping to John at $1,000,000 feels premature. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?  I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is moving closer to our desired price point, and while we could push further, accepting at $1,500,000 secures a significant profit.  There's always a risk Bob will drop out in later rounds, so accepting now guarantees a strong return."
