"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay a little more than my minimum, but I want to see if he'll bite at this price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I believe I can get a better deal, especially since Bob clearly values the product at $100.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal.  I'm not sure how much more I can get out of Bob, but I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

I'm going to offer $88. This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting this deal done. It's also a good middle ground between my last offer and Bob's current offer. If he rejects this, I'll be very close to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting late in the game, and I'm running out of rounds. While $86 is still below my ideal price, it's getting close to the minimum. I'm worried that Bob will continue to offer lower prices, and I might end up selling to John for $80. So, I'll accept Bob's offer."
