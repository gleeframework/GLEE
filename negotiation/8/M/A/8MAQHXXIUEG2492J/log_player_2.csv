"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $100
* **Your Maximum Value:** $120
* **John's Price:** $120

Since Alice's offer is below your maximum value and is a better deal than John's, it makes sense to accept it."
