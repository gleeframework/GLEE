"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and it leaves you with a good margin to make a profit. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to secure a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit and still give you a great deal.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us. It allows you to recoup a significant portion of the product's value and lets me secure a better price than I could get elsewhere.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
