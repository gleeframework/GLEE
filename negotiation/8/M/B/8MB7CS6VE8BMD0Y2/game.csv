"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is far too low. Considering the value to you and the potential benefits, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price is still significantly below my asking price but reflects the value you see in the product. Let's aim for a deal that's fair to both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds significant value, but $1,200,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. ",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $600,000 is simply not enough. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my original asking price and leaves room for further negotiation.  I believe it's a fair price that allows you to secure the product while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on my investment. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
