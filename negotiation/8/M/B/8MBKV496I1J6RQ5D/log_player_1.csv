Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference at $12,250? This is a fair price for both of us. It's a good compromise and allows us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}

Round 6
