"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its unique value and potential. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downward and still potentially make a good profit.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm emphasizing the value and potential of the product, aiming to pique Bob's interest and create a sense of urgency.
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm inviting Bob to communicate and express his thoughts, signaling I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Safety net:**  I have John as a backup buyer for $800,000, so I can walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Ten rounds:** I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $800,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my original $1 million.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product, making it clear that $950,000 is still a good deal.
* **Meet in the middle:** I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, making it seem like a fair and reasonable compromise.
* **Urgency:** I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward to keep Bob engaged and hopefully secure a deal before John's offer becomes more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but there's still room for improvement. 
* **Focus on the long game:** I have several rounds left to negotiate, and I'm hoping to secure a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $800,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $920,000 is closer, it's still a little below my desired price point. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $935,000. This would represent a fair compromise and ensure a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident that with this price, you'll find this product to be a valuable investment."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** I'm again acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on a fair compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasize value and investment:** I'm reiterating the product's value and positioning it as a good investment for Bob.
* **Create a sense of urgency:** I'm stating that this offer represents a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" implying that if Bob doesn't accept, a deal may not be reached. 

By offering a price closer to Bob's, I'm hoping to increase the chances of acceptance.  However, I'm still aiming for a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $935000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $915000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:**  Bob's offer is getting very close to my desired price, and I'm running out of time.
* **Final offer:** Bob has stated that this is his final offer, so there's a risk that further negotiations could lead to a breakdown. 
* **Value for money:** $915,000 is still a good price for the product, especially since John is only offering $800,000. 

It's time to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high."
