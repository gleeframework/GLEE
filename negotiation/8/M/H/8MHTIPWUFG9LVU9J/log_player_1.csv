{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. It leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. $85 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $92.50? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $90 is getting close to my minimum.  Since Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher, I'll accept his offer to secure the sale."
