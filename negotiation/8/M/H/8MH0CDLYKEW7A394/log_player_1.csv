{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's perceived value of the product, making it more likely he'll consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than $80, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $100.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my original price. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92.50. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer $95, $92.50 is still a good price and getting closer to my goal.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, or a long and drawn-out process.  Accepting now ensures a sale and a decent profit."
