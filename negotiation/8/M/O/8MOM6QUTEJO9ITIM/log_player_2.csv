Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

*  It's better to continue negotiating than to settle for a price that exceeds his budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close to reaching an agreement, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, which is a significant concession from my original offer. I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and my original offer. I'm thinking of $16500. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $16,500 is still above Bob's budget of $15,000. 
* There are only a few rounds left, and continuing to negotiate with Alice could potentially result in a price that is still higher than Bob's budget.

*  This guarantees he gets the product at a price he can afford."
