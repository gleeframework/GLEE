"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go, as it aligns with my budget and the value I see in this item. Let me know if you're open to this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $14,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the revised offer. While I appreciate the discount, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and aligns with my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is still a discount from my initial offer. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and is worth considering. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,5,
