"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant benefits. My initial offer is $18,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000.  He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go, as it aligns with my budget and the value I see in this item. Let me know if you're open to this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $14,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and get the price lower.  He still has time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the revised offer. While I appreciate the discount, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and aligns with my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is still a discount from my initial offer. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and is worth considering. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's budget, and he's already had several rounds of negotiation.  It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $13,000, which is still too high. 

By buying from John for $12,000, Bob gets the best price and avoids further negotiation."
