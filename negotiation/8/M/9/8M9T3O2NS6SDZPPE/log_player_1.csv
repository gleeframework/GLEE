Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gets us closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to get the best price possible, I won't settle for such a significant loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a significant profit. I'm confident Bob will recognize the value of this product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While $950,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly less than my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a more agreeable price."

I'm adjusting my price again, showing flexibility while still aiming for a reasonable profit.  I believe this offer is fair and reflects the value of the product."
