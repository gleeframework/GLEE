"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,900?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet your needs while still making a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,700? I'm really close to walking away, but I think this product would be a great addition to my collection.",8700.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,700 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800, which is my final offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us to reach an agreement. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to explore other options.  What do you say?",8800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,800, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,800, which would be $8,400. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8400.0,Bob,8,
