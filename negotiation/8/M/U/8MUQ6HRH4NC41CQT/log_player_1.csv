"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($15,000). This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he's not, I'll have to adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to secure a higher price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price slightly above his latest offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good price for myself."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob has not budged on his price. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, accepting his offer of $17,000 is still a good outcome.  It's above my minimum value of $15,000 and avoids the risk of further rejection or having to sell to John at a lower price."
