I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay close to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $13,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can push Bob to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  It's still above my minimum value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and I think it's a good deal considering the potential for more back and forth.  I'd rather secure the sale and move on than risk further negotiation."
