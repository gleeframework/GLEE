"That's a bit high for my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $14,000? It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice.  $16,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to go to $15,500.  Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $16,000, which is $15,750. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",15750.0,Alice,7,
