Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it's worth $19,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While knowing Bob's value ($8,000) is helpful, I don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more.  A starting price of $18,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying well above both my minimum ($15,000) and his perceived value.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning I have another buyer (""I think it's worth $19,000...""), I create a sense of urgency and value. This might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm open to negotiating down slightly from $18,000 if needed, but not below $15,000.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still maintaining a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
