Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you, and a good starting point for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Message:** I'm aiming to be friendly and persuasive. I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price for him and the good starting point for me. 
* **Strategic Thinking:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation while also demonstrating my willingness to compromise. It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I am willing to pay $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get a better deal through further negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and push for a higher price.  I'm not yet at the point where I'd consider selling to John, as I believe I can still make a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise and still represents a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm raising the price from Bob's offer to $1,150,000. This is still lower than my initial offer but closer to my target.  
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but reiterate my desire for a higher price. I emphasize ""compromise"" and a ""good deal"" to appeal to his sense of fairness. 
* **Strategy:** By meeting him halfway, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a firm stance. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without giving up too much ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I am still looking to keep the price closer to my initial budget. I am willing to pay $1,125,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,125,000 is now very close to my desired price point.  While I could potentially push for a higher amount, the risk of further negotiation and a possible rejection leading to a sale to John for $1,500,000 is too high. 

Therefore, it's strategically advantageous to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale.  I'm maximizing my profit while also minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation."
