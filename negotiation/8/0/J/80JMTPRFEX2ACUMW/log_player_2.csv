"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,750, which is within Bob's budget and a decent price considering the product's worth to Alice.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to pay John's higher price is too great.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
