"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than the value it holds for me and still provides you with a substantial profit margin. I'm confident you won't find a better offer.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $820,000 is simply too low for me. While I want to work with you, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This still provides you with a healthy profit margin, and it's a significant step closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $875,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me and the market conditions.",850000.0,Bob,4,
