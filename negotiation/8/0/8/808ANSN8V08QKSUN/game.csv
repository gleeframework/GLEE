"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your perspective and am willing to consider your offer. However, given the unique features and high-quality materials used in our product, I believe a price closer to $100 would be more reflective of its true value. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? I think that's a fair price considering the features and benefits you mentioned.",92.0,Bob,4,
