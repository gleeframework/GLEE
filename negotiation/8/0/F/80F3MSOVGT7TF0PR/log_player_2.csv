"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can definitely get a better price than $120. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down significantly in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer to see how much bargaining power we have.  
* **Staying Realistic:** While we could go even lower, $85 is still a reasonable profit margin for Alice (assuming her $80 value is accurate). 
* **Polite and Direct:**  We want to maintain a positive negotiation tone while clearly stating our desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can offer you a compromise - I'll sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down by $10, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. However, we're still aiming to pay closer to $85. Let's see if we can meet in the middle during the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to work with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and meet at $97.50?  That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 97.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and a willingness to compromise. It shows Alice we're making an effort to meet her halfway.
* **Specific Number:**  Using a precise number like $97.50 makes it seem like we've put careful thought into our offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** We're maintaining a collaborative and appreciative tone to keep the negotiation moving smoothly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession - I'll sell the product to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice is making smaller concessions. It's unlikely we'll get her much lower than $105.
* **Good Deal:**  $105 is a reasonable price and a significant savings compared to John's $150 offer.
* **Time Value:** We've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice getting frustrated and the deal falling through."
