"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm happy to offer $650,000 for it. I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $650,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm still hesitant at $725,000, but I'm willing to go up to $700,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not convinced that $700,000 is a fair price for this product. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $750,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach.",750000.0,Alice,5,
