"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $120. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $110. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,5,
