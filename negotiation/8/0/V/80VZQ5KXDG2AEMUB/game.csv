"I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price of $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  Let's make this happen.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $13,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $14,500? This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up a little, but I can't go above $13,500.  If you're serious about selling, I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $13,500 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I need to make a profit, and this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,5,
