"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $8,500 is closer to what I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good deal for me. It's lower than John's price and still leaves Alice with a profit. Accepting this offer allows me to save $1,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a good chance I could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice walking away and me having to buy from John isn't worth it."
