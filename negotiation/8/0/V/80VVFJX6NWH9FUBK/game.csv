"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $8,500 is closer to what I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
