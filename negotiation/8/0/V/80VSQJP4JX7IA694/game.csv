"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,375,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit from this valuable asset, and it's closer to my desired value. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,325,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,325,000 is a good starting point, but I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,337,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1337500.0,Bob,4,
