{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 gives you a strong fallback position. 

This offer aims to secure a price that significantly benefits you while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
