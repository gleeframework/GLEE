Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's exact willingness to pay is unknown. By offering a higher price, we can gauge how interested he is and if he might be willing to pay above his perceived value.
* **Fallback Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so there's little risk in starting high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes there's no negative consequence to Bob rejecting the offer (like him being offended by a high price and refusing to negotiate). If relationship building is crucial, a different approach might be necessary."
