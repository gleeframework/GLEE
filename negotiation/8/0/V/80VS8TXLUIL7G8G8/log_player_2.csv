"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love! I'm asking $95 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's not the best deal. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $100, so there's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90. Let's split the difference. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is within your budget and a good compromise.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or you'll end up paying the full $100 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option at this point."
