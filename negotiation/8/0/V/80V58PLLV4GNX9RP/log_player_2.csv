"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still higher than your target of $12,000.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $12,500, which is a significant discount from Alice's offer and is closer to my target price. It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation and shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to be fair."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price. Even though we're nearing the end of the negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with.  I will continue to counteroffer in hopes of finding a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $12,750. This shows that I'm still committed to buying the product and willing to compromise, but it's still below my target price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground before needing to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is now significantly higher than my target price. We're at the halfway point of the negotiations, and while I'm willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely that Alice will budge significantly further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for my target price of $12,000, securing a deal that's within my budget."
