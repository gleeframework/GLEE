{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also positions the product as desirable and opens the conversation for a more personalized discussion.  

Remember, this is just the first step. I'll need to carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers and my assessment of his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle immediately. I believe there's potential to earn more, especially since Bob expressed interest in the product.  Rejecting the offer allows me to explore further negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would allow both of us to come away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

My counteroffer attempts to strike a balance between my desire to maximize profit and the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.  Meeting him halfway signals a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a higher profit than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing Bob altogether. Accepting this offer secures a profit higher than my minimum and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
