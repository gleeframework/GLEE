"Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, $850,000 is slightly out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $775,000 for it. This is a fair price given my budget constraints and the product's value. Let me know what you think.",775000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $775,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which still reflects the product's substantial value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,
