"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her minimum acceptable price.  It gives you room to negotiate further if Alice rejects your counteroffer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Rejecting gives you another opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.  Remember, you're trying to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

This counteroffer is a compromise, slightly higher than your previous offer but still lower than Alice's latest offer. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum budget, but it's still too high. You've already made multiple counteroffers, and it's possible that Alice is unwilling to go any lower. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,200,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product within your budget."
