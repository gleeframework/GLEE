{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal ($10 savings) while still giving me a decent profit ($20).  It's a good starting point, and I can adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $140. I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is a decent price, I'm still not ready to sell for that price. I want to see if I can get closer to $130. I will counteroffer Bob one last time and then, if he doesn't budge, I'll sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. This would give you a great deal, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $128, but no higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is only $8 less than my ideal price.  While I'd prefer to get $130, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  Accepting his offer is the best choice here."
