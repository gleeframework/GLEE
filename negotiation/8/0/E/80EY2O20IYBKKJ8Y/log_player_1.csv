"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $11,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll find worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair offer considering we're both getting closer to our desired price.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and closer to my initial asking price. Accepting his offer will allow me to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation."
