"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's aiming for a price closer to $12,000, and Alice's offer is too high.  It's best to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll find worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer again.  While it's lower than her first offer, it's still higher than his target price of $12,000.  He has more negotiating room and it's worth trying to get the price down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair offer considering we're both getting closer to our desired price.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
