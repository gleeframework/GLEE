"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 is certainly appealing, I'm confident this asset's value justifies a higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,025,000? This reflects both of our interests.",2025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $2,025,000 is the right price. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about we aim for $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I believe your valuation undervalues the potential of this asset. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,975,000, but that's my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",1975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,975,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,925,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about we aim for $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Bob,6,
