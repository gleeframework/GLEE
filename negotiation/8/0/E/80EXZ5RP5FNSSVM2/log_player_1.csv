Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is clearly anchored to that $1,800,000 figure. I need to show firmness and willingness to walk away to potentially get a better deal."

While I could hold out longer, accepting Bob's offer of $1,900,000 makes the most sense at this point.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  I'm still securing a $400,000 profit above my minimum ($1,900,000 - $1,500,000 = $400,000).
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a genuine interest.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and lost opportunities.
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's always a risk Bob could walk away, leaving me with John's lower offer.

Accepting a solid offer now outweighs the potential upside of a slightly higher price later, especially given the remaining risks."
