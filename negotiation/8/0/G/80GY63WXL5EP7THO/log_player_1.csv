Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I can make a profit.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encouraging.  It highlights the value of the product without being overly aggressive.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great!  I've secured a sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.  I will also need to weigh the potential of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's important to prioritize maximizing my earnings. 
* **I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.**
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially leading to a better deal.**

**Next Step:** I will now proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a great deal. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $11,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** I'm offering $11,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a profit for myself.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer and explain why it's not acceptable. I then clearly state my counteroffer and highlight the benefits of a deal for both of us.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  By offering a compromise, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Excellent! We have a deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I will need to reassess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer or simply sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $11,500 is slightly above my budget. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is only $500 lower than my previous offer.** This is a small difference and indicates he's getting close to my desired price.
* **Selling to John for $15,000 would be more profitable, but it also carries a risk.**  There's no guarantee that John will still be interested in buying if I reject Bob's offer and take too long to negotiate.
* **Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale with a reasonable profit.**  It's a better outcome than continuing to negotiate and potentially losing both buyers.

**Next Step:** I will accept Bob's offer and sell him the product for $11,000."
