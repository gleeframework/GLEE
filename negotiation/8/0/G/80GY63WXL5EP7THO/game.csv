"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a great deal. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $11,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $11,500 is slightly above my budget. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
