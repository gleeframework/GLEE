# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice is meeting your absolute top price. There's no room for further negotiation unless you want to try a very risky tactic of pretending to walk away.  It's best to accept and close the deal."
