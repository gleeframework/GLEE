Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1 million.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
