"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both room to make a deal. ",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,050,000 is the minimum I can accept. I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price, but I'm not going any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This would be a good compromise and allow us both to close this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's still a good deal for you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that accounts for both our needs and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'll give you a slight concession this time. I'll sell the product to you for $1,060,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,060,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that's within both of our budgets and allows us to finalize this deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement here.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell the product to you for $1,040,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1040000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,040,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,010,000.  This is a fair price that is within both of our budgets and allows us to close this deal. This is my final offer, and I believe it is a good compromise. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to move forward with another seller.",1010000.0,Bob,10,
