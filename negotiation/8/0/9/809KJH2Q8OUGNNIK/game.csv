"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're keen on the product.  While $9500 is tempting, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $11000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's get this deal done.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product!  $10000 is a step in the right direction.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  It's a fair price, and it'll allow us to close this deal quickly.",10500.0,Alice,7,
