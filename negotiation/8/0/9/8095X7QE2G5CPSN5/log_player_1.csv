"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is a good offer, but I believe I can still negotiate a higher price closer to his perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

While I could push for a bit more, $11,500 is a solid offer and significantly above my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely."
