"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,250 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,400. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that you're a serious buyer. Let's close this deal.",10400.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I'm open to finding a solution, $10,300 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $10,350. This is a fair price for both of us. I hope we can reach an agreement.",10350.0,Alice,7,
