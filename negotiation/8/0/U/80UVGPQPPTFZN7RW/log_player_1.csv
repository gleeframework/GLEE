Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where it's more beneficial to sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000.  Bob's offers are getting closer, but it's getting risky to continue negotiating with only two rounds remaining.  It's better to secure a sale at a price that's closer to my minimum."
