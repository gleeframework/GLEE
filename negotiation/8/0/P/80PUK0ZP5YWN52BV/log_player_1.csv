"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if needed, while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer. I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference at $135? It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $132 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to go that low? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum of $130. While I'd prefer to sell for more, I'm running out of time. Accepting this offer will ensure I get a reasonable profit and avoid the risk of a deal falling through."
