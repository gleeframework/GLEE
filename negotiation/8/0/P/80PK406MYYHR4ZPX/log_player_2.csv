"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John.  Since Alice's offer is $12,000, Bob has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's starting with a price that's slightly above that, leaving some room for negotiation.  This counteroffer allows for potential compromise while still saving Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still significantly better than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject any further counteroffers and Bob might be forced to buy from John. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than risk a higher cost."
