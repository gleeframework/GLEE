"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $7,250. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",7250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $7,250 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  Let's try $7,100.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",7100.0,Bob,4,
