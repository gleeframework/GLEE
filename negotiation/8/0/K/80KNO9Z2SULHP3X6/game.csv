"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. While it holds significant value to me, I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair for both of us. I'm proposing a price of $1200000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However, $900000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1050000. This price acknowledges the benefit to you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the value I see in it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to compromise further. However, $950000 still falls short of the true value of this product. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1000000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value you place on the product while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on my investment. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $925000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the value I see in it.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However,  $925000 is simply not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $975000. This reflects the value you see in the product while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's end this negotiation and close the deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,
