Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. While it holds significant value to me, I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair for both of us. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and there's room for improvement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,050,000. This price acknowledges the benefit to you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have more negotiation rounds available. It's worth trying to push for a better offer."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to compromise further. However, $950,000 still falls short of the true value of this product.

Round 6

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However,  $925,000 is simply not a price I can accept.

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in round 8, and the negotiation is starting to stall. Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I have two more rounds to negotiate, but it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my price expectations.

Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better outcome, it's prudent to take the guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000. This ensures I achieve my desired profit and avoid any potential losses from continued negotiation with Bob."
