"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $120. Considering its worth to you, would you be interested in acquiring it at this price? We're confident it will significantly benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $120 to you, and John is also willing to sell it for $120, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to explore other options or potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice in the future."
