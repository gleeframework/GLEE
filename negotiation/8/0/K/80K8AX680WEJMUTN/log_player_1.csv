{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I think it's a fair price given its value and potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer sets a relatively high starting point, giving you room to negotiate down.  $15,000 is a significant amount more than your minimum acceptable price, so it allows for potential concessions without losing too much. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue. 

However, remember that this is just the initial offer!  Based on Bob's response, you will need to adapt your strategy and potentially make counteroffers or even walk away to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired target.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I can make a new offer closer to my preferred price and keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?  That's still a good deal for a product of this quality, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a bit more than your initial offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price point and is a good deal for me.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of a few hundred dollars.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
