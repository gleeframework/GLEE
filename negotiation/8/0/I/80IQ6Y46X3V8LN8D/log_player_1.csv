Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he pushes back a little. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While Alice mentions she'll offer it to John if Bob declines, she doesn't want to rely on that.  The goal is to secure the best price from Bob."
