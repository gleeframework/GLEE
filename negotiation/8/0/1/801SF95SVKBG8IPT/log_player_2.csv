"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $950,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth to both of us. Let's start the negotiation off strong!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $950,000 is too high for me.  How about we start the conversation at $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start negotiations significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Not Insulting:** While starting low, it's also important not to insult Alice with an unrealistically low offer. $600,000 is a significant amount and shows we're serious while also aiming for a significant discount.
* **Gauge Reaction:**  This counteroffer will help gauge Alice's flexibility.  Her response will give us valuable information for our next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** Alice only came down $100,000 from her initial offer. This suggests she might have more room to move.
* **Target in Sight:**  While $850,000 is still a significant amount, it's getting closer to our ideal price range. We need to keep negotiating to see how low Alice is willing to go. 
* **Time Cushion:** We still have plenty of rounds left. Rushing into a deal now might mean leaving money on the table."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer. However, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle on $725,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's value."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We've increased our offer from $600,000 to $725,000. This shows Alice that we are willing to negotiate and move closer to her price range. 
* **Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims for a middle ground between our initial offer and Alice's current price. It shows we are looking for a fair compromise.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While moving closer to her price, we still maintain a firm stance, aiming for a price significantly lower than her current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $725,000 is still a little too low for me.  I understand you have budget constraints, but  I'm willing to go down to $800,000 as a final offer. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value to you, and it's also my minimum acceptable price.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice has explicitly stated that $800,000 is her final offer and her minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Meeting Our Needs:**  This price meets our goal of spending no more than $1,000,000, and it represents a significant savings of $200,000 from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice sticking to her price, which would force us to either buy at $800,000 anyway or resort to John's less favorable offer. Accepting now guarantees the deal."
