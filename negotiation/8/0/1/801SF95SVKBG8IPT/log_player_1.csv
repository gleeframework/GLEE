"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $950,000 is too high for me.  How about we start the conversation at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer. However, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle on $725,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to try to increase the price further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $725,000 is still a little too low for me.  I understand you have budget constraints, but  I'm willing to go down to $800,000 as a final offer. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value to you, and it's also my minimum acceptable price.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
