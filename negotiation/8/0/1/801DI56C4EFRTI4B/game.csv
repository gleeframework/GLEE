"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and represents a significant investment on my part. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value you're offering while also respecting my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
