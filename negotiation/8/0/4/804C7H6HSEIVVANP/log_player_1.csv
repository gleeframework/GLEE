This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 but I'm leaving room for negotiation. I'm also mentioning the value to Bob to emphasize the deal's potential for him. This should encourage him to counter-offer rather than reject outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I can only pay up to $850000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I will counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap further."
