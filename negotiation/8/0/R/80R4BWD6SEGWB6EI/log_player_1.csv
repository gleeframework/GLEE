Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and while I want to make a deal, that's too low. I'll try to meet him closer to the middle.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand where you're coming from. While $10,500 is a bit too high for my budget, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.
