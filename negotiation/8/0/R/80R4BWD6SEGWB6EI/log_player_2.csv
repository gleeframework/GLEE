"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a steal! I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500. What do you think?"",

}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price down significantly. It's a starting point for negotiation, and we can adjust it based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming back with a number. To be honest, $6,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I could be convinced to let it go for $10,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly above our ideal price and our maximum budget.  We need to signal we're serious but not willing to overpay. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand where you're coming from. While $10,500 is a bit too high for my budget, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 7500
}
```

We are increasing our offer, showing Alice we're serious, but still staying well below her asking price and within a reasonable distance from John's price.  This keeps the negotiation open while still aiming for a good deal."
