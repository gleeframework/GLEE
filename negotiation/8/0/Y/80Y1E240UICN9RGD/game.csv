,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you can't refuse. ",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
