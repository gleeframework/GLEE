"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $18,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I'm looking for, but still reasonable for you. How about $14,000 for the product?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm confident that we can find a solution that benefits both of us. I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product.  Let's work together to reach a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $13,500 for the product?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair offer that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $13,750 for the product?",13750.0,Alice,7,
