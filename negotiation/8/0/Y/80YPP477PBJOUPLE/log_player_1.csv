Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run.  I'm willing to make this deal happen for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, it allows some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Secure a Quick Sale:**  Offering a price significantly below Bob's valuation increases the chance he'll accept immediately, avoiding the need to go to John.

By starting high, I increase my chances of securing a higher profit while still ensuring the sale."
