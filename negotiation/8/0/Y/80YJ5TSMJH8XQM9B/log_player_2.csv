You're still trying to save as much money as possible.  $130 is still a bit higher than your max, but you can likely get it lower with another counteroffer."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $127. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at that price.

While Alice has come down in price, it's still more than your maximum budget. You're better off buying from John for $120 to ensure you get the best deal."
