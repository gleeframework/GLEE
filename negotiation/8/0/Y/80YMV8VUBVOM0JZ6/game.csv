"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $900,000 for your product, as I know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  $950,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. It's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
