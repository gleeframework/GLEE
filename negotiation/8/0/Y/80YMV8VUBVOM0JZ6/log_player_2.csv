"Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can likely get a better price than $1,200,000."

It's still worth trying to negotiate further. You can likely get the price down a bit more."

While you could continue negotiating, at this point it's probably better to accept Alice's offer. You're getting a good deal at $940,000, saving $60,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation could take more time and might not result in a significantly lower price."
