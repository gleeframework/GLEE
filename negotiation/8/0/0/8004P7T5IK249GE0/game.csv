"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $10,500? I'm eager to make this deal happen.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to bump up your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you the product for $11,250. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,7,
