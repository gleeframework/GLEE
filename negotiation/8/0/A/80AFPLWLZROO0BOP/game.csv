"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that meets you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value the product brings to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
