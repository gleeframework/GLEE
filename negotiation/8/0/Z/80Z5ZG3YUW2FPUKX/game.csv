"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll find this a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my target profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my target profit.",800000.0,Alice,5,
