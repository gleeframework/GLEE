"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering the value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price given my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value to you is $8,000.",10500.0,Alice,5,
