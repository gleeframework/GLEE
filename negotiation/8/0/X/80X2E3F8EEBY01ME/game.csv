,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be open to $85?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $95, but I'm willing to go to $90.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good investment for me.",90.0,Bob,4,
