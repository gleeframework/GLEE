"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to get a good deal. However, $7,000 is just too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is still too far off for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're serious about buying it, we need to find a solution that works for both of us. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
