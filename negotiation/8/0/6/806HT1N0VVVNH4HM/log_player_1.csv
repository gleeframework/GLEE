"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,085,000. I hope we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. It's worth pushing a little further to see if we can get closer to $1.1 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen - how about $1,100,000? That's my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what you're getting."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,090,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently moving upward and we are now at $90,000 above John's offer. Accepting at $1,090,000 secures a very strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiations stalling."
