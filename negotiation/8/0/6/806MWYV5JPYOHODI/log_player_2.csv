"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is worth a great deal to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's still very attractive. I understand its value to you is $1,500,000, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $1,400,000. It's a significant discount for you, and it allows me to secure a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm interested in saving as much money as I can, so I'll reject Alice's offer since it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000).
