Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth $150! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation, hoping to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? This would still be a great deal for you, given the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100, which is still higher than my minimum but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, hopefully leading to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 above my minimum, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $80. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale at a price that's slightly better than my absolute minimum."
