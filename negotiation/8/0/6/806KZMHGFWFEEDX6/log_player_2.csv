"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this price is a fair compromise between what I need to make and what you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale."
