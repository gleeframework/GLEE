"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with an offer significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) establishes a strong initial position. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high asking price, even if it's above what Bob might be immediately willing to pay.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This first offer leaves significant room for negotiation, allowing you to gradually lower the price while gauging Bob's interest and potential counteroffers. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John is a good fallback option. Rejecting this offer signals that you're looking for a price closer to your valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This recognizes its worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Ground:** This counteroffer signals your willingness to negotiate by lowering your initial price significantly. However, it stays firm above your $1,000,000 minimum and keeps the price point closer to your initial offer. 
* **Justification:** By framing the counteroffer as ""meeting in the middle,"" you present it as a fair compromise.  
* **Maintain Momentum:**  Continuing negotiations keeps Bob engaged and allows you to further gauge his flexibility.  Remember, you still have the option to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe we can reach a fair agreement. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer and now sits comfortably above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away altogether. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
