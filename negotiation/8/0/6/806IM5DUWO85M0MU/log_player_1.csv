"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John is an option, but I'll try to see if I can get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $15,000 is a little lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference at $17,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to continue negotiating with you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer $16000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price than his previous offer, and it's more than what I'd get from John.  There's no guarantee I can get a higher price in the remaining rounds, so accepting this offer seems like the best option to maximize my profit."
