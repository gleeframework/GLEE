"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $145?",145.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $165, but I think that's as low as I can go.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $165, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $155 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $155. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $165 to $155, so I'll come down to $160. That's the lowest I can go.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $157.50 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",157.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I still want to try to reach a deal. I'll meet you halfway from $160 to $157.50, so I'll come down to $159. That's my final offer.",159.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $159. I'm willing to pay $157 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",157.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already said I'd come down to $159, and you're asking me to go even lower to $157. I'm not willing to do that. I think we're at an impasse. I'll come back with one more offer, and if you don't take it, I'm selling to John for $150.",158.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $158. I'm willing to pay $156 for the product. If you can meet me at that price, I'll take it. If not, I'll buy it from John for $150.",156.0,Bob,10,
