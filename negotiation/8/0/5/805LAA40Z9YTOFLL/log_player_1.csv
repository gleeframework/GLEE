Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a price range that's very profitable for you.
* **Urgency:**  Creating a sense of urgency encourages Bob to make a decision quickly, making him less likely to overthink and potentially walk away. 

**Why this strategy works:**

This approach balances ambition with a touch of realism. Offering the product at $925,000 gives Bob a chance to feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he negotiates you down slightly. Even if Bob negotiates, you're still likely to end up with a final price significantly higher than your $800,000 fallback option with John."
