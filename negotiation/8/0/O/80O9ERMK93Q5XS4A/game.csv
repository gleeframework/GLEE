"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $115. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $115. I understand it's a bit higher than what you're comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $115.  It's fair for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer of $115, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $122. This is my final offer. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,5,
