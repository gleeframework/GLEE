"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a quick deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $115 gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging to increase Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Not High Enough:** $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation:** I want to keep negotiating and see if I can get a higher price. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to decline Bob's offer and see if he'll increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a good price, I need to get at least $110 for this product. Would you be willing to go that high?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up:** I'm increasing the price slightly, showing Bob I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Fairness:** I'm trying to frame the price as fair, considering the value of the product.
* **Leaving Room:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, so there's room for more negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5

* **Time is on my side:** I still have 6 rounds left, so I can afford to decline and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  This is a fair price, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway, showing good faith and demonstrating a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Increased Offer:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $108. I'm very close to accepting, but I need to get at least $108.50 for this product. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 108.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm making a small increase to my offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating that the deal is good for both of us.
* **Close to Acceptance:** I'm indicating that I'm close to accepting, putting pressure on Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to walking away, but I'll make one more offer. I'll meet you at $107.50, but that's my final offer. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** I only have 2 rounds left. 
* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, and there's a high chance he will walk away.
* **John's offer is better:**  I can sell to John for $120, which is above my minimum acceptable price and a much better deal than Bob's final offer. 

With only two rounds left, it's too risky to continue negotiating with Bob.  John's offer is a guaranteed sale at a more favorable price, so I'm going to take it."
