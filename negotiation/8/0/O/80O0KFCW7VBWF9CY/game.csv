"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a good price, I need to get at least $110 for this product. Would you be willing to go that high?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  This is a fair price, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $108. I'm very close to accepting, but I need to get at least $108.50 for this product. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you say?",108.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to walking away, but I'll make one more offer. I'll meet you at $107.50, but that's my final offer. Can you accept that?",107.5,Bob,8,
