Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob pushes back, but ensures you're still significantly above his perceived value.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value (""unique value proposition"", ""potential benefits"") without revealing specifics that Bob could use in a counter-offer.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase the product."
