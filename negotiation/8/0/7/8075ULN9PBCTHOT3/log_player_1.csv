Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value as possible, maximizing her potential profit.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high price ($11,999) sets an anchor point in Bob's mind. While it's unlikely he'll accept this initial offer, it creates room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't have to go below her minimum price of $12,000. This knowledge empowers her to be firm with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her price during the negotiation process."
