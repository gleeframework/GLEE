"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I would like to suggest a price closer to $800,000 for your product. This would allow me to make the purchase without straining my finances too much.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I can still get a reasonable return on my investment. I'm offering you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can close this now.",900000.0,Alice,3,
