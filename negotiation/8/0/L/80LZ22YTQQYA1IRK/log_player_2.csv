"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's no reason to accept $100 right away when you can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a 20% discount is a good strategy. It's a significant offer, but not so low that it's immediately insulting.  Alice might accept it, and if not, it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not the best price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**  Since Alice has already come down from $100 to $95, it's reasonable to assume she's willing to negotiate further. This offer is a compromise, meeting her halfway from the previous round. It signals you're serious about buying but still want a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to the target price, but it's still worth trying to push for a lower price. Alice is showing flexibility, so there's a good chance she might come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has clearly moved closer to your desired price. This counteroffer is a small step closer to the middle ground, showing a willingness to meet halfway while still aiming for a lower price. It keeps the pressure on Alice without making the offer too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is now only $2 away from your target price. It's not a significant difference, and continuing to negotiate might risk her walking away or raising the price again.  At this point, accepting the offer and getting the product for $92 is the best strategy to save money."
