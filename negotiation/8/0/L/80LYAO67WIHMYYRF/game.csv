"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $80? This aligns better with my financial planning.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to accept $80 for the item. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $85?",85.0,Alice,3,
