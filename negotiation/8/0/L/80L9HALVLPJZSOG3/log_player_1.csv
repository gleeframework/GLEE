Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you can afford to start higher with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept outright if he perceives the value as higher.
* **Not being overly aggressive:**  While I could start even higher, a price of $10,000 feels reasonable given it's only a 25% markup on its value to both of you. It avoids potentially turning Bob off with an offer that seems outlandish.
* **Highlighting value:** The message briefly hints at the product's value, encouraging Bob to consider its worth to him."
