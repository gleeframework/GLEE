Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth $100 to you, and to ensure a smooth transaction, I'm willing to offer it at the price of $120.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) leaves room for negotiation.  It also establishes the product's potential worth in Bob's mind. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** If Bob counters, you can always negotiate down towards his $100 valuation while still aiming for a profit. 

**Important:** This offer assumes you're comfortable with a potential rejection from Bob. If you want to ensure a sale, offering it at $100 would be the safest approach."
