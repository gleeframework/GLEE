"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $8,000. It's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
