"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob. I'm hoping he'll see some value in it and negotiate from there.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind my floor price of $15,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's not worth it to me to sell for that price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm still significantly above his offer, but I'm willing to negotiate.  If he rejects this, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price.  While $9,000 isn't ideal, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer, and I'm confident I can make up the difference in other ways. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
