"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price, but one that still leaves some room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $8,000, I'm aiming for a price that's above his valuation but still allows for potential compromise.  This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate while ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob. I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $13,000 to $11,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still holds a price that's closer to my desired amount. I believe this is a fair counteroffer that could lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm still confident I can get a better deal with Bob, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm now offering a price of $10,500. This shows Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's more beneficial to me. It's a slight compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility, while still being above Bob's latest offer. I believe this could be the sweet spot for us both to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm running out of time and John is a sure thing.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob for another round, but if he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm offering a price of $10,250. This is my final offer to Bob.  I'm making one last attempt to reach a deal before I sell to John. I'm hoping that this small compromise will be enough to convince Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've run out of time and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've tried my best to negotiate with Bob, but I need to secure the sale.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000 to guarantee a good profit and avoid further delays."
