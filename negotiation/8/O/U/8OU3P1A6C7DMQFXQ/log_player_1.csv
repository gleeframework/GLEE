Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a sense that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum and I'm confident I can get a better price from him in the future. However, at this point, it's better to accept his offer and secure the sale.  I can always try to negotiate a higher price for future transactions."
