"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1050000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed your proposal and would like to counter with an offer of $1075000 for the product. I believe this price is reasonable for both parties and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1075000 still doesn't meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product for $1090000. This is a very reasonable price considering its value to you. Let's try to find a middle ground and close this deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal and am willing to agree on a price of $1085000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our positions and would allow us to conclude this transaction.",1085000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1085000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm ready to close this deal if you're willing to meet me at $1095000.  That's only $5000 from your last offer, and it would be a very fair price for both of us.  Let's get this done!",1095000.0,Alice,7,
