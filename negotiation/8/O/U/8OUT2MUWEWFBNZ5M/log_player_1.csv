"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can still secure a better deal with Bob or fall back on John's offer if needed."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed your proposal and would like to counter with an offer of $1075000 for the product. I believe this price is reasonable for both parties and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below $1,000,000.  I've only had 4 rounds, and I can potentially still get a better price with Bob.  Furthermore, if I accept Bob's offer, I am only making $75,000 more than if I sold to John, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than that in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 still doesn't meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product for $1,090,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal and am willing to agree on a price of $1085000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our positions and would allow us to conclude this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still only $85,000 above John's offer. With 4 rounds remaining, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,085,000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm ready to close this deal if you're willing to meet me at $1,095,000.  That's only $5,000 from your last offer, and it would be a very fair price for both of us.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 1095000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued efforts in negotiating. I am prepared to offer $1090000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both parties and brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 2 rounds left, Bob's offer is now $90,000 above John's offer. It's a significant improvement and is approaching my desired price. It's more profitable than selling to John, and I'm confident that I can't secure a better price in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice."
