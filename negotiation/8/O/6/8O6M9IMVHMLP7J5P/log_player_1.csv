Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $16,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have room to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $16,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a significant profit. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is structured to be open to discussion. This allows you to understand Bob's level of interest and adjust your approach if needed. 

**Important:** This is just an initial offer. How you proceed will depend on Bob's response and your negotiation strategy."
