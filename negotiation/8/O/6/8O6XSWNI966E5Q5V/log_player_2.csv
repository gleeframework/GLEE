# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a great deal to you.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your operations. I'm asking for $1,400,000 for it.  This is a price that allows for a good profit margin for me, while still offering you a significant return on your investment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
