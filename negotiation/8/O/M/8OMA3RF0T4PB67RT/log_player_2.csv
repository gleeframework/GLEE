"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. After careful consideration, I believe it's only fair to extend this offer considering its significance and your potential appreciation for it. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This price reflects a balance between acknowledging the product's worth to me and providing you with a reasonable opportunity to own something that could be incredibly valuable to you. I trust that this offer will be favorable to both parties and look forward to discussing the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and purchasing from John for $1,200,000 is the most financially advantageous decision."
