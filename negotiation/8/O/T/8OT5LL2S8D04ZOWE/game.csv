"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000?  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm still not quite at your price point, but I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000.  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles. We're so close, but we need to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, I can't go any lower.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
