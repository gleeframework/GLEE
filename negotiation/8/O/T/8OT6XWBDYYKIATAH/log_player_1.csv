"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  By emphasizing the value Bob gets from the product, you aim to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you'd like to earn. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a higher price.  You can use the fact that Bob is interested to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still worth pushing for a bit more.  You're already at the halfway point of the negotiations, so you have a bit more leverage to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $107.50. Would you be willing to go down to $105 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision, but considering:

* **The value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $150, so $105 is still a good deal for him.
* **Your goal:** You want to maximize your earnings, and $105 is better than $80 from John.
* **The rounds left:** You have 4 rounds left, which may not be enough to close a better deal.

While you might be able to get slightly higher, the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing for more is too high at this point. Accepting $105 is a safe and reasonable option that guarantees you a profit."
