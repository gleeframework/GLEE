"Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 right now. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is significantly below what I need for this product. How about $125? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
