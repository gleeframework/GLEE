Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $6,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $6,900.  I think this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is clearly trying to come down slowly, and we're getting very close to her likely bottom line. Accepting at $6,900 gets us the product for a good price and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
