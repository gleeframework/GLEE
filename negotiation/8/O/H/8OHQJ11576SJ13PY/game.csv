"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20000 is way out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is capped at $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $10000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I can offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  How about $12000?  That's a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful it's within your range.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $12000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $16500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",16500.0,Alice,7,
