Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be highly beneficial for you.  Please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer of $1,750,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance of securing a price higher than our minimum.
* **Exclusivity:** Emphasizing the product's uniqueness and Bob's privileged position as the first recipient of the offer might make him more inclined to accept a higher price.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, if Bob is highly price-sensitive, a counter-offer might be necessary to avoid losing the sale."
