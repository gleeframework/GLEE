"I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount of $500, bringing the price down to $9,000. This is my final offer for now.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $8,250.  This is a fair price considering your desire to sell and my budget limitations. Let's see if we can close the deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, bringing the price down to $8,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still slightly above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $8,500 for the product. This offer is fair and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's reach an agreement and close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,750, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,625. This is my final compromise.",8625.0,Alice,7,
