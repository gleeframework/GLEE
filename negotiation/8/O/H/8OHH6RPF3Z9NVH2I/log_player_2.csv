"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that I know will be extremely valuable to your business.  I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a substantial profit for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd save $200,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **You still get a good deal.**  Even at $1,000,000, you're getting the product for $200,000 less than what it's worth to you."
