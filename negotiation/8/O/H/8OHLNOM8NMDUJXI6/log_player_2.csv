Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's value to you, while still being reasonable for me. How about $920000? I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the benefits the product will bring you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $910000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This price is already a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to consider this as my final offer, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $910,000 is still within my budget and is getting closer to my desired price.  It's risky to reject this offer and risk losing the deal altogether. While I might be able to negotiate further, I'm not sure if it's worth the risk, considering the time constraint and John's price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price within my budget."
