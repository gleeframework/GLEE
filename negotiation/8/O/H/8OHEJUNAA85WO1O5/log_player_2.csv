"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,400,000, which is higher than the product's value to you ($1,200,000). 
* You have a better option: John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, but you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so there's potential for negotiation with John.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with John."
