"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
