Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you do $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice. Could we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a price I'd find acceptable, I'm not confident he'll go much higher than $100. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a lower offer. John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a fair deal for me."
