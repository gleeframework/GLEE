"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate down from this price.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,000 is still a good deal for me, especially considering the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal altogether. 

It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000, but at this point, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to maximize my profit and avoid further risk."
