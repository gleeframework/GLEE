"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your budget. You want to negotiate and see if you can get a better price. It's too early to buy from John, as you haven't fully explored the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? That's my maximum budget, but I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This still leaves some room for profit for me and gets us closer to your budget.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice down even further.  There are still several rounds left, and you have the option to buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Let's split the difference. How about $11,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
