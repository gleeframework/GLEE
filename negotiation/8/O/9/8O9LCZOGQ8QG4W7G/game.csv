"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,000. How about $9,750? That's my final offer.",9750.0,Bob,6,
