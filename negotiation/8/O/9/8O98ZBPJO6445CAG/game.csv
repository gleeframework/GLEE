"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than $100. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $110, but I'm still thinking $130 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
