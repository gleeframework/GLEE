"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer of $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $150 is far above Bob's maximum price of $100.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above what he's willing to pay. He can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no guarantee that Alice will keep lowering her price, but the possibility of getting a better deal outweighs the risk of paying a little more later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $110, but I'm still thinking $130 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is clearly not going to budge much further. Bob has tried to negotiate down from $150 to $110, but Alice is now asking for $130. There are only 5 rounds left, and Bob is running out of time.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $100, as he's guaranteed to get it for his maximum price."
