"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $1025000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
