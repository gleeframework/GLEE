"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $800,000 for it to make sense.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 still feels high. I can do $900,000. That's a significant investment, and I need to be mindful of my budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute floor. I believe this offer represents a fair deal considering the product's true worth.  What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, anything over $1,000,000 is pushing my limit. I can offer $950,000. That's my final offer.  If it doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
