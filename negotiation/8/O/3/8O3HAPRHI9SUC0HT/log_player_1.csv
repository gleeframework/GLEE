Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $800,000 for it to make sense.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, anything over $1,000,000 is pushing my limit. I can offer $950,000. That's my final offer.  If it doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet Alice's minimum price.  He's incrementally increasing his offer, but at this rate, it's unlikely he'll reach a number acceptable to Alice within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees Alice her minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
