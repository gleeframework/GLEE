"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To kickstart our negotiation, I propose a starting price of $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting with a high price of $1,800,000 (significantly above both our valuations) establishes a strong position and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This aggressive offer will help gauge Bob's eagerness and provide insights into his perceived value of the product.
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup buyer willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing us to confidently negotiate for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than your initial offer. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably less than our target and less than what we know the product is worth to him. We have room to negotiate and leverage our position.  We'll aim to bring him closer to our desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I'm confident we can find common ground.  Considering the true value and potential of this product, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000.  This reflects a significant reduction on my initial offer and provides a win-win scenario for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We reduced our price by $200,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Highlighting Value:** We re-emphasize the product's inherent value to keep Bob focused on its worth beyond just the price.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to move closer to our desired range, aiming for a compromise above the $1,400,000 midpoint."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at the exact midpoint between our initial offers. While $1,400,000 is tempting, we're still in a strong negotiating position. We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, and we have John as a backup. We'll push a bit further in the next round to see if we can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of this one-of-a-kind product."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're making a smaller concession this time ($100,000), signaling that we're reaching our limit.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,500,000 is a strong price, well above our minimum and a significant gain for us. It leaves Bob with a tough but hopefully appealing choice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,500,000, which is $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** We successfully moved Bob significantly closer to our desired price range.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller and smaller increments, with a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Profitable Deal:** $1,450,000 is a substantial profit, far exceeding our minimum and John's offer. It's a win for us."
