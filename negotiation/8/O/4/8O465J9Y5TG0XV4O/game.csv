"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is around $15,000, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is my absolute top price, and I'm confident it's a fair offer considering the value to both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your top price. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the discount I'm offering. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $10,000. This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can both benefit from this deal. If you're not willing to accept that price, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
