"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is around $15,000, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's a discount from the market value, it's still too high. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your top price. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the discount I'm offering. What do you think?
