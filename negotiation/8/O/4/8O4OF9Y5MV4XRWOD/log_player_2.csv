"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Your value:** The product is worth $100 to you, which means you're willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Alice's value:** Alice is willing to sell for $80, but she's offering $90.
* **John's price:** You can get the product for $100 from John.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can buy the product from John for $100, which is within your budget and still saves you $10 compared to Alice's offer."
