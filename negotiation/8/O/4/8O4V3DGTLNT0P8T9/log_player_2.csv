"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can still do better. He knows he can get the product for $12,000 from John, so he should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the $12,000 price from John, so he'll start by offering a price slightly higher than that, hoping to find a middle ground with Alice. This counteroffer demonstrates his serious intent to buy while still being within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget, and it's closer to his ideal price of $12,000. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his next counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John at $12,000. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids potential delays or a less favorable outcome."
