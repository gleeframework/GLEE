"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140, as it's a reasonable starting point that gives me some room to negotiate if needed.  However, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $120 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $120.  While I want to make as much money as possible, I'm not willing to accept a loss. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $130, which is still above my minimum of $120. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering Bob's previous offer.  Hopefully, this will lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $120.  I'm not willing to accept a loss, so I'll reject his offer and try again to reach a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm dropping the price to $125, which is still above my minimum and a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly above my minimum price of $120.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a good deal considering we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I'm also aware that if I reject this offer, I could potentially lose the deal and be forced to sell to John for $120. So, I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
