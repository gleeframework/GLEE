Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, but going lower increases the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price slightly higher than $130.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. It's better to secure a sale with Bob at a slightly lower price than risk no sale at all."
