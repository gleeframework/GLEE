"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is too far below my minimum price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? I believe this is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $8,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $7,000 is still a significant gap for me. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop to $7,500.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",7500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  I'm willing to bump my offer slightly to $7,200.  Do you think that would work?",7200.0,Bob,6,
