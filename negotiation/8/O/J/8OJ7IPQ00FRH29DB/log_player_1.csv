{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $1,250,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm, highlighting the value of the product for Bob.

**Strategy:**

* This offer sets the negotiation in motion without being too aggressive. 
* If Bob rejects, I can adjust the offer based on his counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my desired $1,500,000. 
* Having the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 provides a safety net and limits my risk during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1250000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my desired price of $1,500,000 and even below his own perceived value of $1,000,000.  
* Accepting his offer would be a significant loss for me.

**Strategy:**

* I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. 
* I will aim for a price closer to my desired $1,500,000 while still being open to negotiation. 
* By rejecting the initial counteroffer, I demonstrate my commitment to securing a fair price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value you see in this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000? This leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $1,050,000 is a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired price. It's above his initial offer but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's perspective while emphasizing the product's value. I frame the counteroffer as a ""meet in the middle"" scenario to encourage a positive response.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while ensuring I don't make too many concessions too early.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to adjust my offer further based on Bob's response.
* **Safety Net:**  The option to sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage and allows me to walk away if Bob remains unwilling to meet my terms."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too far below the value of this product.  To demonstrate my commitment to a fair deal, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a price that benefits both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $1,000,000 is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still well above Bob's latest proposal.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's efforts while emphasizing that this is my final offer. I highlight the value of the product and the benefit for both of us.
* **Strategy:**
    * **Pressure:** This final offer creates pressure on Bob to accept, as further negotiation could lead to the deal falling through.
    * **Balance:** It maintains a balance between securing a good price and potentially losing the deal if Bob walks away.
    * **Safety Net:** I can still walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob refuses.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet at a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $975,000 is still too low, and I've already made significant concessions.
* Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to lead to a price closer to my desired $1,500,000. 
* Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees the best possible outcome for me.

**Strategy:**

* This decision maximizes my profit by securing the highest price available.
* It avoids further negotiation and potential concessions that could lead to a lower price.
* It demonstrates a willingness to walk away from a deal when it's not in my best interest."
