"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1250000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value you see in this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1050000? This leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $950000 is still too far below the value of this product.  To demonstrate my commitment to a fair deal, I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a price that benefits both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
