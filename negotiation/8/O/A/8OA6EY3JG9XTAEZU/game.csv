"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you as it's more than what I can get elsewhere.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still gives us both a fair price. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant step closer to my budget and a good deal for you, considering you're still getting more than what I can get from someone else.",10000.0,Bob,4,
