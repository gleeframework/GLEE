"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, however, I believe your starting price is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $760,000?  I feel that's a fair offer reflecting the value it holds for me.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer a price of $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Alice,5,
