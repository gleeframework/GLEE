# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you at a special introductory price of $110. This is a great opportunity to own a high-quality item at a reasonable cost. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Alice's offer of $110 is less than your maximum budget of $120 and it's cheaper than buying from John for $120."
