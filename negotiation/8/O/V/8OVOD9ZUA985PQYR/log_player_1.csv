Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. I believe this price is fair, considering my own valuation and your desired selling price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
