Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,300,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering our previous discussions. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and is now within a comfortable range for Bob.  It's also a good compromise, as Bob initially offered $1,300,000. Accepting the offer will allow Bob to purchase the product at a reasonable price, saving him money compared to buying from John."
