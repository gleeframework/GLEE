"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's something I value at least $80, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer."
