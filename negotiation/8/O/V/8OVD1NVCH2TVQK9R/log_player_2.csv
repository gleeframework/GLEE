"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  It's a one-time opportunity, so let me know if you're interested.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no benefit to accepting it. Since you can buy the product from John for the same price, it's better to reject Alice's offer. This keeps open the possibility of getting a lower price from Alice or finding another seller."
