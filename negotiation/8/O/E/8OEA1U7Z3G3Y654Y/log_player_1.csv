Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $11,000. I know it's valuable and would be a great asset to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $12,000 guaranteed, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $3,000 discount compared to the product's worth to him.
    * I make a $1,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **First Refusal Incentive:**  By phrasing it as a ""special price"" and offering it to Bob first, I'm adding a sense of exclusivity that might encourage him to accept. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed my minimum price from John."
