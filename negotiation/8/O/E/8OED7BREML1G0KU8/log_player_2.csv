{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. I want to see if I can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiating and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $125.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $125, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $137.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price point, but I'm still not at my ideal price.  I'll continue to negotiate to see if I can bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $137.50 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $130. Let's split the difference, and see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $132, which is closer to your target of $130. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $132 is very close to my ideal price of $130.  Since I'm only two rounds away from my maximum limit with John, it's worth accepting this offer to avoid the risk of losing the product and being forced to pay John's higher price."
