Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that it's worth a premium price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but suggests a discussion is welcome.  Phrases like ""proposing a price"" and ""What do you think?"" invite Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might lower your initial offer slightly. 
* **Market Demand:** If the product is in high demand, you can be more confident in a higher asking price.

This initial offer aims to maximize your potential profit while still leaving room for a deal that's acceptable to Bob."
