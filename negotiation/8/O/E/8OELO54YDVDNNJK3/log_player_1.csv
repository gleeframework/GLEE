Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point since the product is worth $150 to Bob.  I want to maximize my profit while leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than $120 from John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price of $140.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like a little more, $132 is a good price. It's significantly better than selling to John, and further negotiation might take too long and risk Bob walking away entirely."
