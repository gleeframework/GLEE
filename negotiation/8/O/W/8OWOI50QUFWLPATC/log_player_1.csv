Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit above my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also  high enough to potentially make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, which could make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my original asking price.  I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $90?  This gives you a great deal and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit lower than $90. How about $85? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum price and a better deal than selling to John. It's also a sign he's willing to negotiate and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
