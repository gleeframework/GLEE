Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $12,000 as my offer price. This is a compromise between my minimum desired price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value of the product for Bob. This can help sway him towards accepting the offer.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:** $12,000 is higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me a good profit.
* **Minimizes risk:** It's still lower than my minimum desired price, but I'm confident I can get $15,000 from John if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Balances persuasion and negotiation:** The message is positive and encouraging, without being too aggressive or demanding.

Remember, the key is to find a price point that both satisfies your financial goals and presents a compelling offer for Bob."
