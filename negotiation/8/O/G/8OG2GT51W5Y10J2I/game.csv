"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, $9500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9000 is simply too low for me.  Let's try $9750. This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
