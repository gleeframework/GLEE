"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value our potential partnership, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, considering your interest and the value of the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,025,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
