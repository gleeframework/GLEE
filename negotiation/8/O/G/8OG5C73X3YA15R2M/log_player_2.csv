"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum price and what John is offering. There's a lot of room for negotiation. By rejecting and countering, you can try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  By providing a number, you show you're serious but also establish a position that's more advantageous to you. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value our potential partnership, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, considering your interest and the value of the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice reduced her price, but it's still $100,000 more than what John offers. While there's a risk Alice might not go much lower, it's worth countering one more time. You can try to meet closer to the middle ground between your last offer and her current one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($1,100,000) and your previous offer ($800,000). 
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is concise and directly proposes a compromise price.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By aiming for a fair compromise, it might encourage Alice to accept and avoid further back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,025,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,025,000. While you could continue negotiating, the potential savings are relatively small now ($25,000). It's not worth the risk of Alice refusing to negotiate further and potentially losing out on the product altogether. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the safer and more financially sound decision at this point."
