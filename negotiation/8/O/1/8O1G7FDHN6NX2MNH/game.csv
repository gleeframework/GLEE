"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? That would be a fair deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
