Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $13,000."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Round 3

Round 4
