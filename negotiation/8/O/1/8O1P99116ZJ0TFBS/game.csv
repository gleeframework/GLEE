"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.  Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $140 for the product.  If this isn't acceptable, I'm going to have to go with another seller.",140.0,Bob,4,
