Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a more substantial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,100,000 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.

While $1,150,000 is getting closer, I'm still not at my desired price point. I'm going to make one final counteroffer to Bob before considering selling to John."

I've reached my limit with Bob's offers. While he's shown some willingness to negotiate, he's still not meeting my minimum price. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,200,000, so I'm going to sell the product to John."
