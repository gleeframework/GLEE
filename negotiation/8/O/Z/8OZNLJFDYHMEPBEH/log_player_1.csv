{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $9,500 is still above your minimum threshold of $10,000, meaning you'll still make a profit.
* **It's a strong opening:**  This offer shows you're confident in the product's value and are willing to negotiate, but not desperate.

It's important to remember that the negotiation is dynamic and you'll have to adapt your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try and secure a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should now make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider a price slightly above $8,500, but still below your minimum. This will show Bob that you're willing to compromise but also that you value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It's a compromise:**  $9,000 is a midpoint between your previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows a willingness to meet halfway.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $9,000 is above your minimum threshold of $10,000, ensuring you'll still make a profit. 
* **It's a clear message:** You're conveying that you're willing to negotiate but also that you believe the product is worth more than $8,500.

This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to reconsider and potentially come up on his price. If he rejects, you can evaluate whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $8,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is now below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  This means that selling to John for $10,000 is the most financially advantageous option. 

**Why not continue negotiating?**

While you could continue to negotiate with Bob, it's unlikely he'll increase his offer significantly. You've already made two counteroffers, and he's shown a reluctance to go above $8,000.  Continuing the negotiation risks wasting time and potentially getting a lower price than John's offer. 

**It's time to maximize your profit!**  Selling to John guarantees you $10,000, which is your minimum goal and a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
