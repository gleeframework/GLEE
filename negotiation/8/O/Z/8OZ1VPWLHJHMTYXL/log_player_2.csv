"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While Alice's offer is tempting, there's room for negotiation. Bob can aim for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $950,000? This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $1,025,000 is closer to his maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. He can try to push for a price closer to $1,000,000.  It's risky, but he can always fall back on John's offer if he has to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably offer right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. $1,050,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has to decide whether he's willing to risk further negotiation with Alice or go with John's guaranteed offer. 

Alice is firm at $1,050,000, and Bob is already at his maximum budget with John's offer.  While he could try to negotiate with Alice again, there's a strong chance she won't budge, and he could end up losing valuable rounds. 

By buying from John, Bob secures the product at his maximum budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation. It's a safe and efficient choice."
