"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $950,000? This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value it holds for you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably offer right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. $1,050,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
