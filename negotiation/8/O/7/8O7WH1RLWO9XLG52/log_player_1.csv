"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profits.  Bob knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, so this offer gives him room to negotiate and still come out ahead.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer down in subsequent rounds while still keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob.  He's already shown he's willing to pay more than his initial valuation, and I believe I can get a better price with more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while also maintaining a strong bargaining position. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I can continue adjusting my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with his offer.  I'm going to continue negotiating with him to see if I can reach a price closer to my desired $1,500,000. There are still 6 rounds remaining, so I have time to work with Bob and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm making another concession, but I'm still holding firm on my price.  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price and demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal and accept, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, and Bob still not willing to meet my minimum price, I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a deal with John now for $1,500,000, which guarantees I meet my minimum goal.  Even though I'd like to get closer to $1,800,000,  the risk of not finding a deal with Bob at all is too high."
