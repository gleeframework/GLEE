"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to my budget. How about $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. While I am comfortable spending up to $12,000 for this product, I would like to stick to my original offer. I am unable to increase my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While ideally, I'd like to get more for the product, Bob is firm on his valuation. Accepting his offer of $12,000 is the best choice at this point, as it matches what John is offering.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate and ultimately result in the same selling price."
