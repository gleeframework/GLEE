"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this.  While I'm interested, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product has a significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that's more in line with my budget.  I'd like to offer $725,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $735,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",735000.0,Alice,5,
