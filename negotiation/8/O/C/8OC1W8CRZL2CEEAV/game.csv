"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really like the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm really interested in buying it if we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me, as I'm sure you understand that this product is really special. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you think this product is special, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. If we can agree on that, I'll buy it right now. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,
