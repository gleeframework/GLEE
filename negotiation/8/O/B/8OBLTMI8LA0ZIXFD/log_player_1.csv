Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, our goal is to maximize profit.  Offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price could result in a quicker sale and still a good profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also creates the impression that we're offering a fair deal, potentially encouraging him to accept without pushing for a lower price.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message keeps the door open for negotiation, making Bob feel more in control and potentially leading to a mutually agreeable outcome. 

By setting the price at $14,000 and keeping the conversation open, we strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and ensuring a sale at our minimum acceptable price from John."
