Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested, but I'd need to see a price closer to $12,000 to make this work. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13000 is a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14500. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $14,500 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $14,000, I'm still hesitant to accept. I'm only willing to pay up to $12,000 for this product, and I'm not sure I can justify going higher, especially since I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for that price. I'm hopeful that with further negotiation, I can convince Alice to come down closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly value your willingness to compromise.  However, $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $13,000, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.  I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $13250. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $13,250 is still higher than my maximum budget of $12,000.  While I have been successful in lowering the price, it's clear that we're at an impasse. Rather than continuing to negotiate and risk potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John, I'm going to take the safe route and purchase the product from John at $12,000."
