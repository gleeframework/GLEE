You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than John's $1,000,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of the product ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing her to lower the price further."
