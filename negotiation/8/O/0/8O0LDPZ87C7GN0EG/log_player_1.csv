Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, knowing John is a guaranteed sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down, Alice is likely to get a price higher than $80.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it too close to Bob's perceived value ($80) might make Alice seem desperate to sell."
