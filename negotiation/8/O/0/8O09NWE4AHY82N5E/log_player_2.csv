"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still allows you to make a profit, while also giving me a fair return.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further. There are still 7 rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit and keeps this deal on track."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,025,000. This price is a good compromise for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit margin and me a fair return on my investment.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further. There are still 5 rounds left, and with the option to buy from John, Bob can still walk away from the deal with a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This price represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
