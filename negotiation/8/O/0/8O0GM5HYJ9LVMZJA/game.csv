"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I could consider a price of $1,500,000. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,500,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here, and $1,250,000 is getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000.  I believe this is a fair and final offer that reflects the true worth of this product.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
