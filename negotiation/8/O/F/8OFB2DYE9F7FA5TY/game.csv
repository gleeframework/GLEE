"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,350,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. Can we agree on that price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
