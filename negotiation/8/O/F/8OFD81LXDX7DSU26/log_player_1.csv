{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but one that's still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $875,000 is a good deal considering we're halfway through the negotiation rounds.  It's also significantly more than I'd get from John."
