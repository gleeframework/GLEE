Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while also leaving room for a possible counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price. Accepting his offer ensures I get at least my minimum value for the product, which is better than risking a continued negotiation that might end up lower or having to sell to John for the same price."
