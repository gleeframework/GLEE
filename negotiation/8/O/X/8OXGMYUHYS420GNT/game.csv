"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your product's value, but I believe I can't afford $11,000 at this time. Would you consider reducing the price to $9,500? I appreciate your understanding.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can accept.  What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still not able to meet the price of $10,250. Could we perhaps aim for $10,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
