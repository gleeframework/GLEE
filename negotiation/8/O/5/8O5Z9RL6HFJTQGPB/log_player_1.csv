Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible from Bob, knowing we have John as a backup.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's buying price ($950,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still landing us above his perceived value of $800,000.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring a sale, as we have the security of John's offer."
