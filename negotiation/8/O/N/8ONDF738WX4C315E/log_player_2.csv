Alice is getting closer, but we're still paying more than we need to if we go with John. One more counter-offer should do the trick."

It seems Alice is firm on her price of $125. At this point, we're better off cutting our losses and going with John who will sell it to us for $120.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation if we already have a better offer."
