Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. I think that's a fair price considering the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $120 was a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $125 is a decent profit margin over your minimum price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly interested and is willing to negotiate. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling.
* **Time Value:**  While you have more rounds, closing the deal sooner means you can move on to other potential sales."
