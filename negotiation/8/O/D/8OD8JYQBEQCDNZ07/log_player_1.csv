Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as it's important to get as much as possible.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but I'll always have the option to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm going to try to split the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This should hopefully make it more appealing to Bob while still getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is getting closer to Bob's valuation, it's still not enough for me.  I'm going to counter again, and if Bob rejects, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to go down a bit further, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm going to go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting too close to his own valuation, making it unlikely he'll increase his offer significantly.  I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get the maximum price."
