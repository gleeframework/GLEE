"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $14,000? ",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the value I place on the product, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
