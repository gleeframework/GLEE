Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it also sets a strong initial value for the product.  I'm aiming for a good profit while still leaving space for Bob to potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my ideal price, it's only $50,000 less than my last counteroffer and significantly higher than selling to John. It's time to close the deal and secure the profit."
