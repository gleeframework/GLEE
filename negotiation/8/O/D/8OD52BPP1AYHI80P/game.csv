"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product has potential, $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high.  Would you consider $1,100,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a win-win. How about  $1,175,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and keeps us moving towards a deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  To bridge the gap, I can offer $1,125,000.  This keeps us moving and shows I'm serious about reaching a deal today.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  To be frank, I have another buyer ready at $1,200,000. To close this deal today, I'd need you to meet that price. How about we make this our final exchange, and shake hands on it?",1200000.0,Alice,7,
