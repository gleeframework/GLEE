,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm not looking to break the bank. Can you meet me halfway?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go any lower than $85. Let's find a middle ground. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85. Can you consider $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $77.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $81.25?  Let's close this deal.",81.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $81.25 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $79, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",79.0,Bob,6,
