"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider it?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $155? This is already a good deal for you, given what the product is worth. ",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider it?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $130 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $142? This is a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny.",142.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $142 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $135. Can you consider it?",135.0,Bob,6,
