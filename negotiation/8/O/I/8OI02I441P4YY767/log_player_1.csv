Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product. I would like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand it's a significant amount, but I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $9,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I've considered your proposal, but I'd like to keep the price closer to my budget. Would $9500 be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price. While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely he won't budge much more.  It's better to secure the sale at $9,500 than to risk losing him completely and having to sell to John for a lower price."
