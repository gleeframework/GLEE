"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $10,000 is above his budget and he can get the product for less from John.  He has room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong negotiating tactic to show his seriousness about buying the product while also setting a clear price point he's willing to pay.  He's testing the waters and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for less from John. He can try to negotiate further with Alice and see if he can get her to lower the price even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he is willing to compromise. However, he is still well below Alice's latest offer and is trying to find a middle ground. He is also keeping his counteroffer below John's price, giving him a safety net if Alice refuses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $8,500 is close to his budget and even a bit lower than John's price, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. He has a few rounds left and could potentially convince her to come down to $8,000. He is also testing her willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob is finally offering Alice's asking price from John. This demonstrates his serious intent to buy the product while still having a backup option if Alice rejects.  He's testing if he can close the deal now or if further negotiation is needed."
