"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a strategic move to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. I believe the product is worth more than $8,000, so this initial offer reflects that value. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate downwards, but I want to start strong and see where it leads."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum threshold of $8,000.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but also that I believe the product is worth more than $7,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if I can push him a little higher in the next round. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not in a desperate position to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500.  This is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  It's getting late in the game, but I'm hoping this is a sweet spot where we can both reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one, but Bob has finally met my minimum.  It's getting late in the game, and if I reject this offer, I'm not sure I can do better.  Selling to John for $8,000 is a good backup, but I'm going to take this offer and secure the sale."
