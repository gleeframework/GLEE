"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your operations. I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. My starting price is $950,000. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and reducing the price to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially considering he values the product at $1,000,000.  I have several rounds left to negotiate, so rejecting his offer allows me to explore a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, it's not quite where I need to be. Considering the value this product brings,  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. Let's work together to bridge this gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price of $800,000, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I still have several rounds left and believe I can potentially secure a price closer to my ideal $900,000. Selling to John now would only yield $800,000, and I'm confident I can do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $825,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which reflects the significant value you will gain from this product.  This price is still well within your budget and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stuck at $825,000, and I've already come down from $900,000 to $875,000.  With only four rounds left, I don't see a chance of reaching my ideal price, and it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $800,000.  This secures me my minimum acceptable price and prevents risking a further reduction in the next round."
