"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15000 is my absolute minimum.  This product is worth a lot more, and I'm sure you'll agree once you have it.  Let's split the difference and settle on $16500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, so I'll counter with $14500. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $14500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to make a final concession.  Let's agree on $15500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make a final counteroffer of $14000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a great deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
