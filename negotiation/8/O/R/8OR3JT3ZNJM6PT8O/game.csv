"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my original asking price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise between our previous offers.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer of $7,500, but I'm not ready to give up on my original target price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $8,000, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",8000.0,Alice,5,
