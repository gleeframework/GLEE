Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum:** I won't sell for less than $8,000 as that's my own valuation. 
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so I can aim for a price closer to that.
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a price in the middle, giving Bob a good deal and me a good profit. 

If Bob rejects, I can still get my minimum from John."
