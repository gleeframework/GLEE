"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to compromise on the price too much. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $7,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,3,
