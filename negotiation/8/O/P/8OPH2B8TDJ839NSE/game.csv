"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I'm confident this product will deliver significant value, justifying this price point.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product to me is quite high. I could come down to $1,025,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe it's a fair reflection of what this product offers.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're firm on the price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $920,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal.",920000.0,Bob,6,
