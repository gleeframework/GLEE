"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this unique item, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $12000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to counteroffer at $14000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Can you consider my offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $14000. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $15500. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14500, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",14500.0,Bob,6,
