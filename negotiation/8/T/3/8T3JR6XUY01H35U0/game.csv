,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  This would be a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a bit too much for me. Let's try $92.50.  That's a good compromise and we can both move on. What do you say?",92.5,Bob,4,
