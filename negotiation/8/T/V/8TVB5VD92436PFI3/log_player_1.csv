Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to you, it implies that it's significant by mentioning a ""value."" 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything as you have John as a backup. If he counter-offers, you know he's seriously considering it. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price."
