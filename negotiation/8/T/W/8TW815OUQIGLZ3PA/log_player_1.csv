Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you want to start high to maximize your potential profit.
* **Just below your guaranteed price:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he doesn't take the deal.
* **Justification:**  While you don't want to reveal your bottom line, vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" might make the price more palatable. 
* **Alternative buyer pressure:**  Hinting at other interested parties could encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your offer. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still leaving you with a guaranteed sale."
