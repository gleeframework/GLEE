Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer and providing a counter-offer keeps the negotiation open with the potential to secure a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob.  I understand your position, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we settle at $135?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""worth more to me than that"" subtly communicates that you have a bottom line and are not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to keep costs down. Can we meet at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Margin, But Profitable:** While not ideal, $115 is still a profit over your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of Losing the Sale:**  Continuing to push for a higher price could make Bob lose interest altogether, leaving you to settle for John's offer of $100. 

Sometimes in negotiations, it's better to secure a smaller profit than to risk losing the sale entirely."
