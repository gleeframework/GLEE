Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $175."",
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $150. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 provides a safety net. 
* **Initial Offer Strategy:** Starting with a price of $175 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. If Bob accepts the $175, it's a profit above what John would pay."
