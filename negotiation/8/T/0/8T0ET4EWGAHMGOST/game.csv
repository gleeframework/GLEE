"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm open to offers, but I know it's worth at least $150 to me.  Would you be interested in buying it for $140?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's a good deal for both of us, and it still allows me to get closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $132.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $132.50 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to go down to $134 to make this work. That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to a deal, but $134 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $133, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",133.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go higher.  However, $133 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference: $133.50. This is a fair compromise that allows us to close the deal.  I'm confident you'll agree that it's a good price for both of us.",133.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $133, and I think that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $133. Can we finalize the deal at that price?",133.0,Bob,8,
