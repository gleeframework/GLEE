"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $950,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  While $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to move down to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of this product and what it can bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
