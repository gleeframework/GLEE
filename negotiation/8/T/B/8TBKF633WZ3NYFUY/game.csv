"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be around $80 to you. To make this deal attractive for both of us, I propose selling it to you for $100. This way, you save some money compared to its lesser perceived value, and I get a fair return for my investment. What do you think about this offer?",100.0,Alice,1,
