"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is still significantly above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000), allowing us to potentially meet Bob somewhere in the middle.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing mutual benefit and a collaborative negotiation approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a tempting offer, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's initial counteroffer being so far below his stated value suggests there's room to push for a better price. We'll counteroffer strategically to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential for your business.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession ($50,000) to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  
* **Holding Firm:** We're not meeting Bob halfway just yet. Our new offer keeps the price well above our minimum while still within a reasonable range for Bob. 
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating the value proposition to remind Bob of the potential benefits and justify the higher price. 
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:**  By stating our willingness to compromise, we encourage Bob to reciprocate and move closer to our target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $975,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently meeting us halfway, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, we're still a fair distance from our desired outcome.  We need to show firmness to avoid settling too low while still demonstrating some flexibility. We'll counteroffer again with a smaller concession to steer the negotiation upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've given this more thought, and to demonstrate my commitment to finding an agreement, I'm now willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price that reflects the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  We're reducing our concession to $25,000, signaling that we're nearing our bottom line while still demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Firm but Fair Language:**  The language emphasizes fairness and value, reiterating the product's worth without being overly aggressive. 
* **No Further Justification:** We've already justified the price adequately. Now, we're letting the smaller concession speak for itself and putting the ball back in Bob's court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and propose $950,000. I believe this is the maximum I can go without going over my budget. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $950,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($800,000). 
* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his maximum budget. Pushing further is likely to result in a stalemate or losing the deal.
* **Time Value:** We've secured a very good price without exhausting too many rounds, minimizing the risk of losing the deal to other factors. 
* **""Bird in Hand"":** Accepting a strong offer now is generally preferable to risking a less favorable outcome by continuing to negotiate."
