Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I need at least $150, offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to get more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a price that's likely attractive to Bob (as it's more than his perceived value) while still providing me a profit margin.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects, I'm covered with John's offer at $150."
