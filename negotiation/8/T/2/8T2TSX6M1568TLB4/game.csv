"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the value I believe it's worth to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from it.  I believe this is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I still think $900,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise and allows us to find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
