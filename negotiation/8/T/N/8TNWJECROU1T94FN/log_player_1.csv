"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $120 and leaves room for negotiation.  I think Bob will be willing to pay a little more than my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to his value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm counter-offering with $135. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it will be enough to get the deal done."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm counter-offering with $130 again. This is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's latest offer, and I think it's a fair price. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to get a deal done soon!"

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's only slightly above my minimum, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal.  It's better to get $122 than $120 from John."
