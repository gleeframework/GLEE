"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going to John as we won't get a better deal."
