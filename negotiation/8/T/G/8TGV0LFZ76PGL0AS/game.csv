I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?,1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1200000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Is this more in line with what you're looking for?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go up to $950000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I can see that you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, which is a compromise that's closer to my initial offer. Is this a price you're willing to pay?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
