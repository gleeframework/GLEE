I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a significant profit for me. It also demonstrates my confidence in the value of the product.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in acquiring it at this price, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves me with a substantial profit.  I believe this price is fair, considering Bob's original offer and the fact that the product is worth $1,500,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is exactly what I was aiming for in my last counteroffer.  It's a good price for me and still leaves Bob with a decent margin.  I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
