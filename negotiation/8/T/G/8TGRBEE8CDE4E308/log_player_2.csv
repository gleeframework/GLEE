"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for you. Given its significance to you, I believe it's important to offer a price that reflects both its true worth and the unique opportunity it presents. After careful consideration, I propose to sell the product to you at a price of $1,400,000. This offer aims to be mutually beneficial, providing you with a chance to secure this valuable asset at a premium compared to its market value, while ensuring a substantial return on my investment. I look forward to your response and the possibility of bringing this transaction to a successful conclusion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply purchase from John, knowing that he's already prepared to pay $1,500,000."
