"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $150. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it for the same price, it makes sense to accept her offer.  You don't need to go through John."
