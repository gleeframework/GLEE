"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in?

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your $10,000 limit. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. While I appreciate the offer, $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about we meet in the middle at $10750? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above your budget of $10,000. While you could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of not closing the deal. It's more efficient and less risky to buy from John at your desired price of $10,000."
