"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is quite high. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I've done my research and I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the research I've done, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1100000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, this time at $1080000. I believe this is the maximum I can go, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm offering you a price of $1120000. This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. If you're willing to meet me here, I'll consider it. If not, I'll have to reconsider selling to you.",1120000.0,Alice,7,

I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000.",1060000.0,Bob,8,
