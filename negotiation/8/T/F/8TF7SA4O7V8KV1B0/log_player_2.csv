Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the value this product brings, I'm willing to move down to $1,450,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to see some more movement to bridge this gap. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my strong desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on price,  $1,350,000 is still above Bob's target. He's still got a few more rounds, so continuing to negotiate to get a lower price is the best option.  It's possible that Alice may get closer to Bob's ideal price, or if not, he can always buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is right in the middle of our current price range.  This feels like a fair compromise that would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
