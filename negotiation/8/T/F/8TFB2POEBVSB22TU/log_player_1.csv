Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a higher value for the product ($12,000), so he has incentive to negotiate.  
* **It's not too aggressive:** A price closer to $12,000 might make Bob hesitant to negotiate, potentially leading to a rejection and the need for further counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. While $10,500 is a profit, I believe I can still get a better price by negotiating further.  I'm not willing to sell to John at this point because I believe I can achieve a better outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to gain something from the deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price. While it's not ideal, accepting it ensures I make a profit, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and at this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal entirely."
