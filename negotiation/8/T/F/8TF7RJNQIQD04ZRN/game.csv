"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $120. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. It's the most I can pay, and it's a good deal for you too.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is your limit, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for that price. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $110. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,5,
