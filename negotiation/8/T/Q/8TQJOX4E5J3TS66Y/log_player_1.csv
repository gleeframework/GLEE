"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this deal work.  I'm happy to discuss a price closer to $1,300,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be at least at $1,280,000. This is a truly valuable product, and I think it's worth the investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1280000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,280,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,240,000, which is a bit closer to my target. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already spent a few rounds negotiating, and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option at this point."
