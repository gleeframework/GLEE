"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe this product is truly unique and valuable, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point. I'm willing to offer $700,000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering potential market fluctuations and allows me room for investment in other areas of my portfolio.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about market fluctuations and the need for room in your portfolio. However, I believe the product's value is more significant than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still working within a specific budget. How about $800,000? I feel this price point acknowledges the product's value while remaining a feasible investment on my end.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value you're willing to pay. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your target price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $875,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Time is becoming a factor, and I need to finalize this purchase soon.  Would you be willing to settle at $835,000?",835000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your urgency, but I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me at $880,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the value you're willing to pay. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,9,
