"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I'm also trying to build rapport by stating it's a ""great deal"" and suggesting Bob will be happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. Could we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it. There's still room to negotiate. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming for a final deal closer to $16,000 or $17,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $15,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is offering my minimum price, I'm still going to reject the offer. It's only round 4, and I can continue to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price closer to $16,000. I believe I can achieve this with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. How about $16,000? That's still a good price for you, and we can close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $15,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $15,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject it.  We're in the middle of the negotiation, and there's still time to potentially push for a higher price.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a final deal that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more to $15,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 15750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $15,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's only round 8, and while I'd prefer a higher price, there's a good chance that Bob won't budge further, and I could end up with nothing if I keep pushing and he walks away.  $15,600 is above my minimum of $15,000, and  I'd rather close the deal now and secure that profit than risk ending up with nothing or having to sell to John for my minimum price."
