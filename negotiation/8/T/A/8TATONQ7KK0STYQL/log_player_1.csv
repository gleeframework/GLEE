{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's slightly lower than what I want to sell it for to John, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your kind gesture. However, I am only able to pay up to $85 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price.  I'm going to try to negotiate higher with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?  That way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
