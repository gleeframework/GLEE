Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the message in a positive way to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open Ended:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to see if he's interested and to get a sense of his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting ensures I don't lose out on any profit.
* **Time Sensitivity:** There's no guarantee that a counteroffer will lead to a better price, and negotiating further risks losing Bob as a buyer. 
* **John's Offer:** John's offer is a safety net, but it's not a higher price. Selling to Bob guarantees a sale at the minimum acceptable price."
