"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product holds, and while $1,200,000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit. If this isn't workable, I'll have to go with another option.",950000.0,Bob,4,
