"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) and also higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. This allows for a few rounds of back-and-forth.
* **Knowing my alternative:**  I'm aware I can sell to John for $1,000,000 at any time, which gives me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Seeking a higher price:**  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm confident Bob is interested in the product and will likely continue to negotiate.
* **Leveraging my alternative:**  Having the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  It's important to demonstrate I'm willing to walk away from the deal if the price isn't right. This helps establish my position and potentially pressure Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise, but still remaining above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but less than my initial offer, indicating I'm open to negotiation but not desperate for a sale.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm not afraid to walk away from the deal, and I'm still confident in my ability to sell to John.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while slowly guiding Bob toward a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is a factor:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but they're still below it.
* **Risk of a stalemate:**  Continuing the negotiation may lead to a stalemate or a price that doesn't reach my target. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable value. It's a safe and reliable option that ensures I don't end up with a worse deal than I could have had.

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement or settling for a price below my minimum is too high. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and provides a swift conclusion to the negotiation."
