"Bob, I see you're still focused on the bottom line. While I appreciate your interest,  $1,280,000 just isn't a workable number for me. I'm willing to budge a little more, but I need to be at $1,320,000. This gives you a great price and me a fair return on my investment. Let's make this deal happen.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
