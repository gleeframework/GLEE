"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that's fair. My starting offer is $900,000. Let's discuss!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is truly unique, and I'm confident its value justifies a higher price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000? This way, we both get a fair deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $775,000? That's a significant move on my part.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate. While $775,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
