"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a great starting point for our negotiation.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to negotiate a bit further. Would you be open to $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. I think this is the lowest I can go without compromising the product's value.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but $10,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is the best I can do without losing money on the deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,
