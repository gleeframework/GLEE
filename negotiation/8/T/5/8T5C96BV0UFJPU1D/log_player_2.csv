Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but $10,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is the best I can do without losing money on the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we're still above our target price, Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line.  Continuing to push could make her less willing to negotiate and we risk her walking away.  $11,000 is a reasonable price compared to our $15,000 alternative."
