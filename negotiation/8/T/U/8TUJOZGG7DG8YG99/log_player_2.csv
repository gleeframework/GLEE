"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's a good idea to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  Bob has 10 rounds and can always purchase from John for $10,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It signals to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but won't overpay.  By offering $12,000, Bob is also leaving some space for Alice to counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $10,000. There are still rounds remaining, so Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. He can also always buy from John for $10,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground, increasing his offer slightly from $12,000 to $14,000. This shows Alice he's serious about the purchase, but still has a limit. It's crucial to stay within his budget while pushing for a better price."
