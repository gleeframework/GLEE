"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $800,000, so I won't sell for less.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values it at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **First offer:** I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a large share of the potential profit. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to monitor Bob's responses and adjust my offers based on his reactions. I'm aiming for a high price while staying within the range that Bob is likely to accept. I'm also prepared to use John as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer:** This suggests he's trying to bargain, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price just yet.
* **Potential for higher price:**  I still believe there's a chance to get closer to my desired price range. 
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  While $800,000 is my minimum, I want to maximize my profits.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial proposal, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing willingness to negotiate but not drastically reducing my expectations.
* **Strategic gap:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, potentially settling around $1,000,000 - $1,050,000, a price that is still favorable to me. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm not yet willing to accept Bob's $950,000 offer, but I'm demonstrating flexibility. 

**Strategy:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a decent profit. If he rejects, I'll continue to analyze his offers and counter strategically.  I'll also continue to monitor the potential sale to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my initial target price range of $1,000,000 - $1,050,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate. 
* **Opportunity cost:** While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, there's a risk of wasting time and ultimately having to settle for John's offer of $800,000.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing a potential sale.  This is a good compromise that balances my desire for a high price with the need to finalize the deal."
