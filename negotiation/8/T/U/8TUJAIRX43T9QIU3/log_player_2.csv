Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value will exceed your expectations. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering your budget and the product's value, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and we are quickly approaching our walk-away price of $1,000,000. Accepting at $925,000 secures a reasonable deal."
