Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I am only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway?

Bob's offer:

Bob is holding firm at $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  There's no point in further negotiation. It's better to take John's guaranteed offer."
