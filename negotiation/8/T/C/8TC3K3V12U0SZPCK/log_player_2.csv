Alice has come down a little, but you're still aiming to save as much as you can. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before going to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,000.  Would you be willing to go to $9,500?  It's closer to what I can afford, and I'm really interested in getting this product."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short on the price. I'm willing to go down to $9800. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and you're now only $300 away from your target price.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more.  It's a good deal, and you're saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
