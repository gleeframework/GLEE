"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than Alice's asking price of $15,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  He knows he can buy the product from John for $12,000, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
