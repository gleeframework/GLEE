```

**Explanation:**

* We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* With only two rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will come up to a price that I'm willing to accept. 
* It's better to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is a better deal for me, rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking the chance of not selling the product at all."
