"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $8,500. How about we try $9,750? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $9,750 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9200.0,Alice,5,
