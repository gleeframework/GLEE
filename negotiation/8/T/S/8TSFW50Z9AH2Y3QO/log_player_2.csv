"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is less than what Bob would pay John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $850,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $950,000, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives Alice some incentive to negotiate further while still leaving Bob with a decent deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is a better price than her initial offer.  While Bob could potentially get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially increasing her price again exists. It's also worth considering that Bob has a higher valuation for the product, meaning he is willing to pay more than Alice's current offer.  Accepting the offer at $900,000 is the most financially sensible option at this point."
