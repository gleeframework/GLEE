"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's something that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  My starting price is $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's talk!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $900000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $950000 is my absolute floor.  This price still provides you with significant value and allows for a good margin for your business. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is closer to my range, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $925000.  This price reflects the value of the product to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's make this happen!",925000.0,Bob,4,
