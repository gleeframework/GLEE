"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's still a great price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm not willing to go lower than $14,000. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable investment.  Let's settle this now and get the deal done.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to find common ground. I'm sticking with my last offer of $14,000. If you're not willing to go that high, I'm going to have to move on to other potential buyers.",14000.0,Alice,7,
