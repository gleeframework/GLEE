"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice only values the product at $80. This leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a fair price considering the product is worth $80 to Alice and you are willing to pay up to $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still a good deal for me. I'm willing to pay up to $150, and it's likely that if I reject this offer, she will either stick with $130 or raise the price even higher. Accepting her offer means I save $20 compared to buying from John and get the product for a price that is still below what I'm willing to pay."
