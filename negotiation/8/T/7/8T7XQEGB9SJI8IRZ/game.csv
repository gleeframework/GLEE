"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. This product would be worth $10,000 to me at most.  Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
