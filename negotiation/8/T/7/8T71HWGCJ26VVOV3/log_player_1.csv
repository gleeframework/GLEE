Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $9,000 sets a high bar and gives you room to negotiate. 
* **Open to Offers:**  By saying you're open to reasonable offers, you show flexibility and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives you a clear bottom line. You won't accept anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $7,500 is below my minimum price of $8,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I have a safety net with John's $8,000 offer, so I can afford to be more firm with Bob and try for a higher price. 
* **Counteroffer is likely:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, but his offer was too low. A counteroffer from me might bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for a product that's worth $8,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer of $8,500 is a compromise between my initial offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $7,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob that the product is worth $8,000 to him, emphasizing the value he'll get even at $8,500.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $8,500 is still above my minimum of $8,000, ensuring I'm still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks again for the offer. $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000.  
* **No further room for negotiation:**  It's unlikely Bob will go higher. I risk losing him and having to sell to John for $8,000.
* **Small gain over John:**  While $8,250 is only $250 more than John's offer, it's still a small profit.

This is a situation where a small gain is better than the risk of losing the deal altogether."
