"Alice, $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering my needs.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering $1200000 for the product. This price reflects its value and allows for some flexibility on your end.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1200000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget limitations. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  While $1000000 is closer to what I need, I'm still not quite there.  I'm offering $1100000 as a final compromise. This price acknowledges your budget limitations while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return.  Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a reasonable return, but $1100000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach a final agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,6,
