Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering the product at $125 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price (even if subjective) can make the offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Urgency:**  Hinting that there's another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

By starting with a higher offer, Alice increases her chances of getting a price closer to her desired outcome while still ensuring a profitable sale."
