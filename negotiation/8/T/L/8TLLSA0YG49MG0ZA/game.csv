"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $10000 to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8500. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering what I've seen so far.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $8000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to pay $7200 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me there.",7200.0,Bob,6,
