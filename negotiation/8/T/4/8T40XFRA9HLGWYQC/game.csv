"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $950,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking to receive.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
