{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It is above your minimum price of $80, but it is also significantly lower than the value Bob places on the product ($150). This should incentivize Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a higher price for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than $80 from John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $115. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $105 is still significantly better than selling to John for $80. It's a good compromise and ensures a sale."
