Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementing his offer very slowly. At this rate, it is unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $1,000,000 within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees the best outcome with the least risk of Bob's negotiation dragging on."
