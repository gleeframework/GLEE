Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its true worth and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High, Leave Room for Negotiation:** By starting at your minimum acceptable price ($10,000), you leave no money on the table. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down. 
* **Highlight Value, Not Just Price:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, justifying the price. This might make him more receptive even if the price is higher than his initial valuation.
* **John is a Safety Net:** You know you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000.  Therefore, there's no pressure to go below that price with Bob.

**Important Note:** While this strategy maximizes potential profit, it's essential to be open to negotiation. If Bob is completely turned off by the initial price, you might lose the sale entirely. Gauge his reactions and be prepared to adjust your approach if needed."
