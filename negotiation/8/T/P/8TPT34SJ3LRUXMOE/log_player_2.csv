"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's target of $1,500,000. There's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a fair offer, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's the best price I can offer at this time. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,300,000 is less than Bob's maximum spending limit of $1,500,000.
* **Better than John's offer:**  This price is also lower than the price John is offering, making it the more advantageous deal for Bob.
* **Negotiation progress:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, it's unclear how much lower Alice is willing to go.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a further breakdown in negotiations."
