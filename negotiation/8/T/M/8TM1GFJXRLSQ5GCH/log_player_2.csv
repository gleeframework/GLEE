(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in the product and are willing to consider your proposal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but $1,125,000 is still above it. He has only a few rounds left, and he should keep trying to negotiate a lower price. If Alice doesn't budge, he can always buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,105,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1105000}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only 3 rounds left. While $1,120,000 is close to his maximum budget, he doesn't have time to risk further negotiation. There's a good chance Alice will continue to hold firm, and he'll end up paying more than he wants.  Buying from John guarantees a price within his budget and ensures he gets the product."
