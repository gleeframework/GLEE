"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your position, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposal. Could you consider $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  Could we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $700,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
