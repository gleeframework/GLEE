"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to move closer to my initial offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to reduce the price by another $25,000. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate. You're right that this product has real value, but the price needs to work for me.  My final offer is $725,000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",725000.0,Bob,6,
