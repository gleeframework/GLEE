"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is the maximum price you are willing to pay, so accepting it is the best option. There's no point in negotiating further as you can't get a better price from Alice. Buying from John would be the same price, so accepting Alice's offer is the most direct way to get the product."
