"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need a bit more of a discount to make this work. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000. It's getting closer, but I'm still not there yet. How about $875,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  While $887,500 is a good price, I'm still hoping to close this deal for a bit less. How about $870,000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both get this deal done quickly. Let me know what you think.",870000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal possible, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $882,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.
