"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I've valued at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  This is a great deal for both of us -  you get a valuable product at a lower price than it's worth to you, and I get a good profit.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
