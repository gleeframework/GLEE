"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I've valued at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  This is a great deal for both of us -  you get a valuable product at a lower price than it's worth to you, and I get a good profit.  Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
