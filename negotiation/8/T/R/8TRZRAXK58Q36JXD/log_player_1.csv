Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential value this product brings, $1,450,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This would still give you a significant profit, and hopefully, we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
