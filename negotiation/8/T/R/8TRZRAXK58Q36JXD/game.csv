"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially even more so than my own.  I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start, I propose $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential value this product brings, $1,450,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This would still give you a significant profit, and hopefully, we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. However, the value of this product to your operations is substantial, and $1,300,000 significantly undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle at $1,375,000.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the sale, and I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial outcome.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,360,000. This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your budget constraints. I believe it's a fair and final offer.",1360000.0,Alice,5,
