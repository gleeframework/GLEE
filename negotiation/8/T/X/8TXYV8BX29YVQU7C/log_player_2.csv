"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

You can likely get a better price than $1,350,000. There's a large gap between Alice's value ($800,000) and your maximum ($1,500,000).  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating."

While $1,200,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, you can still get a better deal. Keep negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target price."
