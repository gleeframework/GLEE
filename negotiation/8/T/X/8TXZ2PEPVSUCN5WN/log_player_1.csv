Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your confidence in the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price given the value we both see in the product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

This is a fair price, given the value we both see in the product and my own budget constraints. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.
