"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob.  However, $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
