Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  However, $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
