"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $85 at this time. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers, how about $95?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, let's try to make this happen.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product now.",100.0,Bob,6,
