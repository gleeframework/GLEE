"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $1050000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice, but I've decided to purchase the product from another seller. I'm not willing to go above $1050000, and I think I've found a better deal elsewhere. Thank you for the opportunity, but I'll be moving forward with another purchase.",0.0,Bob,6,
