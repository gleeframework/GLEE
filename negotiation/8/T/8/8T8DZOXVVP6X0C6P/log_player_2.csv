It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a maximum budget of $1,000,000,  you should try to counteroffer Alice."

I'm offering $800,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for potential negotiation."

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal. It's lower than what John is offering and still within my budget.  Accepting this offer saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John."
