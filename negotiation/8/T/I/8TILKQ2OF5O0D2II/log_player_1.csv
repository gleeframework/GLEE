"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. Since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, I can afford to be slightly more aggressive in my initial offer. This strategy aims to:

* **Set a high baseline:** By starting high, I establish a strong starting point for negotiations.
* **Explore Bob's willingness to pay:**  His reaction to this offer will reveal how motivated he is to buy the product. 
* **Leave room for concessions:** If necessary, I can reduce my price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed alternative with John at $15,000.  Therefore, I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm dropping my price slightly from $18,000 to $16,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price point.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and get a deal that benefits both of us."

```

**Explanation:**

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's getting close.  I'm not willing to accept anything below $15,000 yet, as selling to John would be a more profitable outcome. However, I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping he might increase his offer or find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $14,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm still committed to reaching a deal with Bob but also demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a price that's closer to my minimum.  It's a calculated risk, as it's getting closer to my minimum price point. If Bob rejects this offer, I might be more inclined to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision, but given the limited rounds left, I need to be practical.  Bob is still significantly below my minimum price, and I've already made significant concessions.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit and ensures I don't risk getting a lower price if Bob doesn't budge in the final rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal."
