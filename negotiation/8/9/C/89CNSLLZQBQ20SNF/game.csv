"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $750,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I've done my research and I know this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell at $800,000. I've already met you halfway at $810,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $805,000. This is my final offer.",805000.0,Alice,5,
