"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, but one that is still within a reasonable range considering Bob's estimated value for the product. This allows for negotiation space and also demonstrates my confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. I need to push for a higher price.  I will counteroffer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.  This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a strong negotiation position. I believe this counteroffer is a good compromise that will likely lead to a successful deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has raised his offer, it's still too low for me. I'm not yet willing to sell for less than $12,000.  I'll counteroffer again to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $11,000.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still maintaining a price that is significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $9,800 is still too low.  I'm not willing to accept a price that is less than $11,000 at this point. It's still early in the negotiation process and I can likely secure a better price if I continue to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $10,500.  This is a significant concession, but it still keeps me above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as we are running out of rounds. I'm also mindful that I have the option to sell to John for a higher price if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price requirement. While I'm still hoping to get a better price, it's unlikely that I can reach my goal in just two rounds.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's the more secure and profitable option at this point."
