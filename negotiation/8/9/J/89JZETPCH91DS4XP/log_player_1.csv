"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** We start high ($1,400,000) to leave room for negotiation while staying well above Bob's perceived value and our minimum. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""potential"" and positions the purchase as an ""investment,"" subtly appealing to Bob's desire for gain.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** We want to give Bob the impression that we're willing to negotiate, encouraging him to counter-offer rather than walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While we want to be flexible, accepting this offer would leave a lot of money on the table. We are confident we can negotiate a better deal. 

We will proceed to the next round and present a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your desire to stay within budget. However, the value this product brings is substantial. I could consider $1,375,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end."", 
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** We start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and recognizing his budget concerns. This shows we are listening and willing to negotiate.
* **Firm but fair:**  We make a smaller concession ($25,000) to signal that we are serious about maximizing the price.  
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value, reminding Bob of its potential benefits.
* **Compromise language:** By framing our counteroffer as a ""significant compromise,"" we nudge Bob towards accepting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product and staying within my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price point, $1,325,000 is still a significant amount below our minimum of $1,500,000 and our target selling price. We are only on Round 4, and we have ample time to negotiate a more favorable deal.  The risk of losing Bob to a complete standstill in negotiations is relatively low at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget considerations."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Collaborative Tone:**  We use phrases like ""working with me"" and ""find a middle ground"" to encourage a sense of partnership and encourage Bob to compromise.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We offer a smaller concession of $25,000, signaling that we're getting closer to our desired price and are less willing to make significant moves.
* **Finality and Value:** By presenting this offer as a fair solution that addresses both parties' needs, we hope to nudge Bob towards acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise, Alice. Considering the value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,330,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're entering a critical stage of the negotiation. While Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is getting closer, it's still significantly below our $1,500,000 walk-away point. We need to signal that our previous offer was a serious attempt at compromise. We'll reject this offer to show we're firm on value while remaining open to a reasonable counter within the next couple of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment.  However, my previous offer of $1,350,000 was a firm attempt to find a fair price. I'm willing to hold at that price, but I need to see some movement on your end to justify letting go of this valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** We reiterate our previous offer of $1,350,000, signaling that we're reaching the limit of our flexibility.
* **Justification:** We emphasize that we're making a concession by not increasing the price further, and we need to see Bob reciprocate.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning that we need to ""justify letting go,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency without resorting to hardball tactics.
* **Open to Negotiation (Slightly):** By not explicitly stating it's our ""final offer,"" we leave a tiny bit of room for Bob to make a compelling counter, should he be very close to our price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your position on the matter. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final price of $1,340,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. Here's why:

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** Bob increased his offer by only $10,000.  We are still $160,000 away from our guaranteed sale price with John. Continuing the negotiation carries a higher risk of Bob stalling or making minimal moves, leaving us with a less favorable outcome.
* **Bob's Language:**  His use of ""final price"" suggests he's unlikely to move significantly.  We've been firm, and further concessions would set a bad precedent. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** We have a bird in hand with John. Why risk losing $160,000 for a potentially lengthy and uncertain negotiation process?

**It's important to recognize when the potential upside is outweighed by the risk of losing a guaranteed favorable deal.**"
