"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  $9,000 is a reasonable counteroffer that still allows him to save a good amount of money, and it shows Alice he's serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500.  This price reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer. At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer. He's getting a good deal at $9,500, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the product or ending up buying it from John for a higher price."
