{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,999. I know this product would be valuable to you, and I'm offering it at a price below its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to make the most money. Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $12,000, Alice wants to see if she can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $11,999 is a strong strategic move. Here's why:
    * **Appealing to Bob:** Bob values the product at $10,000. By offering it at $11,999, Alice is presenting a price that's still significantly less than Bob's perceived value.
    * **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate down a little. This starting price gives Alice some wiggle room.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice hasn't lost anything. She can confidently sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
