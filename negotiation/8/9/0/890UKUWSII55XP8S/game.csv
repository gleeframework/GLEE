"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000. It's a steal considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking around $12000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm thinking closer to $13500. This product really is exceptional, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny for you. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product is exceptional, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13500. Would you be willing to consider $12750? That's the highest I can go.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However,  $12750 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $13125?  Let's bridge the gap and get this deal done.",13125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $13000. That's my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
