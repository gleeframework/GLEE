"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. There's still a chance to get closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm going to make a final push for my target price of $1,500,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as this is what I'd get from John.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk going lower than my target price. John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price, so it's time to close the deal with him."
