"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value to you might be higher. Let's start with a fair offer. How about $140?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly for my time and resources invested in this product. Let's aim for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $132.50? That's the best I can do.",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm glad we're getting closer. Considering the value of the product, I believe we can reach an agreement. How about $134? I think it's a fair price given the quality of the product.",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $134 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $133, but that's my final offer. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",133.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your patience and understanding. I've considered your latest offer and believe we can come to an agreement. I propose $133.50 for the product. This allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction.",133.5,Alice,7,
