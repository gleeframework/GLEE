Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you want to start high with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that's still highly profitable for you.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reinforces the product's worth, aiming to influence Bob's perception of its value.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.
* Carefully consider Bob's personality and negotiation style. If he's known to be very price-sensitive, you might adjust your strategy slightly."
