"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your position, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product offers. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,800,000? This takes into account its true value while recognizing your initial interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, however,  $1,800,000 is still  too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, the value of this product is substantial.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
