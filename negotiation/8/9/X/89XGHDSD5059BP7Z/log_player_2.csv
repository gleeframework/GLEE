Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your position, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product offers. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,800,000? This takes into account its true value while recognizing your initial interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, the value of this product is substantial.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has stated that $1,500,000 is her final offer. She's already come down significantly, but she's still way above your budget.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:** John offers the product for $800,000, which is well within your budget and saves you a significant amount compared to Alice's offer.
* **Limited negotiation time:**  While you have a few rounds left, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. It's better to take the safe option now.

Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a high risk of ending in no deal, forcing you to buy from John at the last minute anyway."
