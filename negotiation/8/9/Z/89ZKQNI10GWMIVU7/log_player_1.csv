"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I believe Bob will see this as a fair starting point, given his value for the product is higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can still get closer to Bob's value of $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $11,250. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to make a profit closer to Bob's perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,900 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500. I'll counteroffer again and see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11100} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, this time to $11,100. I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, considering the limited rounds remaining and Bob's previous counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only four rounds left, the negotiation has stalled.  Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price. To avoid risking losing any money, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. This guarantees me at least my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
