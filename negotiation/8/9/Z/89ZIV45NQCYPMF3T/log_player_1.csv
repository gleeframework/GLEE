{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $145 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I still have rounds to negotiate.  It's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $145 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $160 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $152. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $152 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150 and we are in round 4, I believe this is a fair price and I don't want to risk losing the sale."
