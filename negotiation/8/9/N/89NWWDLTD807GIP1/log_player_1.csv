Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 
 
This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and still having a good chance of Bob accepting. Here's why:

* **My minimum:** I'm getting $500 more than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so he's still getting a good deal at $9,500. This increases the likelihood he'll accept.
* **John's alternative:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not taking a significant loss. 

This strategy allows me to potentially get a higher price while still securing a sale if Bob decides to pass."
