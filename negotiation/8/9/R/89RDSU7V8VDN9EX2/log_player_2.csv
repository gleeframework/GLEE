"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but you can likely do better.** You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $9,000 is still a significant amount. 
* **The negotiation process is designed for you to try and lower the price.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to counter-offer and potentially reach a better deal.

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round. Aim for a price lower than $9,000, but not too low that Alice is likely to immediately reject it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility.  While I see the value in your product,  $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $8,000.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to lower the price to $8,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your desired price.**  Her counteroffer of $8,500 is a good compromise.
* **You have limited rounds left.**  While you could try to negotiate further,  you've already made some progress. There's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise in the later rounds.
* **The risk of buying from John is substantial.** If you reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further, you risk Alice getting frustrated and ending the negotiation. Then, you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $8,500 represents a good balance between saving money and ensuring a deal."
