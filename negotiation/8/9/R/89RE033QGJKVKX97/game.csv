"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $9800, which is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to accept this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm afraid $10200 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at the middle of my previous offer and your last offer, which would be $9800 + $10200 / 2 = $10100. I'm willing to pay $10100 for the product. Would you be willing to accept this price?",10100.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10050. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10050.0,Alice,7,
