Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly above your minimum:** You're starting high, leaving room for negotiation without dropping below your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob knows the product is worth more to him, giving him incentive to negotiate and potentially come closer to your desired price. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, you can still move up or down depending on his counteroffer and your assessment of the negotiation.

Remember, the key is to be confident but flexible in your negotiations.  You want to maximize your profit, but also keep the deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price and even below the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John. It's worth rejecting this offer and pushing for a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** You should counter Bob's offer with a price closer to your initial offer ($1,150,000). You can slightly lower it to $1,100,000, indicating a willingness to compromise, but remaining above John's offer.
* **Assess Risk:**  Consider Bob's motivations and if he's likely to walk away. If you think he's serious about the product and willing to pay a higher price, continue negotiating. If he's just trying to lowball you, selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's lower than your initial offer:**  This shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** You're pushing for a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **It's still above John's offer:** This ensures you're getting a better deal than selling to John.

By making this counteroffer, you're showing Bob that you're serious about selling to him, but you're also not willing to accept his lowball offer. You're leaving room for further negotiation while also protecting your bottom line."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below your desired price and only slightly better than John's offer. It's worth rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:**  You should counter with a price that's closer to the middle ground, like $1,090,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still getting closer to your target.
* **Evaluate Bob's Behavior:**  Consider how seriously Bob is taking the negotiation. If he keeps making low offers, you might want to consider selling to John to avoid wasting time. However, if he's showing some willingness to compromise, it's worth pushing for a better price."

This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:** You're demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
