Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to secure this valuable product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on $12,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, so it's the safest and most economical choice."
