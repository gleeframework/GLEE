"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still hoping to get closer to your asking price, but I'm trying to be reasonable. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that.  However, $975,000 is still a bit below my desired price point. Would you consider $1,000,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
