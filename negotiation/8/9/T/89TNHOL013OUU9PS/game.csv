"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go up to $12,000. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $14,000? It's still a good deal for you, and closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could you meet me in the middle at $13,000? That would be a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
