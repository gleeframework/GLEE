"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations, and I'm happy to discuss the value proposition further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  While I see value in the product, I'm only willing to pay $800,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a number that reflects the product's potential. How about we meet halfway and consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $1,000,000 is my absolute limit.  It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and shows my commitment to acquiring this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
