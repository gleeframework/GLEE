Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  While I see value in the product, I'm only willing to pay $800,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can work something out.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer:

It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and shows my commitment to acquiring this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is unlikely to budge significantly from his $1,000,000 offer. 
* Accepting his offer would mean a $500,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.
* While further negotiation is possible, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of Bob not reaching a price point that's acceptable. 

It makes the most financial sense to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
