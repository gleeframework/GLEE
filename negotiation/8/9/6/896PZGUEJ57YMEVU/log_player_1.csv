"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit more than $85, but I'll keep John as a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  That gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
