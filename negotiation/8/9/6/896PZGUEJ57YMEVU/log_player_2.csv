"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Offering $85 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
* **Provides a reason:**  The message explains the counteroffer, making it clear that Bob is interested in the product but wants to save money. 
* **Sets the stage for negotiation:** This counteroffer invites Alice to respond and potentially engage in further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  That gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** $92.50 is a reasonable compromise between Bob's initial counteroffer of $85 and Alice's initial offer of $100. 
* **Saves money:** This price is still significantly lower than the $120 that Bob would pay from John.
* **Avoiding further rounds:** While there's always a chance of getting a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or further negotiation dragging on is high. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids potential complications."
