Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offers are getting progressively lower, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate with him will only result in a lower price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
