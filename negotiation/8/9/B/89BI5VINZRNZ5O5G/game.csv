"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to get this product. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to offer you $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll enjoy the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
