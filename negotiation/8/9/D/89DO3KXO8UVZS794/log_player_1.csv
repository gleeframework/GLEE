Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential return on investment. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere closer to your desired outcome.

**Important:** This is just one strategy. You could test different starting prices and adjust your message accordingly.  The key is to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob."
