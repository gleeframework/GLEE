Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $10,500 is still too low, and I think I can get a better deal."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  $10,750 is still significantly higher than what John is offering."
