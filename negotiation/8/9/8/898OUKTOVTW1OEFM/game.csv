"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than you're willing to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm still feeling a bit too high at $1,250,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
