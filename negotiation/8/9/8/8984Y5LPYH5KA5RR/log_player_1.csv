Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $13,000. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible without Bob rejecting the offer.  
* **The Offer:** Offering it at $13,000 gives Bob a $2,000 discount, which is a strong incentive. This price also secures a significant profit for you ($5,000 above your minimum). 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know for sure whether Bob would accept a lower offer. If you had more information about Bob's negotiation style, you might adjust the price accordingly."
