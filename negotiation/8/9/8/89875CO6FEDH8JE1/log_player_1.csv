Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how Alice should approach this negotiation and her optimal offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Reservation Value:** $12,000 (This is the minimum she'll accept).
* **Bob's Valuation:** $10,000 (He won't pay more than this).
* **John's Guaranteed Purchase:** Alice has a safety net â€“ John will buy the product at her reservation value.

**The Strategy**

Alice is in a strong position. She knows she can sell the product for $12,000 regardless. Therefore, she should aim to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible without going below her own minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $9,999.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 9999 
}
```

**Why this offer makes sense:**

* **Profit Maximization:**  This offer aims to maximize Alice's profit by getting as close to Bob's valuation as possible.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $9,999 feels significantly cheaper than $10,000, potentially swaying Bob.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can confidently sell to John for her minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate further. Alice should be prepared to hold firm or consider a slight adjustment if she feels it's worthwhile."
