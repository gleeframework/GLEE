"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for a price of $11,000. This is a great deal for you as the product is worth $10,000 to you, and it allows me to get a little more than my minimum asking price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget and above John's offer. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $10,000."
