"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that acknowledges the significant value it holds for you.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking of a price more in the range of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,050,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to move a bit from my original offer, how about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to move from your initial price, but I still think $1,125,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,062,500. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, however, anything under $1,100,000 is pushing the boundaries of what I can accept. I'm open to meeting you halfway one last time - how does $1,100,000 sound?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering $1,075,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
