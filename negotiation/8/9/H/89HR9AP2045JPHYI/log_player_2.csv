# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially setting the price at $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to secure a better price."
