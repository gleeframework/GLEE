{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially setting the price at $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you. What do you think?"",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to get as much as possible for the product. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (John), her offers to Bob should aim higher.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:**  Offering the product for slightly less than $1,200,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gets a good deal compared to Alice's backup plan, and Alice maximizes her potential profit.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice."
