"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate and allows for a potential compromise.
* **Positive and engaging message:** A friendly and positive message can help create a more receptive environment for negotiation. 
* **Addressing Bob directly:** Using his name makes the message more personal and engaging. 

**Note:** This is just the initial offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is not acceptable, it shows he's interested. There's room for negotiation.
* **Preserving options:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:** While selling to John guarantees $150, I can potentially get more by continuing the negotiation with Bob. We have 9 rounds left, which is enough time to explore further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm open to negotiation. How about $140?  That's a good compromise, and it's still less than my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my minimum:**  $140 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for a potential deal while still being profitable.
* **Compromise language:** Highlighting a ""good compromise"" can make the offer more appealing to Bob, showing flexibility and willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasis on negotiation:** Reminding Bob that I'm open to negotiation encourages further discussion and a possible agreement.

**Note:** I'm still keeping my eye on John as a backup option. However, I believe there's a good chance of reaching a deal with Bob within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a little high at $140. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $120 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Limited time remaining:** We've already completed 4 rounds, leaving 6 rounds remaining. This is not enough time to make multiple counteroffers and risk losing out on a better deal with John.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is closer to my minimum than Bob's current offer. While I would prefer to maximize my profit, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high at this point.

**Note:** While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the time constraint and the risk of Bob rejecting further counteroffers make selling to John the most prudent decision at this juncture."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $120 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $130, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One last counteroffer:** This is my final counteroffer before I consider selling to John. 
* **Small concession:** I'm dropping the price to $130, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but shows a willingness to compromise further.
* **Urgency and positivity:** I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal and using positive language to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Note:** I'm hoping this final counteroffer will convince Bob. If not, I'll be moving on to sell the product to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really trying to stay under $120. How about we split the difference at $125?  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are already in Round 6, leaving only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a high risk of Bob rejecting any further counteroffers, leading to a lost opportunity.
* **John's offer is the safest option:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is more than Bob's current offer and aligns with my minimum acceptable price.

**Note:** While I would have preferred to reach a deal with Bob, the time constraint and the risk associated with further negotiation make selling to John the most prudent choice at this point."
