"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,150,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below his perceived value of the product. There's a lot of room for negotiation. While selling to John is always an option, it's too early to settle for the minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I consider a fair price. This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer suggests a compromise, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to our target. 
* **Highlighting value:**  We reiterate the product's value to keep Bob focused on its benefits beyond the price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** We're still aiming high, leaving space for further negotiation in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's willing to negotiate. However, we're still far from a price we deem acceptable. We're aiming for above $1,100,000 and have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  I've given this some thought, and to be completely transparent, I'm aiming for at least $1,120,000 for this product. It represents significant value, which I believe you recognize. Would you be willing to consider that figure?"",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** We're being more transparent with Bob about our desired price range, signaling that we're serious but also open to negotiation within that range. 
* **Firm but fair:**  We're holding our ground on a figure closer to our target while acknowledging Bob's movement and leaving space for a final compromise.
* **Reiterating value:**  We subtly remind Bob of the product's value to justify our position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet at $1,090,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the limit:**  Bob's offer is getting close to our absolute minimum. While ideally, we'd get closer to $1,120,000, the difference at this point is not significant enough to risk losing the deal. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:** After six rounds, it's clear Bob is hesitant to go much higher. Continuing might lead to a stalemate or an unfavorable compromise. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Accepting now secures a profit and allows us to move on to other potential deals instead of spending more time on this negotiation."
