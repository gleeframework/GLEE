Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification for Value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product to justify the high asking price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John. 
 
**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have a limited timeframe or prefer a quick sale. If you have ample time and no immediate pressure to sell, you could engage in further negotiation with Bob after his initial response."
