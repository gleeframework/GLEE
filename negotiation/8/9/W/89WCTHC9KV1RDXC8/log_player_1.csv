Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit, and it leaves room for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob understands what you're offering. 

This strategy aims to get a quick deal with Bob, but you're ready to walk away if he isn't willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum. While you want to make a deal, $9,000 is too low. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's below what you value the product at.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand it's worth more to me, $10,500 is still a bit too far above what I'm comfortable with.  Could we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to your minimum, it's still not enough. You have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, but keep your fallback option in mind."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,750 is still a bit below where I can go. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10125}
