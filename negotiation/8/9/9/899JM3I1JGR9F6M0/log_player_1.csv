"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$60 is way too low.  I'm not going to accept that. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100.  This is still significantly more than Bob's offer and is a reasonable compromise. Hopefully, this will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $90.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping that it will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal.  If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer one more time. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85 as my final counteroffer. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the ongoing negotiation. If Bob rejects this, I'm going to sell to John for $120."
