# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, it's worth more than $120 to us. Considering its worth to you is $80, I propose a fair deal of $95 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between its intrinsic value and your perceived worth, ensuring both parties are satisfied. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.
