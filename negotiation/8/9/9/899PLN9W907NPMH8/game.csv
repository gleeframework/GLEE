"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still above what I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. That's my minimum price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you $12,750. It's a great deal for both of us!",12750.0,Alice,5,
