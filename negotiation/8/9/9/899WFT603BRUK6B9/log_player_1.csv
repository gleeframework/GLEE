Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  There's no room for negotiation to get a better price. Since I can sell to John for the same amount with no hassle, it makes more sense to go with the guaranteed sale."
