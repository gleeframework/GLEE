"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider something closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too far below my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, acknowledging your interest in the product. Let's work together to bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still too steep for me. I could potentially go up to $750,000 if you're willing to negotiate further.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a significant distance from my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,000,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still pushing it for me.  How about $800,000? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
