"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm not able to accept that offer just yet.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still allows me to achieve a fair profit while also giving you a good price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
