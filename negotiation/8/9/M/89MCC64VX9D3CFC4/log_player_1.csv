Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of Alice's strategy and her offer:

**The Strategy**

Alice has a strong fallback option (John) willing to pay her the product's full value to her. This means Alice doesn't need to settle for less than $1,500,000.  She can use this leverage to aim high with Bob.

However, Bob is only willing to pay $1,000,000.  Therefore, Alice needs to propose a price that is:

* **Higher than $1,000,000:** To incentivize Bob to even consider the deal.
* **Lower than $1,500,000:**  To leave room for negotiation or a counteroffer from Bob. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I make it available elsewhere.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** By highlighting the exclusivity, Alice creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **Fair Deal:**  The language is carefully chosen to avoid sounding too aggressive while still emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Price:**  $1,350,000  gives Bob a significant discount (over $100,000) compared to what John is willing to pay, making it tempting for him to accept.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price, or he might reject it outright.  Alice has to be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet her needs."
