Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could sell the product to John for $120, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $110 is a price point that:
    * Allows you to make a profit.
    * Offers Bob a perceived discount, making the purchase more appealing.
    * Leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This initial offer aims to find a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing your potential profit."
