"I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I can meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $160. Would you be willing to go down to $150?,150.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $150. I'm willing to meet you at $155, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $155 is the best price for this product. Would you be willing to go down to $145?,145.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $152.50. That's as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",152.5,Alice,7,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $155, but that's it. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to consider other options.",155.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $155. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $147 and $155, which would be $151. Would you be willing to accept that?",151.0,Bob,10,
