Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential return on investment.  I could consider a price of $950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  However, $950,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could meet you halfway at $775,000.  This offer keeps us both reasonably close to our desired outcomes. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum without several more rounds of negotiation. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which aligns perfectly with my needs. It's time to move on to a sure thing."
