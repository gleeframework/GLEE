"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $700,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product's value to you is closer to this price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above $800,000 in my valuation. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
