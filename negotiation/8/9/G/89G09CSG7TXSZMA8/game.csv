"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this product. I believe it holds great value for you and I'm confident it will be a significant asset.  My asking price is $1,200,000.  This price reflects the product's true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations.  I'm willing to compromise further, but  I need to secure a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm prepared to accept $1,000,000. This price allows for a fair profit margin for both of us and ensures a successful transaction.  Let's work together to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
