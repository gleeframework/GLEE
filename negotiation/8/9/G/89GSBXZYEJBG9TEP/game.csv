"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a stretch for me. Given my budget and the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you consider $890,000? That's a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm ready to make a final offer. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product.  This represents a significant commitment on my end, and I'm hopeful it's a number we can both agree on.",875000.0,Bob,6,
