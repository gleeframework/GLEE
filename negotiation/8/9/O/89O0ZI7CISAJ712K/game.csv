"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline. I am still unable to meet at $1,750,000 due to my financial constraints. I would like to continue our discussion with a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
