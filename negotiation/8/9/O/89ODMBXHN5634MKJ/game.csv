"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a little too low for me to consider right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price for the product, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm serious about wanting to buy this product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
