"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100. This allows room for negotiation and leaves the possibility to lower the price if necessary. By sending a message along with the price, I'm engaging Bob and making the offer feel more personal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $90 is better than my minimum acceptable value of $100, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's closer to my ideal value of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. By addressing Bob's concerns and showing flexibility, I'm hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with his offer.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower the price to $97.50. This reflects the value of the product while giving you a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
``` 

I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value of $100. By suggesting a ""middle ground"" and emphasizing the value of the product, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced it's worth that much. I'm willing to pay $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still below $100. With only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I can reach a deal with Bob that meets my minimum requirement.  It's better to sell to John for $100 and secure a guaranteed profit."
