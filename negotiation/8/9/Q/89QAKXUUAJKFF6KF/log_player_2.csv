"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will work out well for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $13,500 is closer to his target, he can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a reasonable price that is fair to both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $13000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $13250.  This reflects a compromise on both our parts and allows us to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's already close to his target price of $12,000, and continuing to negotiate risks either getting stuck at a higher price or losing the opportunity altogether.  He's better off accepting this offer and closing the deal."
