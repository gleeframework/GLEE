"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a good starting point for negotiation. It's above Bob's perceived value, but not so high that he'll immediately reject it.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the win-win nature of the deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer.

**Important considerations:**

* This is just the first offer. I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses and the progress of the negotiation. 
* I'm aware of the alternative buyer (John) and will use that information to determine my negotiating limits. 
* I'll be mindful of the 10-round limit and try to close the deal before I'm forced to sell to John."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and it's also below my initial offer of $14,000.  Accepting this offer would be a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. This gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable agreement.
* **Avoiding immediate sale to John:** Selling to John for $15,000 would be a good outcome, but it's not my ideal outcome.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price.

**Next steps:**

* I will need to counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, but still within a reasonable margin that could entice Bob to accept. 
* I'll consider factors like Bob's initial counteroffer, my own valuation of the product, and the remaining negotiation rounds when formulating my counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will work out well for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I've moved halfway from my initial offer of $14,000 to Bob's counteroffer of $12,500. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Justifying the price:** I've emphasized the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. This helps frame the price as fair and reasonable.
* **Positive tone:** I've maintained a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** While $13,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation if Bob isn't ready to accept.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Remaining rounds:**  I'm aware that there are only 7 rounds remaining, so I need to be efficient with my counteroffers. 
* **John's offer:**  While I'm trying to get a better price from Bob, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000. This serves as a benchmark and a fallback option. 
* **Bob's reaction:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only willing to pay $13000 for the product. This is a reasonable price that is fair to both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still below my initial offer and my counteroffer. Accepting it would mean taking a significant loss.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  Bob's offer shows that he's willing to move closer to my desired price. This suggests there's still room for negotiation to potentially reach a more favorable outcome for me.
* **Avoiding immediate sale:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a good option, I'm still aiming for a better price.  It's better to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a deal closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still within a reasonable range that could entice him to accept. 
* **Remaining rounds:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic and efficient with my counteroffers.
* **John's offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a benchmark and fallback option if the negotiation with Bob falls through."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation productive and amicable.

**Key considerations:**

* **Remaining rounds:**  With only 5 rounds left, I need to be mindful of time and keep pushing towards a deal.
