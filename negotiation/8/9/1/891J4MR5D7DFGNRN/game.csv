"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value and my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle, Alice. However, given my budgetary constraints, I am unable to accept $1050000. I would like to propose a final offer of $1000000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you and we can conclude this negotiation successfully.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to accept $1000000. As a compromise, I'm willing to offer you a slightly higher price of $1030000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
