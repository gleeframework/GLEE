"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to show that you're serious about negotiating and that you're not willing to accept her initial offer. It's also important to be bold in the first few rounds to establish a negotiating range.  We'll see how Alice reacts and adjust our strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it's getting closer, there's still room to negotiate. I want to see if I can push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John.  By rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer, I continue to signal my commitment to getting the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, I'm still staying below my budget and pushing for a price closer to my target.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Alice to consider, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I've got a few more rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $1,500,000 before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but this time it's just a small increase to show good faith. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for Alice, where she'll be willing to accept, considering she's already dropped her price significantly. If she rejects, I'll be prepared to either make another counteroffer or consider buying from John, as we are running out of rounds."
