"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob is looking to save as much money as possible and Alice's offer is above his maximum budget.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, and $7,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to get the best price.  While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, he can still try to get a lower price. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $8,250.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,250 and $8,500. I'll sell the product to you for $8,375. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where the negotiation is getting close to his maximum price, and he's already had multiple rounds.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go lower. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
