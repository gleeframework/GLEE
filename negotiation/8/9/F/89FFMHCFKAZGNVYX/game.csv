"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate the value you've placed on your product. However, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $85? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also working within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $90 is still a little higher than what I can comfortably spend right now. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $85.  It's a fair price for the product, and I hope you'll reconsider.",85.0,Bob,4,
