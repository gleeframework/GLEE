"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11000, which is a good deal for both of us. I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm going to offer $10500. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $11500 is my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",11500.0,Alice,5,
