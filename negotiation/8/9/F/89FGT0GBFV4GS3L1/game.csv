"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I believe is fair.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original prices, so I propose $1,025,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
