Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Minimum:** The price is significantly higher than John's $10,000 offer, ensuring a good profit even if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome with Bob while still having a safety net with John."
