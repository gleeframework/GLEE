# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is higher than Alice's valuation and closer to your maximum budget, it's still better than buying from John for $12,000. Accepting this offer saves you $500."
