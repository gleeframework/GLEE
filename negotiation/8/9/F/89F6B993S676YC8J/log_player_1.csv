Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $130 leaves space for Bob to potentially counteroffer, while still ensuring a significant profit for you if he accepts outright. 
* **Considering the Alternative:** While you have John as a backup buyer, aiming higher with Bob first makes sense given his potentially higher valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob's counteroffer of $100 suggests he values the product significantly, as it's already a substantial increase from your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate between your initial offer ($130) and Bob's counteroffer ($100). Rejecting this offer opens the door for a potential compromise closer to your desired price.
* **John as a Backup:**  While selling to John is an option, it's worth exploring if you can secure a higher price from Bob before settling for your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $115, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  You're still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($80) and closer to your initial offer.
* **Gauging Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will help you understand how eager Bob is to buy and how much room there is for further negotiation."
