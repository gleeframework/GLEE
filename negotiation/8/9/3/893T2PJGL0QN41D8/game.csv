"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $925000?",925000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to be responsible with your budget, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $975000? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and it's closer to my initial offer. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $975000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $962500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it's closer to my budget.",962500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $980000. I believe this is the minimum price I can accept for the product, considering its value to you and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $967500? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make. What do you think?",967500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure I can get approval for $967500. How about we try $960000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it's a bit closer to my budget.",960000.0,Bob,6,
