{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value of $80 but significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate if needed and also leaves me with a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $105. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $105, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $100. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a little more. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price, and I'm not willing to settle for a deal that leaves me feeling dissatisfied.  I'm hoping to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $102.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my own costs.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $102. This is a small decrease from my previous offer, showing that I'm still willing to negotiate, but also that I'm firm in my desire to get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair and reasonable offer and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $102 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $98. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $150.  While I'd like to get a higher price, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiations with Bob and it seems like he's not willing to go any higher.  John's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it's guaranteed, so I'm going to take it."
