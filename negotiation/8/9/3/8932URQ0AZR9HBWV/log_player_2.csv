"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be valuable to you at $1,300,000. We understand its worth to you is $1,200,000, but we hope this offer will be acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While buying from John immediately for $1,200,000 is the ideal scenario, it's worth exploring if Bob can get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting the first offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
