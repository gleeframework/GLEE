,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to drop my price to $17000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see you're open to negotiation. $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, so how about we settle on $15000?  Let's try to make this work.",15000.0,Bob,4,
