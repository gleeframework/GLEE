"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $20000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to drop my price to $17000.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see you're open to negotiation. $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, so how about we settle on $15,000?  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 15000}
