"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm confident it would be even more beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.  This is a price that allows me a solid return while still leaving room for you to profit significantly.  Consider it a mutually beneficial opportunity. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",900000.0,Alice,1,
