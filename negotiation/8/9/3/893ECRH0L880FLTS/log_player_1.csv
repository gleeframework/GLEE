Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, offering it slightly below that at $14,000 gives him a good deal while maximizing your profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Time Value & John:**  There's a slight risk Bob might decline. However, having John as a guaranteed backup at $10,000 provides a safety net. It's better to aim high initially and potentially earn an extra $4,000."
