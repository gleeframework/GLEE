"Hi Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its true value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's potential warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $1,500,000? This reflects a more reasonable compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my initial offer of $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and my budget. Let's not waste any more time - this is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility,  $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
