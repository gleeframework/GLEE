Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its true value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

While I could continue pushing for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly committed to this negotiation and has steadily increased his offer. Accepting at $1,293,750 secures a good profit above my minimum, and avoids the risk of pushing him away in the final rounds."
