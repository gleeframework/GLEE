"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product for a price that reflects its worth.  I'm asking for $1,200,000.  This gives you a significant opportunity to acquire it at a price well below its true value to you. Let's start the conversation!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve a good outcome.  Let's keep the conversation moving forward.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our respective needs. Let's work towards a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. While $950,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product at a good price and me to reach a profitable outcome.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your previous offer, and it's the highest I can go at this time. Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $975,000 is still not quite where I need to be. To reach an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This represents a fair compromise that's only a small distance from your offer. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",990000.0,Alice,7,
