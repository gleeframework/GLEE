Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my bottom line, I'm willing to hold firm a little longer. It seems he's willing to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price than $1,075,000, especially with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $1,100,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a very fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this stage, I'm making it clear that $1,100,000 is my final offer. This conveys firmness while still leaving room for Bob to accept. It's a calculated risk, but I believe the potential gain from Bob or John justifies it."
