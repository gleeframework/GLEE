"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm not at liberty to disclose details about its exact nature, but I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer.  Consider this a chance to secure something potentially game-changing for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but you can get the product for a higher price from John.  While you don't know the exact value of the product, you know it's worth at least $800,000 to Alice. This means there's potential upside if you buy from John and can resell the product for a profit. 

Since you have a guaranteed backup option with John, it's wiser to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate with John to get a lower price."
