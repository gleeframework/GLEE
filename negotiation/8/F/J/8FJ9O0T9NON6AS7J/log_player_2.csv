"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,000 is still too high. 
* **Strategic thinking:** Rejecting allows Bob to negotiate a lower price. 

**Next steps:**  Bob should make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to my value for this product. How about $8,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,000 is still too high, but it's a good starting point.
* **Strategic thinking:** Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiations.  It's a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable value of $8,000. 
* **Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still showing he's serious about making a deal.

**Next steps:**  Wait for Alice's response to this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $8,750 is a reasonable compromise, as it's closer to Bob's ideal price.
* **Strategic thinking:** While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk of further rejection and losing valuable time increases. Accepting at this point ensures a good deal without risking missing the opportunity. 

**Next steps:**  Bob should accept the offer and purchase the product for $8,750."
