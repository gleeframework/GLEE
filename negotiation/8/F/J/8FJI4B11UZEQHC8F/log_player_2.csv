"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product holds value for me, but not at that price. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $800,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the $900,000 offer is still significantly below what I can accept.  This product has incredible potential and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment.  Let's settle this now - how about $1,100,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and while it's above your ideal budget, it's within your $1,000,000 limit.  Continuing to negotiate has a risk:

* **Alice might not budge:**  She's already come down significantly. 
* **Time is running out:** You have fewer rounds to reach a deal, and going to John means missing a potentially better deal with Alice.

This offer represents a savings of $100,000 compared to John, making it a reasonable compromise."
