"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment. Would you consider lowering it to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and so am I.  I can go up to $975,000, but that's really as high as I can go.  It's a fair offer considering we're both compromising.",975000.0,Bob,6,
