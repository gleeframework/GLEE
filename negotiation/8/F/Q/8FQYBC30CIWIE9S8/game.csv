"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $900,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would give you a great deal, and I could still achieve a profitable sale.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your target. Would you consider $825,000 for the product? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still below what I believe the product is worth. Let's compromise again. How about $850,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $837,500 is still a bit low. How about we settle on $845,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.",845000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we make one final push to close this out? I'm willing to offer $840,000. This is a very competitive offer and saves us both from further negotiation.",840000.0,Bob,8,
