Bob's offer:

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my budget and the market value, I believe we're still quite far apart. I'd like to propose an offer of $1050000. This is the highest I can go while still making sure I can afford other expenses. I hope this might be a starting point for further discussion.
