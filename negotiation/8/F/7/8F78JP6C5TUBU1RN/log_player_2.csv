Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,400,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What are your thoughts?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,300,000. This is a reasonable price that should be more acceptable to you, and it's getting closer to my target. What are your thoughts?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate down, but she's moving slowly. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll get her down to a price significantly better than John's offer before we run out of rounds.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
