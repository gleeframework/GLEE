"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. Can you meet me halfway?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit high, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $115. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $122. It's the lowest I can go without losing money, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",122.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $122 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $118. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",118.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $121. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",121.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $121. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $119. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",119.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made it clear that $121 is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower. I think $119 is still a bit too low for me, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price.",121.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're unwilling to go any lower, but I'm still not comfortable with $121. I think we're too far apart. I'm going to have to consider buying the product from John for $150. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at $120, I'll reconsider buying from you.",120.0,Bob,10,
