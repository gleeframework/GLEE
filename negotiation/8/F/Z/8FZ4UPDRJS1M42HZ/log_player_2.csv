# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I'm interested, $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

Reasoning: I'm starting with a low but reasonable counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below my $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: Alice came down in price, but $120 is still over my budget. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my limit to see if there's any wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

Reasoning: I'm inching closer to my $100 limit but staying firm on getting a price I'm comfortable with. This offer shows Alice I'm serious about buying but need her to meet me closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $110? It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  Alice is slowly moving towards my budget, but $110 is still over my limit. I'll make one more counteroffer closer to $100 to see if I can get the best possible deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work. How about we settle at $95? That's the absolute highest I can go."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

Reasoning: I'm holding firm at $95, signaling this is my final offer. This gives Alice a chance to accept a price slightly above my fallback option ($100 from John). If she rejects this, I'll likely move on to John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
