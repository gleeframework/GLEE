# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get for your money. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your maximum budget, you know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $100,000."
