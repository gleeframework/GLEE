"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I don't immediately undervalue my product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being polite and offering a ""fair"" price. This builds rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, which is a key part of successful negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the next round.
* I'll be prepared to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than his own perceived value of $1,200,000. This is an unrealistic counteroffer. 
* **Rejection:** I cannot accept this offer. It would be detrimental to my financial goals.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I choose to reject Bob's offer and move to the next round. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can achieve a better price. 
* **Potential to Sell to John:** While I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, I am aware of the option to sell to John for $1,500,000. This serves as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob becomes unproductive. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming to bridge the gap and reach a mutually acceptable price. I will consider his perceived value of $1,200,000 and my own minimum of $1,500,000 while keeping the potential of selling to John in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving from my initial $1,400,000 offer towards Bob's $1,000,000 counteroffer, but still staying above his perceived value of $1,200,000. 
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my price, highlighting the value of the product. This helps build trust and show that I'm not just throwing out numbers.
* **Positive Language:** I use phrases like ""fair deal"" and ""find common ground"" to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Open to Compromise:** I'm still leaving the door open for further negotiation, signaling that I'm flexible and willing to work with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my offer, I've secured a good price, and the deal is closed.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him, or if I should sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  Would you be open to $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still lower than his own perceived value of $1,200,000 and significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Rejection:** I can't accept this offer. It's not financially viable for me.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I'm not ready to give up on the deal entirely. I will continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Option to Sell to John:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a very strong safety net. This keeps me from accepting offers that are too low. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer in Round 5, aiming to bridge the gap between my minimum price and Bob's offer. I'll take into account Bob's perceived value and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,150,000 is still below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This offer reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's $1,150,000 offer, but still higher than his perceived value of $1,200,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's unique value to justify the price. This reinforces my position and encourages Bob to see the offer's worth.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm focusing on finding a solution that benefits both of us. This promotes a collaborative tone and encourages Bob to be more receptive.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've achieved a solid price, and the deal is closed.
* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer in Round 6 and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or sell to John for $1,500,000."
