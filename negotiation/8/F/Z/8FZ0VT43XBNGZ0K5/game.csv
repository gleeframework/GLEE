"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still looking to save a bit more, however.  Would you be willing to consider $1,325,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,325,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,337,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know if this works for you.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
