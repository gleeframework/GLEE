"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 was a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can understand my position.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to come up a bit.  How about $800,000 even?",800000.0,Bob,6,
