"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we try $7,000?  That's a fair offer and closer to what I had in mind.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,200.  This is my final offer, as I know I can get that selling elsewhere.",8200.0,Alice,5,
