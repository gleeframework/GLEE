"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to get a better price. How about $125?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $135.**  This is a good price for Bob as it's within his budget of $150.
* **Going to John would cost $150.**  There's no point in risking a longer negotiation for a potential lower price when Alice is already offering a reasonable price.
* **Counteroffering again might backfire.** There's no guarantee Alice would accept a lower price again.

Accepting the offer at $135 allows Bob to buy the product and save $15 compared to buying from John."
