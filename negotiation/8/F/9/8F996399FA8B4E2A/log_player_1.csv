"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It's also higher than my minimum acceptable price, giving me some flexibility. I'm optimistic that Bob will find the offer attractive, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell for that price, as it would result in a loss for me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the following rounds. While selling to John would guarantee a profit, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  However, I'm also showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. Can you consider $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not willing to settle for $95 yet.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the following rounds. I still have some time and flexibility, and I'm hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John is always an option, but I'm determined to get the best deal possible from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still too far off from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need at least $100 for this product. Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to accept $102.50. "", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

I'm coming down further to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm using a specific number ($102.50) as it demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a sense of fairness. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $102.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $101? It's a small difference, but it's still a bit more than I'd like to pay 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $101
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $101 is close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's a decent profit for me, and it's likely that Bob won't offer any more."
