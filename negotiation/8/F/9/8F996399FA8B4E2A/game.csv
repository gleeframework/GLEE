"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. Can you consider $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still too far off from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need at least $100 for this product. Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to accept $102.50. ",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $102.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $101? It's a small difference, but it's still a bit more than I'd like to pay",101.0,Bob,6,
