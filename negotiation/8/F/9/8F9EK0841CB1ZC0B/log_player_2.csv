"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above your desired price of $1,500,000. You can reject her offer and still purchase the product from John, albeit at a higher cost. It's likely you can negotiate with John to bring the price down a bit, but without that information, rejecting Alice's offer is the most strategic move to minimize your cost."
