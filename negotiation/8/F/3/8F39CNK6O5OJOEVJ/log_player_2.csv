"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a starting offer significantly below your target. This leaves room for negotiation and signals you're looking for a good deal. 
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important throughout the negotiation.  
* **Leaving Alice Room:**  While this counteroffer is significantly lower, it still leaves Alice room to negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room:** While Alice states this is her lowest price, there's usually some flexibility in negotiations. It's worth testing that.
* **Closer to John:** Alice is moving closer to John's price.  This means our fallback option is becoming more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but it's still a significant investment for me.  How about $900,000, and we have a deal?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between her current offer and our previous one, which can be a common tactic to signal willingness to compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""and we have a deal"", we're implying this is our final offer, encouraging Alice to accept. However, we haven't completely shut the door on further negotiation if needed.
* **John Option in Mind:** We're getting close to the point where accepting John's offer might be the better choice if Alice doesn't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains:**  Negotiating further is unlikely to yield significant savings. Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line.
* **Saving $25,000:** While not a huge difference from John's price, we've managed to save some money, which is our goal. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and potential lost opportunity. Accepting now secures the deal."
