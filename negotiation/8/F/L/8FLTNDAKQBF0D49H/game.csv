,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in buying it for $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $122.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close this deal. Let me know what you think.",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $122.50, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  How about $118.75?  It's a small difference, but it would help me out a lot.  Let me know if that works for you.",118.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get the best deal. I can go down to $119.50, but that's really my final offer. It's a small difference, but it's important to me.  Let's close this deal!  What do you say?",119.5,Alice,7,
