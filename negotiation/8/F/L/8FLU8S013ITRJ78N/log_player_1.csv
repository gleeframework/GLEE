Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $130 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I want to try to get a better price than $130.  Since I have 10 rounds, there's still time to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more for this product.  How about $140?  It's a fair price for the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 140}
