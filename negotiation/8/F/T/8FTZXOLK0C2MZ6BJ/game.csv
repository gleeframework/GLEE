"Dear Bob, thank you for your response. I appreciate your interest in our product. While we understand your budget constraints, we must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $700,000. Our product is valued at $800,000, reflecting its high quality and unique features. However, I would like to propose an alternative that might better suit your needs.
