Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000 vs. $10,000) we set a high anchor. Even though we know John will buy it for $15,000, Bob doesn't have this information.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The high starting price allows room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can gradually reduce the price, still aiming to stay above our minimum of $15,000.
* **Conveying value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception and potentially justify the higher price in his mind. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. We need to be prepared to adjust our approach based on Bob's response and willingness to negotiate."
