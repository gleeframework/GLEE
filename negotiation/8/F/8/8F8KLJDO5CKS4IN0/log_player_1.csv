Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. I understand the value of the product, but your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. I could potentially stretch to $700,000.  This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while respecting my financial limits. Let me know if that works for you.
