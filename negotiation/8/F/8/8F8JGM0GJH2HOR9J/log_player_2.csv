"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $14000 for this valuable item. We're confident it will meet all your expectations and more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, there's potential to negotiate further and get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in your product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. In light of that, I propose a price of $13500 for our product. This reflects a compromise between our original prices, while still allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $13,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. Considering the value of the product and our costs, I propose a price of $13250. This offers a slight increase from your last offer while still being within our acceptable range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has successfully negotiated the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer of $14,000.  Accepting this offer at $13,250 will save Bob $1,750 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds makes accepting the offer a smart move."
