Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $10,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John or potentially negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to gauge her willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer leaves room for compromise while still remaining within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and he can potentially get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

Bob increases his offer slightly, showing his willingness to compromise but still pushing for a price closer to his preferred range. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially encourage Alice to accept the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $8,500 is getting closer to his budget, he can still get the product for less from John.  There's still a chance he can negotiate a lower price with Alice in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob now makes a final counteroffer, matching John's price. This is a risky move, but if Alice accepts, Bob gets the product for his maximum price. If she rejects, he can buy from John."
