Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on it. However, I am looking for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $11200, which is still a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand and respect your position, Alice. I've done some research and found that similar products are being sold for around $10000 elsewhere. Based on this information and my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $10800 for the product. I hope this offer aligns better with the current market value and allows us to reach an agreement.",10800.0,Bob,6,
