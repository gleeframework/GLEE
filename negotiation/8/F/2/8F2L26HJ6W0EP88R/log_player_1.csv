Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy and offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. Any offer below this, he'll reject. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  The ideal scenario is to sell it for slightly less than $1,500,000 to Bob, saving you the hassle of finding another buyer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I want to give you a chance to acquire it before I explore other options. Let me know if this price works for you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlights the product's benefit to Bob's business.
* **Alternative Options:**  Subtly reminds Bob there's competition without revealing John's offer.
* **Price:** $1,450,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate slightly upward (if he's inclined) while still securing you a significant profit.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Pay close attention to Bob's reaction. If he counters, you can negotiate further. 
* **Walk Away Point:**  Remember, you have a strong alternative with John. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob tries to lowball you too much."
