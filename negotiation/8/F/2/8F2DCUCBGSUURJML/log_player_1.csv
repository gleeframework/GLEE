Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500.  Let me know what you think.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a higher price, and rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8750. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the current offer. I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of him before I settle. There are still a few rounds remaining, and I believe there's potential to negotiate a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
