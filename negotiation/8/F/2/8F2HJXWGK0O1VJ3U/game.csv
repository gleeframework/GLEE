"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,250,000? That's still a great price for you, considering the value of this product. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is what it's worth to me. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
