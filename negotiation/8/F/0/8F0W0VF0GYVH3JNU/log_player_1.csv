"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm also considering the potential value to Bob and the possibility of reaching a compromise. I'm leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant return on my investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  I have 8 more rounds to reach a deal, and selling to John is always an option if I fail to secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm making a counteroffer at $11,000. It's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and reach a compromise. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is still below my initial target, it's now above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and the risk of not reaching a deal increases with each round. I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the possibility of having to sell to John for a lower price."
