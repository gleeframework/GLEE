"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price of $7200 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",7200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7200 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $7800 for the product. Can you consider that?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7800. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $8200? This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",7500.0,Bob,6,
