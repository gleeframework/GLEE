We've reached round 8, and Bob's offer is still $90.  While I could try to negotiate further, the time pressure is mounting, and I'm not confident I can get close to my target price of $120.  To avoid risking a failed deal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  It's the safest option, and I'll be guaranteed to get a price I'm happy with."
