"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a good profit, so I'm starting with a high price that leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $15,000 is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, giving Bob space to counteroffer. 
* **Positive message:**  I want to start the negotiation on a positive note, highlighting the value and opportunity. 
* **Open ended question:** I encourage Bob to engage by asking for his thoughts, rather than just giving him a yes/no choice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:** I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup:**  While selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll try to reach a compromise before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, but it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price significantly from the previous round. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Justifying the price:** I explain the reduction as a significant compromise while still maintaining profitability.
* **Re-engagement:** The message encourages Bob to continue the negotiation by asking for his thoughts.
* **Strategic pricing:** $12,000 is a good middle ground, leaving room for further negotiation without significantly impacting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction in price, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $10,500 is just above my minimum value of $10,000.  This is a good profit, especially considering the potential for further negotiation in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially get a higher price in future rounds, there's a risk that Bob will become unwilling to negotiate further or that the deal will fall through entirely.
* **Time is a factor:** We're already in Round 4, meaning I have fewer rounds to reach a deal before I have to consider selling to John. Accepting Bob's offer is a relatively safe and profitable decision."
