""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to your endeavors.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it seem like Alice is willing to compromise.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** This offer aims to find a middle ground where both parties benefit. While it's less than Alice's minimum, it's significantly more than what Bob would get it for elsewhere.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By phrasing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" and asking for Bob's thoughts, the offer encourages a quick response and potentially avoids drawn-out negotiations."
