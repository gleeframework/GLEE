"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm aiming to get the product for closer to $80, so I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  Seeing how Alice responds to a lower offer will give me insight into her willingness to negotiate. 
* **Establish a negotiation range:** By starting lower, I'm setting a floor for the negotiation, hoping to work our way towards a mutually agreeable price.

It's a riskier move, as Alice could reject it outright, but it gives me more room to negotiate upwards in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $82.50 is still above her value of $80. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm looking for a price closer to $80. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if she'll drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the negotiation:** By countering instead of accepting, I'm showing Alice I'm still interested but want a better price.
* **Splitting the difference (almost):** Her offer of $82.50 and my previous $65 average to $73.75.  Offering $75 is a slight concession on my part, signaling willingness to compromise, but still leaves room for her to move down a bit.
* **Time constraint:** We're approaching the halfway point of the rounds. I need to start moving towards a decision soon, and this keeps the negotiation progressing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your proposal, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get a bit closer to my original offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $79.75. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Alice's value:**  Alice is likely very close to her lowest acceptable price ($80). It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Significant savings:** $79.75 is a good deal, saving me over $20 from John's price and a decent amount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Time:**  We're past the halfway point in the rounds. Continuing to negotiate for a few dollars more might not be worth the risk of the deal falling through, especially since I'm content with this price."
