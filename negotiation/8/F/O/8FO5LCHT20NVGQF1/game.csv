"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground!",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $10,900 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, and it allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's see if we can close this deal.  This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I've gone as high as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $10,850, but that's my absolute limit. Please reconsider and meet me at this price.",10850.0,Bob,8,
