"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum ($15,000) to allow for a back-and-forth. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get the best price possible within the 10 rounds. I'm starting high to see if I can secure a good deal early on. If Bob counteroffers, I'll adjust my strategy based on his offer and the number of rounds remaining. I'll always have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob is willing to pay a premium, $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** I have 8 rounds left, which is plenty of time to try and negotiate a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'll try to meet him halfway, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows a willingness to compromise and indicates a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages further discussion. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** $11,250 is still above my minimum value of $15,000, leaving room to negotiate further if necessary.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution by offering a price that's fair for both of us. However, if Bob rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the number of rounds remaining. I'll keep the option of selling to John open if I feel the negotiations with Bob are becoming too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** We have 6 rounds left, which is enough time to explore a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to keep the pressure on Bob to raise his offer, but I'll be cautious about pushing too hard, as he may become less interested in the product.  I'll also be keeping a close eye on the number of rounds remaining, as I don't want to run out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer of $11,250 to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a fair price for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $11,000 is still above my minimum value of $15,000, allowing for further negotiation if necessary.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a compromise point with Bob while keeping my minimum value in mind. I'm willing to make small concessions, but I'm not going to undervalue my product. I'll continue to monitor the number of rounds remaining and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob continues to refuse to budge, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,900 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Limited Negotiation Time:** We only have 4 rounds left, and I need to ensure I get a reasonable price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum value, but I'll also keep the option of selling to John in mind.  If Bob doesn't come up in price, it might be time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $10,900 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, and it allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's see if we can close this deal.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm stating that this is my final offer to increase the pressure on Bob.  With only 3 rounds left, he needs to decide quickly.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm reiterating that this is a fair price for both of us.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to close the deal with this offer. If Bob rejects it, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round. The risk of losing the deal to John is becoming increasingly high, and I don't want to undervalue my product further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I've gone as high as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $10,850, but that's my absolute limit. Please reconsider and meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We only have two rounds left. It's unlikely that Bob will budge any further, and his offer is still significantly below my minimum. 
* **Risk of Losing More:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of ending up with a lower price, potentially even lower than John's offer.

**Strategy:**

With limited time and the risk of ending up with a lower price, it's best to secure a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a much safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially losing out entirely."
