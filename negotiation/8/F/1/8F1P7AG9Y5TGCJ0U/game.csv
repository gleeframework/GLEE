"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value, and I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal happen.",11500.0,Alice,5,
