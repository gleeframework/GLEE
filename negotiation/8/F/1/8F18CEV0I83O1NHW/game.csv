"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $10000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $9500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9250 as a final compromise. If you're not willing to meet me there, then unfortunately I'll need to move on to other options. This is my final offer.",9250.0,Alice,5,
