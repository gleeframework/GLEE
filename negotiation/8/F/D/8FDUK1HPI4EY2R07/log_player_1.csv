Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we want to aim higher since we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other interested buyers and a ""limited-time offer,"" we incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** Starting with $1,450,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. We can potentially go as low as $1,500,000 and still meet our minimum.
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while ensuring the sale."
