Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer.  Would you be interested in $8,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about $8,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,250.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $8,000 and avoid further back-and-forth."
