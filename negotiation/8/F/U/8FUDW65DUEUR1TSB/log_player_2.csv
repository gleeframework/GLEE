"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its unique features and benefits. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is her ideal price. It's far too high for me. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for presenting the product and its features. While I appreciate the value, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower than your asking price. Would you consider a price closer to $5,000?"", 
""product_price"": 5000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you have a budget constraint, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still too high. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $6,500. Would you be willing to consider that figure?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, $6,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is barely budging on price, and it seems unlikely she'll come down enough to make it worthwhile for me. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed offer of $8,000."
