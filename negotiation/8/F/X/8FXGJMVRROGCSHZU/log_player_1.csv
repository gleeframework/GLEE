"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) but lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:** A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Fair Offer:**  $130 is a fair starting point, leaving both of us with potential profit if we reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($100), but I still believe I can get a better price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoid Settling Too Early:**  Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but I'm aiming for a higher profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little lower than what I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $125? That would still be a great deal for you, and it would let me get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway, but I'm not giving up too much. 
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes the deal being ""great"" for Bob to encourage acceptance.
* **Maintain Profit:** $125 still gives me a good profit while staying within Bob's perceived value range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still within the negotiation range and can try to secure a slightly higher price.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  I can still meet Bob halfway again, or offer a slight reduction from my previous counteroffer to encourage a deal.
* **Avoid Selling to John:**  $115 is a decent profit, but I still want to maximize my earnings if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slight reduction from my previous counteroffer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Agreement:**  The message emphasizes reaching a deal and a fair price for both sides.
* **Closing the Gap:**  $120 is closer to Bob's offer and might be more appealing than my previous counteroffer."
