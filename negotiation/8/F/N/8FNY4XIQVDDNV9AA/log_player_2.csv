You can do better than $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

I'm offering $9,000.  This is a good compromise point, as it's halfway between my maximum and Alice's initial offer.  Let's see if she bites!"

I'm going to stick with my strategy of trying to find a middle ground.  $9,500 is a good compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current price, and hopefully it's attractive enough to make her want to close the deal."

I'm going to try to close the gap just a bit more. This is almost halfway between Alice's offer and my preferred price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."

Alice is not budging much, and I'm starting to get impatient. I'm going to buy from John. It's still a good price, and it's time to move on."
