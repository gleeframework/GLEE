"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $13,000. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 represents the high-end value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the product's true worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $17,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
