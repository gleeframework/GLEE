"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price. I have a safety net with John's offer of $15,000, so I can afford to be a bit more firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $13,500? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $12,000 is my absolute maximum. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm not confident I'll be able to get him to budge further, and I'm already four rounds in. I've got a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, so I'm going to take that and move on."
