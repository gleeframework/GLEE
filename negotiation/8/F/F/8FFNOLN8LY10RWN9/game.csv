"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1000000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1150000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1150000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1075000. It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1075000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
