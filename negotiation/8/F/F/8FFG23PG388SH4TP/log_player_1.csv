Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I agree it has value, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This represents a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
