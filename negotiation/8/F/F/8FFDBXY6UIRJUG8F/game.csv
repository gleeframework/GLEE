"Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement, but I really like the product and would like to try to make a deal work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
