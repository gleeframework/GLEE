"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counteroffering.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to get a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer. This is a strategic move to see how flexible Alice is with her pricing. By offering $10,500, Bob is still below his maximum price point of $12,000 while leaving room for negotiation.  This strategy allows Bob to potentially secure the product at a much lower price than John's offer, while still showing interest in the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit low for me. Could you meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point and is still lower than John's offer of $12,000. Accepting this offer would allow Bob to secure the product for a price that is within his budget and represents a good deal.  Further negotiation might yield a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice might walk away or Bob might end up paying John's higher price.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
