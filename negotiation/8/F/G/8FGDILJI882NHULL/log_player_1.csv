Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  The ideal scenario is to find a price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999. This ensures you get more than your minimum, and Bob gets it for less than its worth to him.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I've carefully assessed its value and believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its significant potential. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is straightforward, indicating that you value the product highly.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning that you've ""carefully assessed its value"" adds weight to the price. 
* **Urgency (Without Being Pushy):**  The phrase ""limited-time offer"" and mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate a bit but hold firm to a price above your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Relationship Matters:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill.
