Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, aiming to maximize profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  The price is still lower than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a friendly approach:** The message is friendly and casual, making Bob feel comfortable engaging in the conversation.

This strategy allows for negotiation while keeping your profit potential high. If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer and still potentially sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, you can still try to get a better deal.  Since you know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, there is room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob. Consider offering a price slightly higher than $8,000 but still below your ideal price of $10,000.  This will show you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a better outcome than Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to pay $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to compromise, but it's not a huge drop from your previous price.
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the price for both of you, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Focus on the Value:**  You're not just focusing on the price but also hinting at the value of the product to Bob, hoping he'll see it's worth a bit more.

By offering a slightly higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer, you're showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I can't go above $8,000 for the product. It's within my budget and I believe it's a fair price. Let me know if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has firmly stuck to his $8,000 offer, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a higher price.  At this point, selling to John for $8,000 guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of continued negotiation leading to a stalemate or a lower offer from Bob.

It's better to secure a guaranteed sale at your minimum price than to risk getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation with Bob that may not result in a better outcome."
