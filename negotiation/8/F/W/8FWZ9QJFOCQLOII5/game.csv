"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a little too low for me.  How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm still interested but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about $95? It's a fair compromise and lets us both get what we want.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
