"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
Alice's offer is higher than both her value and my maximum price. I should try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I think $13,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $12,800. It's a fair price that still reflects its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a price I'd consider, $12,800 is still above her value. I'll counteroffer again and see if I can get closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $12,900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is barely budging and is still significantly above her value. I need to push harder or consider John's offer soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the price difference is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $12,000. This is a fair offer considering the market value, and I'm serious about buying at this price."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm being firm by sticking to my $12,000 offer, which is actually Alice's value for the product. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only five rounds left, I need to signal that I'm serious and won't endlessly negotiate. This could push Alice to accept.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $15,000 is starting to look more appealing. If Alice doesn't budge significantly soon, I might have to go with John."
