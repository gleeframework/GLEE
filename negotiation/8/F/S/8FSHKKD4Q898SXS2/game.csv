"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a solution that works for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,200,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 falls significantly short of the value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 to find a compromise. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
