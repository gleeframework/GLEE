"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,150,000 is already a very competitive price.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $1,100,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
