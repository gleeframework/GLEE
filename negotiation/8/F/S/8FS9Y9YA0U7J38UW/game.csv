"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $10000?  I'm serious about buying it if we can reach a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I can see that you're a serious buyer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I think that's a fair price for this unique product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
