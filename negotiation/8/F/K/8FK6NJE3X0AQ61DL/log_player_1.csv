"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $650,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 9 rounds left, so I'm hoping I can negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $650,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
