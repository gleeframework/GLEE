**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go significantly above his current offer of $980,000.  He's been consistently incrementing his offers in smaller amounts. Holding out for a slightly better deal from Bob carries the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  

It's time to secure the guaranteed profit and sell to John."
