"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $17,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but if she doesn't come down significantly, Bob should go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

Bob is starting with a lowball offer of $10,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and puts pressure on Alice to negotiate.  While he's willing to pay up to $12,000, he's trying to get the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the same product from John for $12,000. There's still room to negotiate with Alice, and Bob should try to get her down to a price closer to $12,000 before he commits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

Bob is offering $11,500, which is halfway between his maximum budget and Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to save some money.  He's hoping that Alice will see this as a reasonable counteroffer and be willing to finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is not budging much.  Bob's budget is $12,000, and Alice is offering $14,500. At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to meet Bob's price.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will be successful, and it's better to go with John and be sure of getting the product within his budget."
