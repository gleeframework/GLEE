"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1000000 is simply too low. It's not even close to what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1150000. This is still a significant discount from what I originally offered, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1050000 is still a bit too far off from what I need to make this work. To be completely honest, I'm getting close to closing a deal with another buyer for a higher price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time - $1100000.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll have to move forward with the other buyer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're close to closing a deal with another buyer, but I'm still very interested in purchasing the product from you. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000. Please consider this my final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
