Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation, ensuring that we have a good starting point for a back-and-forth.
* **Attractive Offer:** The price is attractive to Bob as he would still be making a profit, while allowing me to make a good amount as well.
* **John as Safety Net:**  I have John's offer as a safety net, so I'm not pressured to accept a price lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's low offer.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that is more in line with my desired price, and hopefully find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. It's not even close to what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1,150,000. This is still a significant discount from what I originally offered, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain Profit Margin:** This price still allows me to make a profit, but it's closer to Bob's offer, potentially leading to a faster agreement.
* **Firm Stance:**  I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm open to further discussions. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's closer, the gap is still too significant.
* **John's offer is the safe choice:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 would provide me with the best possible outcome. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:** If I keep rejecting and counter-offering, I risk losing both Bob and John as potential buyers, leaving me with nothing.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and move towards a more certain outcome with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too far off from what I need to make this work. To be completely honest, I'm getting close to closing a deal with another buyer for a higher price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time - $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll have to move forward with the other buyer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm positioning this as my final offer to create urgency and potentially push Bob towards accepting.
* **Midpoint Compromise:**  $1,100,000 is a compromise, offering a midpoint between our previous offers.
* **Creating Pressure:** I'm subtly mentioning another buyer to create a sense of competition and encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While this is my ""final"" offer, there's still some room for negotiation if Bob comes back with a counteroffer close to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're close to closing a deal with another buyer, but I'm still very interested in purchasing the product from you. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000. Please consider this my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and he's declared it his final offer.  There's no room for further negotiation.
* **John provides the best option:**  With John's offer of $1,500,000, I can secure a much higher price and avoid the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob. 
* **Time is a factor:** The longer I negotiate with Bob, the more likely it is that I'll lose both him and John as potential buyers.

I'm choosing to sell to John, as it guarantees me the highest possible price and minimizes the risk of losing both potential buyers."
