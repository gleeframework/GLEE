,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can realistically afford right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit too high at $10,000.  I'm ready to close the deal right now for $9,500.  Let's make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,6,
