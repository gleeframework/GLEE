"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000 for this product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What are your thoughts on this proposal?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's worth and our mutual desire to strike a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget of $800,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. This is the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
