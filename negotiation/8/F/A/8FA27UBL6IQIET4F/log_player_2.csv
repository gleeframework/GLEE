Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $13,000.
