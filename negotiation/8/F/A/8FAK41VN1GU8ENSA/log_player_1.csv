Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Aiming high, but staying reasonable:**  $100 is a strong starting point. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle while ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Considering your fallback:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while keeping the offer attractive to Bob."
