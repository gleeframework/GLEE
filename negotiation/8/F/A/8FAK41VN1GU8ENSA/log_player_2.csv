"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's first offer. There's a chance she might come down to a price closer to her $80 value. You can always fall back on buying from John for $120 if needed."
