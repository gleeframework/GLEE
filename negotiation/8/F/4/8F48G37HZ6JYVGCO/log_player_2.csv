"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and it's a chance for you to acquire it at a price that's well below what it's worth to you. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and what John is offering. Buying from John saves you a considerable amount of money ($600,000) and ensures you stay within your budget."
