"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe holds great value. Considering its worth and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $120 for you to consider. This offer aims to be fair while ensuring we receive a reasonable return for our investment. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your $80 limit and what John offers. Buying from John gets you the product at the best possible price."
