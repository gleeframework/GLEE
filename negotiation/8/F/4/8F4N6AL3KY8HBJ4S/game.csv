Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.,90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $75, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $80.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",80.5,Alice,5,
