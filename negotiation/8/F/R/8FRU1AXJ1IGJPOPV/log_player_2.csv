"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price. You have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, so there's no need to immediately accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the realm of possibility. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  By starting at $950,000, you give yourself room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Highlight your value:**  Mentioning your value for the product helps justify your offer and can be persuasive. 
* **Open the door for discussion:**  By saying you're ""open to discussing this further,"" you keep the negotiation process open and show flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1100000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. What do you think?

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget of $1,000,000.  You still have the option of buying from John for that price, so there's no need to rush into accepting.  It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my range, it's still a bit higher than what I can comfortably commit to right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your initial offer and your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering you the product for $1080000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, but still reflects the value I believe the product holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget of $1,000,000.  While you've been able to negotiate her down, there's a good chance she'll continue to hold firm.  At this point, it's more beneficial to go with the guaranteed deal with John, as the risk of further negotiation with Alice could lead to a longer process and potentially still end with you exceeding your budget."
