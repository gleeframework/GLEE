"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than the product's worth to you ($1,200,000).  While it's a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is a last resort if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work for me. Would you be willing to consider that figure?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer, and it's still above the product's worth to her ($1,200,000).  Accepting this offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John and is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer or reaching a stalemate is high.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price."
