"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a more than fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so it's better to reject Alice's offer."
