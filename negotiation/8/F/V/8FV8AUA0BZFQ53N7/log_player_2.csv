Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I can go.

It's time to cut our losses with Alice.  She's unlikely to go below $850,000, and we have a guaranteed option at $800,000 with John.  It's better to secure the lower price than risk getting stuck in an endless back-and-forth."
