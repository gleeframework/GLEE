Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning you believe the product is worth a ""significant amount"", you're adding perceived value without explicitly stating a number.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning listing it publicly, you create a subtle sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you aim for $12,000, starting high allows you to potentially negotiate down to $11,000 or even $10,500 while still exceeding your minimum sale price.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have a guaranteed sale with John for $10,000, ensuring you don't lose money."
