"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $2,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting your counteroffer. While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential this product holds for your business.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to part with it for $2,100,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to pay $2,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from it.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
