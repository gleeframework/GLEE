"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the market value of the product is around $10,000.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. It's a fair compromise considering the market value and our previous discussions.",10800.0,Bob,4,
