"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this amount, considering the product is worth $10,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is more than my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me, and hopefully, Bob will be more willing to accept this offer. I'm still leaving some room for negotiation but showing my willingness to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum price, but I've already been through a few rounds of negotiation. I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing the deal entirely. Selling to John for $8,000 is the most secure option at this point."
