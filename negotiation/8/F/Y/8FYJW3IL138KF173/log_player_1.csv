I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me there, or if he'll counteroffer.  I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I won't go below my minimum value of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I'm happy to sell the product for $1,200,000,  I believe it's worth more than that. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping Bob sees that this is a fair price and we can reach an agreement."

Bob is unwilling to budge from his price. While I would like to get more for the product, I'm not willing to continue negotiating with him. At this point, it's better to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $1,200,000."
