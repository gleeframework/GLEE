"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's potential value. While I recognize its unique qualities, $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $500000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $675000. This is a great opportunity to own a unique item, and I think this price is more in line with its value. Let me know if you're interested!",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $675000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $600000. This would be a fair price considering our previous discussions and my willingness to move closer to your original asking price. I hope we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,4,
