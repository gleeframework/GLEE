"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and get a good price.  I'm also leaving a gap for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like I'm being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $10,500, I believe I can do better.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come up a bit more.  This counteroffer is still above my minimum, but it leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but just slightly this time. I'm aiming to meet Bob halfway and signal that I'm serious about making a deal. This offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and come up just a bit more."
