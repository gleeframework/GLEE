Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob's value) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed sale).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept. Since you have a guaranteed sale, you have some leverage to push for a higher price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but within reason:**  $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It's closer to your guaranteed price but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Confident and positive language:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" positions the product favorably.
* **Focus on ROI:**  Framing the price in terms of Bob's potential return shifts the focus away from the pure cost.

**Important Note:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before you walk away and take John's guaranteed offer."
