"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it for $950,000. This still leaves room for both of us to make a great deal.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial outcome.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high.  Given our previous discussions, I'm confident we can agree on $900,000. This price would allow you a significant profit while giving me the value I need. Let's bridge the gap and close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
