"I'm interested in the product, but I think $25000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Bob,2,

This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident this product will deliver a lot of value for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",22000.0,Alice,3,
