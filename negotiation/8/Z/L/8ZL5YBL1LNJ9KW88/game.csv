"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $8,800.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal!",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,400. Can you consider that?",8400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. I'm still willing to go down to $8,600. This is a significant compromise for me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you too. Let's make it happen!",8600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,400 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in an additional service to sweeten the deal. Would you consider that?",8400.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the additional service.  However, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's the best I can do, and it's still a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",8500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is my absolute maximum budget. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",8000.0,Bob,10,
