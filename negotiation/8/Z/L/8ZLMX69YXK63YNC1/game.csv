"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a price that works.  I'm starting with $1,750,000.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to you.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your budget, but I need to be a little higher than $1,350,000 to make this work for me.  Let's compromise at $1,450,000. It's a fair price, and it gets us both closer to our goals.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  To meet you in the middle, I can do $1,400,000. That's the best I can offer.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm not quite ready to accept $1,400,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,425,000? This would give us both a good deal, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1425000.0,Alice,7,
