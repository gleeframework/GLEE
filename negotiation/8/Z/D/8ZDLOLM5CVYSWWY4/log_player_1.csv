"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still lower than my minimum. This allows some room for negotiation.  I'm also framing it as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $11,000 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're motivated to sell, and I'm still interested in buying. How about $12,300? That's a firm offer from my side. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds and the potential deal with John, so I'll need to be more aggressive with my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're firm on that $12,300.  I'm willing to come down to $12,800. That's a big step for me, but I really want to make this deal work. Let me know if you're willing to budge a little."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,550? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a price I'm happy with.  While $12,550 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not confident I can negotiate any higher in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John for $15,000 is the safest bet to ensure I get my desired price."
