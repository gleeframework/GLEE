"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but I can't go as low as $12,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $12,750. I think this is a fair compromise.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $13,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to go up to $12,900, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",12900.0,Bob,6,
