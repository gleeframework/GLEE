Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because you have John willing to pay your full asking price of $1,200,000. 
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob sees value in the product ($800,000) but it's less than what you value it at.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $800,001 and $1,199,999 represents a potential deal where both you and Bob are better off than your alternatives.

**Strategy**

You want to start high to give yourself room to negotiate while still staying within a reasonable range of Bob's valuation.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1100000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting closer to your desired price but leaving room for Bob to negotiate.
* **Confident Tone:**  You're not undervaluing the product or seeming desperate.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrasing suggests you're open to hearing Bob's perspective and potentially negotiating.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower. 
* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might factor that in and start even higher. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. You have the security of John's offer, giving you a strong position."
