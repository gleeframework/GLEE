While $975,000 is getting closer to what I need, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price and I'll try to counteroffer one more time.  I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.
