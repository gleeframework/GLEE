"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a minimum of $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential value to your business.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value it could bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle. I'm now offering the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'm thinking $975,000 is a fair price for the product. I believe it's a good compromise that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.  If you're truly interested, I believe this is the final offer I can make.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
