"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident in the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll get from using it.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we settle at $10,500? That seems like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,5,
