Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and stating my asking price, making it clear that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Product Price:** I'm starting at my minimum acceptable price ($12,000), knowing I can always lower it slightly if needed.

This approach balances my desire to maximize profits with the need to secure a sale. It leaves room for negotiation without risking losing the sale entirely."
