,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's the maximum I'm able to pay. ",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is your maximum offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product holds for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's my absolute limit. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,7,
