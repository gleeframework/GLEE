"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high for him, and he has room to negotiate.  He should aim to get the price closer to his $10,000 limit."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He is still trying to get the price closer to his $10,000 limit and can continue to negotiate. He can try another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's the maximum I'm able to pay. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is your maximum offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,000 is closer to his limit, he can still try to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal.  He is only $1,000 away from his target price, and it's worth trying to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's my absolute limit. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  He has been negotiating with Alice for a while, and while Alice has come down in price, she's still not willing to meet his target.  It's likely that further negotiation will take more time and might not result in a better deal. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his desired price, saving him time and potential frustration."
