"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product,  $120 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",80.0,Bob,2,

In light of that, we would like to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product at a slightly reduced price of $95. This still allows us to cover our costs while providing you with a great deal. Please let us know if this revised offer meets your needs.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $80. It's my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  I really appreciate your flexibility.  $85 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $80.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this transaction.",80.0,Bob,6,
