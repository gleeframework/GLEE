Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Considering its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 48 hours."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong offer that still leaves me with a significant profit margin above Bob's perceived value.
* **Time Limit:** The 48-hour limit creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Why this strategy works:**

This approach balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, I earn a higher profit. If he declines, I can proceed with John knowing I secured the best possible outcome."
