"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that benefits both sides.  I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. This gives you a significant advantage, while still allowing me to make a good profit.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is a bit too high. There's room for negotiation, and you know John provides a fallback option. By rejecting, you signal that you're looking for a better deal."
