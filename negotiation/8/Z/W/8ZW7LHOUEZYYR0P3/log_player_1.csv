Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss the price further."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing specifics.
* **Open to negotiation:**  Inviting Bob to ""discuss the price further"" signals flexibility and encourages him to engage in a negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering a price Bob might consider if he values the product highly."
