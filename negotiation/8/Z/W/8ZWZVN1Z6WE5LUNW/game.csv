"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on $11,000?  I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13,000. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $15,000 to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we settle at $13,200? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",13200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we're getting close.  How about we make one final push and meet in the middle at $12,600?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",12600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $12,600. I'm willing to make one last push, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we settle at $13,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,7,
