Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations much higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line, justifying the high price.
* **Urgency & Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it's not ridiculously so. This leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially still secure a price significantly higher than his perceived value."
