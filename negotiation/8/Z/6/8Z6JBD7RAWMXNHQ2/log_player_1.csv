Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $20,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low. There's always room to negotiate down. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high offer of $20,000, we set an anchor point. This might make Bob more receptive to a lower counter-offer, even if it's still significantly above his perceived value.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000,  giving us leverage.  We're not desperate to sell to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the price, consider countering with a lower amount, but never go below your minimum of $15,000."
