"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. It makes sense to negotiate down from this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the current market."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $14,000 is still significantly higher than your ideal price and what John is offering. You have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $11,500? That's a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing this product."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $11,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to emphasize that this is my final concession. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is presenting this as her ""final offer,"" you still have room to negotiate.  She's dropped $5,000 from her initial ask, suggesting she's motivated to sell. You're getting closer to your walk-away point, but it's worth seeing if you can get her closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is important to you, and I'm willing to be fair. $13,000 is a bit too high for me, but I'm prepared to offer $12,250. That's a significant move on my part and shows how serious I am about buying this from you today."", 
""product_price"": 12250
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $12,250 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $12,250, which is $12,625. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably and is now only slightly above the halfway point between her initial offer and your ideal price.  While you could try to negotiate further, you risk her walking away, forcing you to buy from John at $8,000.  Accepting this offer secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of missing out entirely."
