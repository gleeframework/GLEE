Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your $800,000 minimum.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** Leaving room for negotiation and giving Bob a sense of getting a good deal.
* **It shows you're serious:**  A firm offer demonstrates your willingness to engage in a meaningful negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While he's willing to pay a premium, it's not enough. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go below $850,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $775,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price. Additionally, the negotiation process is getting prolonged and there's no guarantee of a successful outcome. 

Selling to John for $800,000 is the safer and more efficient option. You secure your minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
