"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider a lower price of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1000000.0
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so my counteroffer is $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I see the value in the product, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle of our last offers at $937,500?",937500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,950000.0
"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate a good deal. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $937,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. My new counteroffer is $950,000, as you requested, plus a small premium of $2,500. This brings the total to $952,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",952500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  I can tell you're serious about selling this product, and I am serious about buying it. However, that small premium you added is a dealbreaker for me.  If you're willing to come down to $945,000, I'm ready to make this happen.",945000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,960000.0
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the premium, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, and $945,000 is still a bit below my target. I can meet you halfway between $945,000 and $952,500, which is $948,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make it happen.",948750.0,Alice,7,,
