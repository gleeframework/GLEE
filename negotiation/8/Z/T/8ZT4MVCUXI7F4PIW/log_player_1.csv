Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $115 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Above Minimum:** This price is comfortably above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  While John provides a safety net, the focus is on securing the higher profit from Bob."
