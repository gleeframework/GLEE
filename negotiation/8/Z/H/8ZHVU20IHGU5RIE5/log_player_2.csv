Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue working towards a deal. However, $750,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower my price to $825,000. This is a fair price that allows you to profit while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on the product's value. I hope you'll consider this offer seriously.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're making progress, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $800,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's close this deal.

This is the best possible outcome for you, Bob. Alice has reached her absolute minimum, which is still a significant discount from John's offer. Accepting now guarantees you the product at the best price."
