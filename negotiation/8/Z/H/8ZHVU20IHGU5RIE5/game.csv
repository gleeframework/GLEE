"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, given its potential to generate $1,000,000 in value. I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its significant worth.  Consider this my initial proposal: $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that the product is valuable, but I think your initial price is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still allows you to realize a substantial return on your investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to move my offer up to $750,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue working towards a deal. However, $750,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower my price to $825,000. This is a fair price that allows you to profit while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on the product's value. I hope you'll consider this offer seriously.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're making progress, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $800,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,7,
