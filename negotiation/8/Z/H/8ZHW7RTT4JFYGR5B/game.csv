"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price of $1,450,000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident it will be a fantastic investment for you. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm a savvy buyer, and I've done my research on the product's market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but my counteroffer is $1,350,000.  It's still a great price for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. That's my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your persistence. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've been very patient with your negotiation, but I'm starting to run out of time.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm only willing to go down to $1,290,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and if you're truly serious about this deal, this is our last chance. ",1290000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,290,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, but I'm not going any higher. That's my final offer.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
