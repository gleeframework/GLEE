"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $82.50 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is fair for both of us.  What do you say?",80.0,Bob,4,
