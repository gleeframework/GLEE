You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less. He should counteroffer Alice to see if he can negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $16000. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for less from John. He should counteroffer Alice again and try to push her price lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I can meet you halfway between $14000 and $16000, so I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I have another buyer who is willing to pay the full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice's final offer is $15,000, which is still above Bob's budget. At this point, Bob should realize that he's unlikely to get a lower price from Alice. He should accept John's offer and buy the product for $12,000.  This saves him $3,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
