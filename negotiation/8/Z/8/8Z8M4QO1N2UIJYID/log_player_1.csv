``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to capture some of the surplus value for myself. I'm also emphasizing the product's value to Bob and framing it as a good opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $775,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter in the next round, aiming to land somewhere closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a little ways off from my target price. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $790,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $790,000. Would you consider $782,500? I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $782,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $782,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While we're getting closer, I'm not convinced I can get a better price in the remaining rounds. To ensure I don't miss out on a guaranteed sale, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000."
