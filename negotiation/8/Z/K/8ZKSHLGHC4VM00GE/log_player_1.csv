{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've stated the product is worth at least $15,000 to you, so $17,000 is a good starting point to make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for a potential back-and-forth with Bob without you having to immediately drop your price.
* **It's within Bob's value range:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so he has room to potentially accept this offer.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response, or even choose to accept a counteroffer if it's beneficial to you. You also have the backup option of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get a higher price,  Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price John is offering.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potential loss of the deal."
