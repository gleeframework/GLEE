Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A starting price of $15,000 represents a 50% markup, which is significant but not outrageous. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as an ""investment"" rather than just a cost. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters or expresses hesitation. You can always adjust the price downwards, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
