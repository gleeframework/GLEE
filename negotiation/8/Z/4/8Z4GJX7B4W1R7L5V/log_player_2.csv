"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's target price of $1,200,000. There's significant room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price considering your asking price and the value I'm placing on the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using a bold strategy here, aiming for a significant price reduction. By offering $700,000, he's demonstrating his seriousness about the product while also leaving room for negotiation. This counteroffer is well below Alice's floor of $800,000, so it's likely to be rejected, but it's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more to you than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product and the original price I was willing to sell it for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his target. Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation to achieve a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still outside my budget.  To reach an agreement, I'm offering $800,000. This price is fair considering the value I place on the product and the price you're willing to sell it for. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing closer to Alice's floor price with this counteroffer. $800,000 is a significant drop from Alice's previous offer, showing his commitment to getting a better deal.  This move increases the likelihood of a successful deal while still remaining within his budget."
