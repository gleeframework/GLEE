"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm glad you like it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I see you're still interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to be more flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can do $137.50. That's my bottom line, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",137.5,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think you really like this product, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $135. That's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let's make a deal!",135.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to see eye-to-eye on the price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but this is my last one. I can do $132.50. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",132.5,Alice,9,
