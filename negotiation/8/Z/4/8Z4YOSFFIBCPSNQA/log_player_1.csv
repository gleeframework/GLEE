Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, giving Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm confident that Bob is interested in the product and I can likely get him to come up slightly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}

I'm countering with $9,800. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise and agrees to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,600. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this offer is still significantly higher than my minimum value and selling to John.  It's a good compromise that secures a profitable sale for me."
