# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm interested in the product, but I'm trying to save some money. Since Alice is willing to sell it to me for $100, which is lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($120), I'll accept her offer.
