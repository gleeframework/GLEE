Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is $100, there's room for Bob to negotiate down a bit, making him feel like he's getting a better deal. 
* **Above my Minimum:** The price is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($80), ensuring I make a profit even if I need to negotiate slightly.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
