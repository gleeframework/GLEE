Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is too low for me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you have it.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $9,000 is the maximum I can stretch to. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we're already on round 4.  I'm not confident we'll reach a mutually acceptable price in the remaining rounds.  It's best to sell to John for $10,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid further negotiation."
