"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you have it.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $9,000 is the maximum I can stretch to. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
