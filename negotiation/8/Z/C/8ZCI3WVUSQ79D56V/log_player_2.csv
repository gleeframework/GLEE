"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
The product is worth $80 to you, so you shouldn't accept an offer for $120. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is closer to your ideal price, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  You're comfortable spending $80, so rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering again is the best choice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $100 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go to $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal then."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $105. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 
Alice is unwilling to come down to your desired price point, and it's likely further negotiation will only go in circles.  Buying from John for $80 is the most efficient way to get the product at your desired price."
