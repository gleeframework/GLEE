"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $100 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go to $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal then.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $105. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",105.0,Alice,5,
