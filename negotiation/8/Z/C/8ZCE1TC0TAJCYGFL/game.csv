"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the starting point, but I'm hoping to come in a bit lower.  Given my budget and the value of the product to me, I'd like to offer $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price.  However, $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $1,300,000.  I believe this is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
