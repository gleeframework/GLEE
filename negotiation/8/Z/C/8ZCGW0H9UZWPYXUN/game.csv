"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $1,200,000. I'm happy to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my own budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident this product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a significant savings for you while still allowing me to acquire the product. Let's close this deal and make it happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $1,320,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. If this offer is not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
