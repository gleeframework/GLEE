"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference again. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's fair given its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand my position. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
