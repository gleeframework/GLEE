"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate its value, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit below my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,000 is close, but I need to get a bit more for it to make sense for me.  Would you be willing to do $12,000?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
