"I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you the product for $112.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really like the product.",112.5,Alice,3,,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go.",108.0,Alice,5,,
