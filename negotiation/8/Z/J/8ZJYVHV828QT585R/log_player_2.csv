"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high for Bob's budget. It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but still a reasonable compromise considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, the price is still too high for Bob's budget. He can try to negotiate further and see if he can get a lower price. If not, he can always buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still too far from what I can afford. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident that this price is fair considering your value for the product and my budget constraints. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $1,050,000 is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price that's too high for Bob. He's close to his budget, but he can still try to get a lower price. He's not desperate yet, so he can continue negotiating with Alice. If he's not successful, he has the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price for the product, but $1,050,000 is still pushing my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and the fact that I'm ready to make a purchase now. Let's try to work out a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $975,000, which would be $1,012,500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,012,500 is still over Bob's budget. He's getting close, but he can still try to negotiate further and get a lower price. He's only used 7 of his 10 rounds, so he has time to keep trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,012,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $990,000, which is very close to your last offer and represents a significant compromise on my part. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a final agreement.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 990000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get at least $1,025,000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still too high for Bob. He's only got one round left, and it's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a lower price. Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees that Bob gets the product within his budget."
