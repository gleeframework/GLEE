Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I must respectfully decline your offer of $12,000. Given the current market conditions and the fact that there is another potential buyer interested, I believe we may not be able to reach an agreement. However, I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to meet my minimum price. While he increased his offer to $10,000, it's still a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $12,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds for a potentially smaller gain."
