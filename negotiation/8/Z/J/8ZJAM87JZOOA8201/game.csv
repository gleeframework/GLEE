"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I believe $12,000 might be too high for me to consider purchasing right now. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Let me know if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the current market situation, I am still only able to consider offers within the range of $8,500 - $9,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider.  To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  I'm willing to let it go to you for $12,000, but that's my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I must respectfully decline your offer of $12,000. Given the current market conditions and the fact that there is another potential buyer interested, I believe we may not be able to reach an agreement. However, I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
