"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which holds significant value for you at $15,000. I am offering it to you at a special price of $12,000, aiming to ensure a fair transaction while maximizing my earnings. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations and we can proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John if necessary.  This gives you room to negotiate. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and might encourage her to come down closer to her $8,000 value."
