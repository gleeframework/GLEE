"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14000. It's a steal considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. There are 9 rounds left, and it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Bob can secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $13,000, Bob is still getting a good deal, as it's below his maximum budget of $15,000. It's also within the reasonable negotiation range.  Accepting this offer avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds and potentially ending up paying more."
