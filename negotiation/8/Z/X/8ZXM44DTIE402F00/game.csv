"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant and my initial offer already reflects a willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $975,000? This recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product, I'm happy to offer you $900,000. It's a fair price, and it's closer to my budget. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,4,
