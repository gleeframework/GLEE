"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant and my initial offer already reflects a willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $975,000? This recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm going to reject and try to get a better deal. I'm willing to go as high as $850,000, but I'll see if I can get Alice closer to that number."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product, I'm happy to offer you $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position.  Let's make this simple - $950,000 and we have a deal. This is my final offer. It reflects the value of the product while acknowledging our negotiations.  What do you say?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $950,000 is still outside my budget.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I don't want to risk going over my limit and I'm confident John's offer is a good deal."
