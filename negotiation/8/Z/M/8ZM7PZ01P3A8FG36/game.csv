"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $2,000,000 represents a significant discount from my initial valuation.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $1,600,000? This price recognizes the value you're gaining while allowing me to achieve a fair return.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
