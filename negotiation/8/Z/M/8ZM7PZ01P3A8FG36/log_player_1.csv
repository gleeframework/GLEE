Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming to get closer to my minimum. Let's see if Bob is willing to go a bit higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. Can you consider this offer?

Bob is unlikely to move much beyond his $1,300,000 offer. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
