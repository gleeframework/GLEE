"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is too high. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm not comfortable with that price point.  I'd like to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction.  He starts by making a counteroffer that's $100,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within the range of a potential agreement. It's important to note that this is just the start of the negotiation. Bob will need to be prepared to adjust his counteroffer based on Alice's response in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal.  There's still room for compromise, and rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going. It's important for Bob to remember that he has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, which gives him leverage during the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to chip away at the price. By offering $875,000, he's demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a firm stance. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, suggesting a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $890000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is now very close to Bob's desired price range.  While Bob could continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal or Bob will run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees Bob the product at a price that is still within his budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
