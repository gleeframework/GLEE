**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. You can try to negotiate further to see if you can get a price closer to your $10,000 target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is my final offer, I'm not going any higher than this.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $13,000 is still above your budget.  Since you're not willing to go higher, and you're only looking to spend $10,000, it's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John for his fixed price of $10,000."
