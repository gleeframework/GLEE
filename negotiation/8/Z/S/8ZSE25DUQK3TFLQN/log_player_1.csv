``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but still allows for room to negotiate.  I'll see what Bob's response is before deciding whether to lower the price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is too low, and I don't want to continue negotiating with him.  I'll accept John's offer of $15,000 to ensure a quick and secure sale."
