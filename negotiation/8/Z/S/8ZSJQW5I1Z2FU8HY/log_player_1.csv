Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to him, I'll try to get a good price for myself. I'll offer it to him for $130.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer is lower than what I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, I think I can do better than $125. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob a price of $127.50. This is a bit higher than his offer, but still lower than the $150 it's worth to him.
