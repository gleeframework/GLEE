"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I believe we can find a price that benefits us both.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point that gives us both room to negotiate.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still feeling a little stretched at $1,300,000.  Would you consider $1,250,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,275,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
