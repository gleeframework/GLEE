# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $975,000, which is $1,012,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500.

Alice is consistently meeting in the middle, and the price difference is getting smaller.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are likely less than the risk of Alice walking away.  Accepting $1,012,500 secures a good deal."
