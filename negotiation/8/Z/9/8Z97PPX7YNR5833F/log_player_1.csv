Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'll start by offering it to him at a price that is slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 850,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks of this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is higher than the $800,000 I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option (3) and sell the product to John for $800,000.
