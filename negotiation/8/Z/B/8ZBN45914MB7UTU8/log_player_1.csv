Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly downward.
* **Secure the Higher Sale:** While Alice has John as a backup, selling to Bob at $9,000 is significantly more profitable than John's guaranteed $8,000."
