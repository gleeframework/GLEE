"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $14,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. While I value the product, $13,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
