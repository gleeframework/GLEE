"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $92? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
