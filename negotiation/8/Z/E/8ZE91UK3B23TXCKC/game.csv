,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it's the maximum I can pay right now.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this time.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $92? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",92.0,Alice,5,
