"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  $900,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, hoping to start a strong negotiation. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also willing to haggle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price and within my budget.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice will reject my counteroffer and we'll run out of time.  It's better to secure a good price now than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
