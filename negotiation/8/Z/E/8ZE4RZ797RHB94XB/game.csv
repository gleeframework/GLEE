,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $11,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm firm on my offer of $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it allows for both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $10,500 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still leaves you with a great deal. Let's try to find common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer to $10,750. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can close this now.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,750 is still too far from my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's work together to close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,
