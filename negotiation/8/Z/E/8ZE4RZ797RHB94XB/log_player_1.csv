"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you're willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to take $10,500, I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $11,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm firm on my offer of $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it allows for both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob is firm on his offer of $10,500, it's still far below my minimum price.  It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay $15,000.  I can afford to hold out for a better price with Bob, or go with John if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $10,500 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still leaves you with a great deal. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer to $10,750. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can close this now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer to $10,750, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000, so I have no reason to settle for a lower price at this point.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away if the price doesn't reach a point that's beneficial to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,750 is still too far from my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
