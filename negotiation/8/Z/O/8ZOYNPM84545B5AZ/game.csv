"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product can bring to my business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that amount. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
