Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $119. I know you'll find value in it!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so offering it slightly above that might entice him.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no need to go below that.

By offering the product at $119, we create a win-win scenario where Bob feels like he's getting a deal (saving $1 from his valuation) and we secure a profit close to the maximum."
