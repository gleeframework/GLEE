"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value to me, I can offer $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and my budget. If you're not willing to accept, I'll need to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,4,
