"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given its value to me, I'd be happy to pay $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,750. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,000? This would be a fair deal, considering I'm very interested in the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I can offer it to you for $13,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",13250.0,Alice,5,
