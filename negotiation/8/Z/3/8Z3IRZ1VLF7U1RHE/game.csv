"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $145 for it. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $145 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $138? That's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",138.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $138 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $138, which would be $134. Can you do that for me?",134.0,Bob,4,
