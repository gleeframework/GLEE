Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price and allows you a sizable profit margin.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still allows me a healthy profit. 
* **The message is friendly and persuasive**.  It highlights the benefits to Bob and positions the offer as a win-win. 
* **This strategy balances:**
    * **Maximizing my profit:** I'm starting high, leaving room for negotiation.
    * **Securing a deal:** The discount makes the offer attractive, encouraging Bob to consider it.
    * **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response and my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that still allows you a decent profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even below my initial offer of $1,000,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept a price that drastically undercuts my desired profit margin.  

I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  This will allow me to:

* **Maintain my negotiating position:**  Rejecting his offer signals that I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Explore a compromise:** My counteroffer will be closer to my desired price, leaving room for a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Maintain the potential to sell to John:**  I still have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price gives you a good profit margin while ensuring I can meet my minimum requirements. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $800,000:** This is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.  It demonstrates flexibility while ensuring I still make a profit.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes the profit margin for Bob, appealing to his self-interest and framing the offer as a win-win. 
* **Openness to compromise:** The message suggests a willingness to continue negotiating, encouraging Bob to reconsider his offer.

This counteroffer balances the need for a profitable sale with the need to maintain a strong negotiating position. It also keeps the door open for a potential deal with Bob while providing a clear alternative with John."
