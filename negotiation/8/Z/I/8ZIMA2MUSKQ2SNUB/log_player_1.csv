Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. I believe it holds significant value and can benefit you greatly."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired value."
