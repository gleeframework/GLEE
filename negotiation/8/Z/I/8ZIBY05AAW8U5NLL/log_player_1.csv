Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm not ready to sell for $75, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? "", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $85 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. How about we meet at $80? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would love to continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum. I can't afford to go lower, and John is willing to pay the same price. It's a fair deal, and I'll take it."
