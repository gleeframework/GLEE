Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is higher than your minimum of $120, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below John's offer:** This keeps John as a backup option if Bob doesn't accept.
* **It's close to Bob's perceived value:** $115 is relatively close to $100, making it more likely Bob will consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  $105 is less than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **John is a better option:** Selling to John guarantees you $120, which is a better deal than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is too low, rejecting it allows you to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell it at a decent profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows you are willing to negotiate but still maintain your profit margin.
* **Counteroffer is lower than your initial offer:** This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Counteroffer is still above your minimum:** $110 is higher than your minimum of $120, so you're still earning a profit.
* **Message is friendly and encouraging:** The message is positive and focuses on a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105 again? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** $105 is lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees you $120, which is a better deal than accepting Bob's offer and potentially continuing to negotiate.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to improve:** Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge significantly. Continuing the negotiation might result in a lower price or wasted time.

By selling to John, you ensure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who is not willing to meet your minimum price."
