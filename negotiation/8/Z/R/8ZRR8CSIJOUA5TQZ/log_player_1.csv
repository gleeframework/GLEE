Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my minimum acceptable price might entice Bob.
* **Create Urgency:** By presenting it as a ""take it or leave it"" deal, Bob might be more inclined to accept, fearing he'll miss out. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for my desired price.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while still maintaining a safety net."
