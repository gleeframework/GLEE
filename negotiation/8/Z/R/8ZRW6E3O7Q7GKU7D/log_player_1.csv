Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? It's a win-win in my book."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget.  Could we try $9,300? I think that's a fair compromise.
