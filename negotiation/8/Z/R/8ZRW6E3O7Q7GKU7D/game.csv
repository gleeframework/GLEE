"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. I think it's a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? It's a win-win in my book.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget.  Could we try $9,300? I think that's a fair compromise.",9300.0,Bob,4,
