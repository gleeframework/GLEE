"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I've already received another offer from another buyer who is willing to pay the full value of the product to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're interested, this is a one-time offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's message is a negotiation tactic. She's trying to create a sense of urgency and make you think you'll miss out if you don't accept her price.  Since you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, there's no reason to pay Alice $12,000."
