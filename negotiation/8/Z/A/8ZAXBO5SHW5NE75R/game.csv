"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I'm afraid $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my limit. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your limit, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
