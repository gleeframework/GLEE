"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While it's closer to what I need, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the significant value this product brings and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
