"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire a remarkable product that holds immense value for us at $1,500,000. Given its worth to you, which we estimate at $800,000, this could be an excellent investment for you. I understand that such a significant transaction requires careful consideration, and I am here to answer any questions or provide further information you might need. Let's discuss how we can make this a mutually beneficial deal. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is offering the product for its full value to her, which is significantly more than your maximum price.  It's highly unlikely she'll come down to a price that makes sense for you. Buying from John at $800,000 is the best choice."
