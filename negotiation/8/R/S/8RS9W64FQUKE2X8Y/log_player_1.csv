Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market conditions and the product's value. I'm getting close to considering John's offer, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

While ideally, we'd want to get closer to $1,500,000, Bob's mention of John's offer signals he's nearing his limit. Accepting at $1,450,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away."
