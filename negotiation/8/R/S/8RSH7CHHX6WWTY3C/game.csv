"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $8500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $8250. This is a fair price, and it's the final offer I can make. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",8250.0,Bob,6,
